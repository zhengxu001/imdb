kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie! panaghoy sa suba is very good -- it has the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that will make you laugh.while the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, japanese occupation, rebellion, american as lord), its presentation is something cool, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the filipino, nipongo for the japanese and english for the american.this movie will go as one of this year's best pinoy movies.go watch this!

well it's been a long year and i'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004. panaghoy sa suba (call of the river) placed second in the recent metro manila film festival. as expected, it didn't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies.it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen. i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director. his great vision and creativity really helped this film. he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film. also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio. she did a great job portraying bikay, the younger sister of duroy. i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres. i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her.some of the camera shots in the film were done very well. the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different.in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film. i certainly won't be raving about the story of this film.

i'm grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once-moribund visayan film understorey. "panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular (that claims more speakers than tagalog). the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines. downside: the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist. the other item that i didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the "period" costume of the same character, and above all, his bright red kit-car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster. without those small yet glaring details, "panaghoy" would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating--daghang salamat, manoy cesar! addendum: this film sure beats peque gallaga's "oro, plata, mata", which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war. alos, there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg's "the color purple" and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of "noli me tangere".

wilhelm grimm (alexander knox) stands trial for nazi crimes. three witnesses give evidence - father warecki (henry travers), wilhelm's brother karl (erik rolf) and wilhelm's former lover marja (marsha hunt) - before wilhelm speaks in his own defense. the film ends after the court sums up....the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand. the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna (shirley mills), who wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service where willie grimm (richard crane) denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina (dorothy morris), marja's daughter, after she has been shot at a brothel.throughout the film, knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man. martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest. this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.

this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed. while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were, this film, unlike other hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities.the film begins in a courtroom in the future--after the war is over (the film was made in 1944--the war ended in may, 1945). in this fictitious world court, a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes. wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. at first, it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis. however, after a while, it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster. these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama.all in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second-tier actors. there are many compelling scenes and performances--especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears. it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first. overall, it's a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film.fyi--this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film, but hitler was referred to as "that paper hanger". this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper. this is in fact not true--previously he'd been a "starving artist", homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi. a horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!

never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example: norway. the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates. alexander knox, ( wilhelm gimm)"gorky park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town. he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either. as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind. marsha hunt,(marja pacierkowski),"chloe's prayer", played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm. there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives. the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers. if you have not seen this film, and like this subject matter, give it some of your time; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly.

the only reason i give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies, in my opinion, that are perfect. this little b picture is a taut story, well told. i've always been intrigued by alexander knox, but have seen him very few movies. here he plays wilhelm grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse. the performance is one of the most chilling performances i've ever seen. since world war 2, actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars. i imagine that since this was made during the war, the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil. but knox puts in that kind of performance--a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer. i still can't get over it.marsha hunt, who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly, is cast against type in probably the best performance i've ever seen her give, too. maybe not oscar worthy, but the best of her career. nothing against her; i have enjoyed her in those "slight" roles she often played. but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.if you like human drama stories, or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis, i highly recommend this fine little film.

this one is tough to watch -- as an earlier reviewer says. that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii -- particularly the "liberation" of dachau. it is clear that, as of the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the jews. the sequence that shows a "transport" is vivid, almost as if based upon an actual newsreel (the nazis liked to record their atrocities). knox as the nazi is brilliant. he charts the course of a nazi career. that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans, at first laughing at hitler, then incredulous, and finally helpless. that contrast, however, permits us to believe in the "conversion" of one young nazi officer to an anti-nazi stance. that did happen, as witness the several attempts against hitler, most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out. a strong film, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended.

there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series.rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america.overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.

the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler's grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe. clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the "allied bias" turning out to be historical fact. the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east. the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. the disparity between hitler's military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag, declaring "peace in our time" to this day has durable propaganda qualities. here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options, freedom or slavery. in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively.

adolf hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u.s. war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii. hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived, starting with the conquest of eastern europe, expanding to the european heartland, then moving on to the 'world island' consisting of europe, asia and africa. his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world.in 1935, hitler ordered national conscription, as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. grade school children sang his praises, and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. marching unopposed into austria in 1938, hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland. in 1939, hitler took all of czechoslovakia. later in the year, the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non-aggression pact with it's mortal enemy russia, a ploy to delay hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. immediately after, germany invaded poland, bringing hitler's conquest right to russia's doorstep. he would deal with her later.it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler's thrust across europe. prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany, his infamous declaration stating 'peace in our time'. it didn't turn out that way.the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment, at least to me, was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid '30's. it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland. the venue - madison square garden!

this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war. the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler's rise.every school child, nay, every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos. history has been repeating itself over and over again! the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups, are still working to these evil group's advantage.by sitting back and letting hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - france, america and england caused over 50 million people's deaths. americans, french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties.these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs. they don't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them, fighting hitler. this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war.

i don't understand. not being a critic, i am not evaluating the quality of the acting, which i find believable, a good thing. my confusion lies with the content. is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country. should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so, what effect their cheating "wives'" infidelity had on them? while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness, did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily? they didn't think of their husbands at all! only of themselves. pardon me, except when they wished their husbands dead.

stuck in a hotel in kuwait, i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning. first pachelbel's canon brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a tiger moth (which my grandfather, my father and i have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe's name hooked me completely. i was entranced by this film, crowe's performance (again), the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we owe), how various matters were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew avro ansons, too), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, crowe's recitation of high flight. i won't spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles, as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot, i admit to crying heartily a couple of times. buy it, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal it - but watch it.ps did i spy a bristol blenheim (in yellow training colours)on the ground? looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 brownings in a dorsal turret.

i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched. that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents, attempting to make sense of a world at war. the ending and use of pachabel's cannon are both amazing.

i felt this film - throughout. i waas impressed with russell crowe's talent in developing his relationship with lillie, such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach, a bit self depreciating and very persistent. really loved the cinematography and direction. pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive.gosh, didn't russell's talent even in 1993 shine! .. and i have yet to see gladiator.

i have just seen this film, and fallen in love with it. there is a little bit of something for everyone, and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between lachlan and lil. when they are on the beach, i nearly cried... there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together. this idea taken from several angles, from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places. the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last. crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan. i've always had a soft spot for the accent, but i nearly melted with his portrayal of his character. the way this film was shot is also beautiful, with the music, backdrop of the open fields, and superb acting. all together, this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions.

i enjoyed every moment of this movie, even though i knew they could never really be together. with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks, it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940's who must have lived this story.

russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this film. but more than that, the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow. everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity. fabulous love story between lachlin and lil. i replay their scenes over and over again. anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. all characters are cast and portrayed excellently.

very nicely done movie. it does stay in your memory. better billed as a romance than flying or war, altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free. flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love.fun watching early crowe. he is good and exudes charm. his reading of "high flight" is superb.cheers, boom

this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life. we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight. a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don't just happen on the front.luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents went through during a war. this film, i think, is a small thank you. peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o'toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be. it's definitely worth listening to him recite "high flight" and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare.

a major moneymaker for rko radio, bombardier stars pat o'brien and randolph scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots. o'brien and scott argue over teaching methods, while their students vie for the affections of anne shirley. o'brien's methods prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo. scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese, but the mortally wounded scott manages to set fire to a gas truck, providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers. stylistically, bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films, with moments of subtle poignancy (the death of trainee eddie albert) alternating with scenes of ludicrous "yellow peril" melodrama (the japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless americans). though it can't help but seem dated today, bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort (the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of robert ryan, who'd actually been appearing before the cameras since 1940.anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com

i wasn't sure at first if i was watching a documentary, propaganda film or dramatic presentation. i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three.admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on. we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment.where this movie came together for me was closer to the end. the scenes had a realism (at least as i perceived it) that i haven't encountered often before. you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants. this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce.the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan. also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years.

there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public. seen today, some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda--which they technically are, but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation. this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre--having a pretty realistic script and good production values. pat o'brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films (you know, the tough-talking, hard-driven but "swell guy"). randolph scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardiers in training). while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews, the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. that it, perhaps, except for the very end--where the film is a bit over-the-top but also very satisfying. about the only serious negative, and this is mostly for nitpickers, is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and "nuts" like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this--all others probably won't notice.

has anyone been able to buy this movie? my uncle "hutch" was a real (not reel) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings. he's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie. he was killed in a dogfight over italy, he was only 24 at the time. do we know the film studio that made it?or has anyone seen it at a video store, like blockbuster? i wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make dvd's these days.please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where i can buy a copy. thank you.

i saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show and fell in love with it.it took 30+ years, but i recently did find it on dvd - it wasn't cheap, either - in a catalog that specialized in war movies. we watched it last night for the first time. the audio was good, however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels. even so, it was better than i remembered it. i was also impressed at how true it was to the play.the catalog is around here someplace. if you're sincere in finding it, fire me a missive and i'll see if i can get you the info. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com

william wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss hart's hit broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: george cukor. the "women's director" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of air corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled chinese-american recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring. notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: lon mcallister, edmond o'brien, martin ritt, red buttons (in drag, as an andrews sister), peter lind hayes, karl malden, kevin mccarthy, gary merrill, lee j. cobb, and don taylor. also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as o'brien's worried-sick brooklyn spouse. too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after twentieth century fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon. it's disingenuous and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more widely seen.

this movie gets it right. as a former usaf aviation cadet, i can tell you this movie has it all. the tedium of the application process. the waiting for word. the joy of acceptance. the worry about making it through the course. the sorrow of watching one's buddies (perhaps the best of them)wash out. the anguish of paying the ultimate price - the death of fllow student airmen. the glory of graduation. always the flying, the flying, the flying. many are called but few are chosen. we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do.

this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a los angeles television station's "late show". the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture, and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape, nor is it ever shown on television (apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart, the playwright/producer/director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii -- the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made). i did not see the movie again for over 30 years, when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a "bootlegged" copy on vhs (poor video quality, but good audio). my memory of it was correct: it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch. an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars, just starting out in their careers at the time 1944), went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well-known and fully-employed actors (e.g. judy holliday, edmond o'brien, jeanne crain, barry nelson, don taylor, karl malden, peter lind hayes, george "superman") reeves, red buttons, lee j. cobb, kevin mccarthy, and gary merrill). the scenes with the b-24 liberators are terrific, especially the close-up shots where the details of the giant (for those times) 4-engine bomber (then 18,000+ manufactured, now nearly extinct) can be seen. good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot-cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew (of course, very gender-biased as was the trend of the day: only the men became pilots, the women just supported them in their roles -- hardly acceptable in today's world). i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy.

i had a personal interest in this movie. when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union. at the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc. for one or two weeks. when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego. just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn. once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton, the big marine base. there, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base. it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun entrenchments, sand-bagged trenches and living quarters. all this was at very high pay, sometimes 'golden time', which was triple our regular hourly wage. our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home.once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen. then it was no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens. a bit disappointing, but still fun. in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis, which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there. bob weverka

"in april 1946, the university of chicago agreed to operate argonne national laboratory, with an association of midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research. argonne thereby became the first "national" laboratory. it did not, however, remain at its original location in the argonne forest. in 1947, it moved farther west from the "windy city" to a new site on illinois farmland. when alvin weinberg visited argonne's director, walter zinn, in 1947, he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site. when zinn described a heavy-water reactor operating at one-tenth the power of the materials testing reactor under design at oak ridge, weinberg joked it would be simpler if zinn took the oak ridge design and operated the materials testing reactor at one-tenth capacity. the joke proved unintentionally prophetic."the s-50 plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns. it was built next to the k-25 power plant, which provided the necessary steam. much less efficient than k-25, the s-50 plant was torn down after the war.concerned that the atomic energy commission research program might become too academic, lilienthal established a committee of industrial advisers, and during a november visit to oak ridge, he discussed with clark center, manager of carbide & carbon, a subsidiary of union carbide corporation at oak ridge, the possibility of the company assuming management of the laboratory.prince henry (of prussia) arriving in washington and visiting the german embassy (1902). evidently, with prince henry of prussia according to the principles of science and its dangers their were already concerns with the applications of new science with military applications. the hohenzollern (1902/ii), "kaiser wilhelm's splendid yacht at the 34th st. pier, new york. taken at the exact moment of prince henry's arrival, and the raising of the royal standard." if royalty knew of these necessary precautions to citizen welfare then what was the necessity of the warfare wwi and wwii. the quality of management control i presume?thus, did the commandos of operation swallow volunteer for a military mission, or a business plan, based on the security principles of laboratory management? because supposedly their were no survivors, and the ones who were caught in europe ordered to be executed. of the 400 man commando team the survivors who were captured were executed under orders of the german army against subversion, and espionage acts of the state of germany. the führer no. 003830/42 g. kdos. okw/wfst, führer hq, 18 oct. 1942, (signed) adolph hitler; translation of document no. 498-ps, office of u.s. chief of counsel, certified true copy kipp major, declassified dod 5200.30 march 23, 1983, reproduced at the u.s. national archives.the oss society® 6723 whittier ave., 200 mclean, va 22101

i've received this movie from a cousin in norway and had to convert it from norwegian to american format with a copied video. comparing this film (1948) with the heroes of telemark (1965), kampen om tungtvannet (the struggle for the heavy water) casts the saboteurs themselves, playing their respective roles, though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in norway's struggle for freedom in later campaigns. the plot is in four languages: norwegian along with french, german and english (complete with norwegian subtitles).impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle. french scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from norsk hydro in vemork to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness. simultaneously, the nazis, too, were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon. the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by invading norway, and through secret codes, their man carefully eluded nazi spies on his trip to oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance. he was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner, but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him. this clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the nazis later forced down in hamburg.however, the invasion of norway on the morning of april 9, 1940, the nazis took over norsk hydro and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action. professor leif trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young norwegians; the "swallow" and "gunnerside" groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in vemork. this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation, including the sinking of the ferryboat after the nazis abandoned norsk hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to berlin.the quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film. i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history.

this movie is a half-documentary...and it is pretty interesting....this is a good movie...based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan, norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany.this movie isn't perfect and it could have been a bit better... the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves!!!if you're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that's worth a look!!

by saying that,i mean that this is not a well made movie but it's a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far.and if you are a ww2 buff then this is a treat for you,cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie. it's theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary.me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over-human heroes of the second world war,and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next generations.cause nowadays kids doesn't read books,they watch movies.so if you want a action extravaganza,rent private ryan,this is the truth about lingering pain,outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost.

i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen, because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war. the movie is impressive, not least because it actually happened. it reminds me of the story of anne frank.

this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war , and it really happen , not exactly as the movie , but it is a great story , i was impress by this film ,the acting and the story where great i like this film because it is a true story it's giff me a feeling that i was there and i feel sorry for the ca-rector that maruschka detmers is playing because who wants to end here life that way. i recommend that everybody have to see this film , special the young ones and ma by the learn something from this film. this film you can compare whit the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the ww2.

as a another reviewer states hanna's war is an outstanding film about an outstanding person, hanna "anniko" senesh, who would become the jewish joan of arc. unfortunately i diverge in opinion not agreeing that miss detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. in truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces. maruschka detmers performance is brave, poignant, heartfelt or understood, and totally believable. in other words for me "in the zone." from the opening credits. if you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give hanna's war with maruschka detmers a try. my hat is off also to ellen burstyn as hanna's mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film. in that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress' but not an all about eve situation.

it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings. by using the adjective 'shocking' i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was formerly unaware of them, it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off, either with or without a 'reason'.the first part of the film focuses on hanna's successful participation in the hungarian resistance. maruschka detmers would never have won an oscar for this performance, due to inconsistent directing, but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma. she is cast very well as hanna and immediately has our sympathy. her very beautiful looks help, of course, but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress, playing a good part.certain inconsistencies keep occurring in hanna's war. i sometimes get the idea director menahem golan (often despised for the gianni versace murder) was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene. on the other hand, i am very thankful he made this impressive and thought-provoking film and as i am very positive about it, i think he did a good job.the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one. it focuses on hanna's suffering (beware of donald pleasence's scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain rosza) and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war. i receive hanna's war, especially the second half, as a strong anti-war film and for that alone golan deserves credit. it is also this second half in which maruschka detmer's talent comes out, creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking, strong and tragic ever portrayed. it is also great to see ellen burstyn, whose appearance and acting style always remind me of romy schneider, who -had she been alive and cast- would have made a similar effective contribution to hanna's war.the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected, so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears. and when i realized once more it wasn't even fiction, it all actually happened, i found myself in even more tears. the image of hanna portrayed by maruschka detmers will be in my mind forever.

like his earlier film, "in a glass cage", agustí villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see. the heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical, yet never steps into it. in that way, it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye. unabashed, gorgeous, and highly tense... this film is simply superb!

if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues, let me tell you, you've chosen the wrong film.this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca, a small island off the coast of spain. when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once, there is no war in the open. the soldiers are sent to the front to fight, in the mainland, while another kind of war happens at home, on the small island. there, neighbours tell on other neighbours, sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime, but many people are told on because of old family fights, or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to "earn some points". and these things don't happen in the open. there were some trials, true, but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night, taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed. and the next morning the bodies would be found, and people would have an idea of what had happened, but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything. we're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life. we're talking about people killing their neighbours, and probably saying hello to their widow the next day, and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed. we're talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants, where everybody knew everybody.i am from that small island and i've heard the stories my grandparents told me, and i must say that this film upset me, oh yes, it did; but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving. the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up, that's how things happened during that war. a kid knowing that his mate's dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad? completely possible. all that happened later on? possible too. tb was real too. at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become. people were poor, illiterate, and worked in small farms. after the war there were times of hardship.so, you won't find a war story in this film, or at least not the kind of war story you expect. there are no battlefields, no soldiers, no political intrigues. this is the meanest kind of war, which happens when the space is limited (just check the size of the island), when neighbours fight with their neighbours, when members of the same family fight each other, and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody. you'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage, or maybe they don't.i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors, who managed to sound really majorcan. that was remarkable.

the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community, develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty. whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level, caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute, villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco. the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis.the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar's work with themes dealing with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic, gritty realism opposed to almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar.the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing.

film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless. gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception. it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits. the story is sweeping. it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind. roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen. supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity. sets, lighting, scenery and cinematography are wonderful. i absolutely love the photography.

i saw "el mar" yesterday and thought it to be a great movie. it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: ramallo, manuel tur, and francisca. after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again.religion, sickness, love, violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension-filled movie.i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story. it's a violent, intense and sad story. people are expected to suffer. to cry. to get hurt. to bleed. and i think that what the film shows, isn't done for pure shock-value or presented in a distasteful way. i know that some people like their films "clean", even those with violence in it. but sometimes, a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work. this is one of those movies. and a great movie it is.the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie, it all made sense. but it wasn't anything of much importance to the overall story, so i still give this movie a 9.

this film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. in fact, they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium. here we see what life has wrought on each of them. one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient. another man is a hustler who has become ill. the third child, a young lady, has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium. this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.this film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film. this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.

"el mar" directed by catalonian director agusti villarona, and based on the novel by blai bonet, offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country. the movie concentrates on three friends, and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca, to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium, lost in the countryside.we first meet three boys that are playing happily. not everything is what it seems. the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed. the boys have excluded a young girl, about their age, from taking part in their games.when we meet the adult ramallo again, he is on his way to a sanatorium. he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. to his surprise, manuel tur, one of his boyhood friends is also being treated, and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care. it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully. their relationship will have devastating consequences.roger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo. bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur, the vulnerable youth. antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction. angela molina, puts an appearance as carmen, the wife of the caretaker of the institution. simon andreu is perfect as alcantara."el mar" is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villarona's talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer.

el mar is a tough, stark, utterly brilliant, brave work of cinematic art. director agustí villaronga, with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet's novel, has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives. and though the focus is on war's heinous tattoo on children, the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear. this film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering: the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children's march toward adulthood.a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain, threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens. ramala (nilo mur), tur (david lozano), julia (sergi moreno), and francisca (victoria verger) witness the terror of the assassination of men, and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide. these wide-eyed children become adults, carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds.we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium. ramala (roger casamajor) has survived as a male prostitute, protected by his 'john' morell (juli mira), and has kept his life style private. tur (bruno bergonzini) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion. francisca (antònia torrens) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium. the three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war. tur longs for ramala's love, ramala longs to be free from his morell, and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun's habit.the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death, between lust and love, and between devotion and destruction is played out. to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer, but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved (in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable. for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense. the actors, both as children and as adults, are splendid: roger cassamoor, bruno bergonzini and antònia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles. the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the director's vision. a tough film, this, but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath. in spanish with english subtitles.grady harp

here is the explanation screenwriter pamela katz gave me for why mvt introduced jg as a specific character in the film:"...the historical record is very clear: joseph goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to get goebbels himself into our film... for a woman like lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. the idea of getting to goebbels wasn't impossible for her, so that became our hook."those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.jan lisa huttner films for two

although the beginning of the movie in new york takes too long, the movie is a must see for people who like this genre. when hannah goes to berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war, the movie gets much much better.the movie is a bit like the pianist, can not really be compared.

the van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years. i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time!!the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york, and the impression i had of "trying to be as american as possible" ... which i think has absolutely failed.the scenes in the back really got to my heart. the german actress katja riemann completely deserved her award. she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen. in future i will watch more of her movies. great luck for me that i am a native german speaking =) and only for a year in the us, so as soon as i am back i'll buy some riemann dvds.so to all out there who have not seen this movie yet: watch it!!! i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet, especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain, but simply watcxh it, you will be zesty!!!!!!!

this was a wonderful film. how these women tried to save their husbands. i thought that the performances of the actors were great. i had to think about the film for a very long time. i think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. i liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be. i wish i could be so strong as a woman. i really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what i like to see in a movie. i think you can compare the film with der untergang, the pianist. if you put these three films together, you have a great sight of what happened during the war. we should remember something like the war forever.

spoilers within.it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen, das (1995).the direction seemed carefully controlled, and visually i felt it was highly appealing - especially where the visual narrative was concerned (the title-sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the past).to clarify two points that many people have been confused by:firstly, lena did not sleep with goebbels. although this may have seemed implied, it was not the intent. von trotta told me so herself! (and she is a very nice lady, by the way!)secondly, the time-frame of events was in fact historically accurate (the actual dates are shown on the close-up of the memorial) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film. there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this, and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free.overall, what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'over-movied' era. it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time (for various reasons) for this film to hit our screens.more of the same please, margarethe!

rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity. reichdeutch women find that their jewish husbands have been locked up pending deportation. one an aristocrat disowned by her family, lena fischer, finds herself among the mob as does general gudarian's sister. but rank and privilege merit no special consideration. nor does service to the reich as a female detainee whose husband is on the ostfront will learn. in one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband. lest you think this is typical german brutishness we in america today have lady bush imperiously ordering the arrest of gold star mothers (mothers of us service-members killed in action) because their very presence is offencive. little, regrettably, has changed in the 60 years from der fuher to der fumbler.fortunately the eight year old daughter ruth escapes capture.waiting in the cold on rosenstrasse lena fischer is at first reluctant to take in ruth responding in a way that we take as typically german. even lena fisher's brother colonel arthur von eschenbach who is aware of and opposed to the holocost cautions lena against it. but lena chooses to embrace the idea with an american rebelliousness even renaming ruth, the more aryan sounding name helga lehmann.the siege ends favourably on rosenstrasse but lena mourns: what happened to ruth after the war? years later ruth's daughter hannah sets out in search of her mother's past and meets 90 year old lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war.i did deem it interesting that hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the ostfront.

i saw this film at the toronto film festival, where it received a standing ovation! this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before--namely about the rosenstrasse (a street in berlin)uprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war. as such, it is a unique story, and what's more, is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans (the helping family in "anne frank" for instance was dutch) who did not support the nazis, and, in fact, had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the nazi regime, at the risk of their very lives. the acting is great across the board, the framing story in new york interesting and intricate, the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene, and the production values, including the gorgeous cinematography, outstanding. of course the family in new york could be speaking german. many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family--a common occurrence. so that criticism is unwarranted. to say more would spoil the experience. the film is long, but i did not look at my watch once. i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america, for not only is this film a masterpiece, but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler. if this film is playing in your area, i urge you to see it! you will be glad you did!

this isn't another searing look at the holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in berlin and some of the people that were involved. this film starts in the present time in new york city where ruth weinstein (jutta lampe) is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side. ruth's daughter hannah (maria schrader) slowly learns that her mother was raised by an aryan woman named lena fischer (doris schade) and so she travels to germany and locates the 90 year old who tells her about the events on rosenstrasse.*****spoiler alert*****lena talks about berlin in 1943 where the gestapo would hold all the jewish spouses in a building on rosenstrasse street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release. eight year old ruth (svea lohde) awaits for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets 33 year old lena (katja riemann) who takes her in. lena's husband fabian (martin feifel) is also inside and eventually she tries to socialize with nazi officers to get them to do something.this film is directed by margarethe von trotta who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in europe. this is not one of those nazi films where we view horrible acts of inhumanity to jews although we do see some severe treatment being issued out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved. this film isn't trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period. part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by riemann and young lohde and it's always good to see schrader (aimee & jaguar) in a pivotal role. this isn't a great film or something that's going to change your perspective on wwii but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place i think that reason alone is important enough to retell this true story.

goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored. in the aftermath of stalingrad the reich had decided to go for 'total war'. this is referred to in the film. part of this was to use women in the war effort, which germany had not previously done to any great extent. an ss massacre of women would have faced goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion. his preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible, on the basis that the jewish men could always be rounded up later. i understand the majority survived the war.his other problem was that the 'red' berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously. again a massacre of women could have cost the nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city.it was interesting that the majority of ss uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of german nationality, but were from german origins in other countries such as lithuania or latvia

another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin, an event i had not known of, that began in late february, 1943. the details are given in an addendum that follows this review.the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another, contemporary story that begins in new york city, in the present. here a well off, non-observant jewish woman, whose husband has just died, shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. she goes even further, demanding that her daughter's non-jewish fiancé leave the house.the distressed daughter, hannah (maria schrader) then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii, in berlin, her mother, then 8 years old, had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman. hannah drops everything, goes to berlin, and finds this woman, lena fischer, now 90. hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. it all seems rather too pat.the film thereafter improves, focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest, in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs. fischer at 33 (played magnificently by katja riemann), a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian (martin feifel), a jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site.the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again. while scenes in the present are color saturated, the 1943 scenes are washed out, strong on blue-gray tones.the quality of acting is generally quite good, what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta, new german cinema's most prominent female filmmaker, herself a former actress.the story of the protest is told simply. only one feature is lacking that would have helped: still-text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse, an outcome that was, as the addendum below makes clear, incredibly positive."rosenstrasse" has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics. overly long, needlessly layered, purveyor of gender stereotypes, manipulative with music: so go the usual raps. it is too long. but i found in this film an austere, powerful, spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained. i found nothing flashy, contemporary or manipulative in this depiction.the very absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my tension, which increased incrementally as the film progressed. you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute. the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward. i awoke often later in the night i saw the film, my mind filled with bleak, melancholic, chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film. for me, that happens rarely. (in german and english). my rating: 8/10 (b+). (seen on 05/31/05). if you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.add: the rosenstrasse protest: swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital, 1700 to 2000 jews, mostly men married to non-jewish women, were herded into rosenstrasse 2-4, a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlin.because these jews had german relatives, many of them highly connected, adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied poland.normally, those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east. but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case, wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address, first in ones and twos, and then in ever-growing numbers.perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest, although not all at the same time. women demanded back their husbands, day after day, for a week. unarmed, unorganized, and leaderless, they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reich.joseph goebbels, the gauleiter (governor or district leader) of berlin, anxious to have that city racially cleansed, was also in charge of the nation's public morale. on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women's actions. rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the "final solution," goebbels with hitler's concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz! to both hitler and goebbels, the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. but they were mistaken. almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war. the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction.

i'm always surprised about how many times you'll see something about world war 2 on the german national television. you would think they don't like to open old wounds, but there isn't a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war. perhaps it's a way of dealing with their past, i don't know, but you sure can't blame them of ignoring what happened. and it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies (think for instance about "der untergang" or "the downfall" as you might now it) which are also very realistic.one of those movies is "rosenstrasse". it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war, even though the movie starts with a family in the usa, at the present day. after hannah's father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasn't been very religious before. she doesn't know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from, but as she starts digging in her mother's troubled childhood, hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother's past.the fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising. for as far as i know, there hasn't been another movie that deals with this subject. (for those who didn't know this yet: being married to a so-called pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they weren't immediately sent to one of the concentration camps, but that they had to work in a factory). but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages, it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives. how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything within their power to free their men, once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrasse...the acting is really good and the story is very well written, although the way it was presented in the beginning didn't really do it for me (and that's exactly the only part that you'll get to see in the trailer). perhaps it's just me, but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day. at least of the part that is situated in the usa, because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother's past, definitely works.if you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war, and if you aren't necessarily looking for a lot of action shots, than this is definitely a movie you should see. this isn't a movie in which you'll see any battles or gunfights, but it certainly is an interesting movie, because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of. i give it an 8/10.

in rosenstrasse, margarethe von trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. the film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter, and the story of german women who staged a protest on rosenstrasse to free their jewish husbands from certain extermination. in addition to the dramatization of historical events, the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the holocaust by a german and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. while ms. von trotta shows that the courage of a small number of germans made a difference, she does not use it to excuse german society. indeed, she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination, the wealthy artists and intellectuals of german high society went on about their lives and parties, oblivious to the suffering.rosenstrasse opens in new york as a jewish widow ruth weinstein (jutta lampe) decides to sit shiva, a seven-day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased. when her daughter hannah (maria schrader), is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fiancé luis (fedja van huet), a non-jew, hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an orthodox tradition that she previously rejected. when ruth coldly rejects her cousin, hannah questions her and learns about a woman named lena who took ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the nazis, and she vows to find lena and discover the secret of her mother's past.her quest takes her to berlin where she finds lena (doris schade), now ninety years old, and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the holocaust. with unfailing memory, lena tells her story of how, as a young 33-year old woman (katja reimann), she searched for her husband, jewish pianist fabian israel fischer (martin feifel), who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given jews in mixed marriages. lena, in a radiant performance by reimann, discovers that her husband and other jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the rosenstrasse.standing together in the freezing night, german women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building, their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting "give us back our husbands". lena finds ruth (svea lohde), a young girl whose mother is in the building. she takes care of her, protecting her from the gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed. lena comes from an aristocratic german family and her brother, recently returned from stalingrad, is a wehrmacht officer. after being refused help from her father to free fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow officer, "i know what they do to the jews. i saw it". given his support, she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the minister of culture, joseph goebbels, a known womanizer. while this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters, it is a historical fact that goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting rosenstrasse.the director margarethe von trotta, an activist, feminist, and intellectual, is no stranger to political drama. she directed a film about socialist rosa luxembourg and marianne and julianne, a story of the relationship between two sisters, one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives. in rosenstrasse, a film she worked on for eight years, she had to make compromises, adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced. that it works so well is a tribute to ms. von trotta's artistry and the beautiful screenplay by pamela katz whose father was a refugee from leipzig. the events at rosenstrasse give the lie to germans, who say, "there was nothing we could do". now von trotta has shown the opposite to be true, that something could be done to resist the nazis. it is tragic that the example did not catch on.

berlin-born in 1942 margarethe von trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. she has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. "rosenstrasse," which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the new york times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews i've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. it is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal nazi regime by, of all peoples, generically powerless germans demonstrating in a berlin street.co-writer von trotta uses the actual rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the german capital during world war ii.the husband of ruth weinstein (jutta lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance, ruth not only "sits shivah" (the jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. her apartment in new york city reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. her american-born daughter, hannah (maria schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox jewish practices but they pitch in. the mother coldly rejects the presence of hannah's fiance, a non-jew named luis (fedja van huet). a domestic crisis might well erupt as ruth warns that she'll disown hannah if she doesn't give up doting, handsome luis. stay tuned.a cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in berlin. hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. this is very, very realistic. i grew up with parents who fled nazi germany just in time and i knew many children whose families, in whole but usually in part, escaped the holocaust. those days were simply not discussed.so hannah, having learned that a german gentile woman saved ruth's life, traipses off to berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. were she not, this would have been a very short film. but ruth, pretending to be a historian, locates 90 year-old lena fischer (doris schade), now a widow. as the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories lena tells her story, the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day berlin and the war-time capital.the young lena of 1943 (katja riemann) was a fine pianist married to a jewish violinist, fabian fischer (martin feifel). with the advent of the nazi regime he was required to use "israel" as a middle name just as jewish women had to add "sarah" to their names(incidentally i wish imdb had not given fabian's name on its characters list with the false "israel" included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by nazis as a mark of classification and degradation).while germany deported most of its jewish population to concentration camps, those married to "aryans" were exempted. for a time. until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were jewish women married to non-jews). the roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity.the young lena tries to locate her husband. all she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on rosenstrasse. the crowd of anxious women builds up, some piteously seeking help from german officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them ("jew-loving whore" being one appellation). as a subplot lena more or less adopts eight-year-old ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember, ruth is now sitting shiva in manhattan). the child ruth is fetchingly portrayed by svea lohde. through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. the men, and a handful of women, are released. as in the real story the nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story).von trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. hannah continues to prod the aging lena who slowly, one gathers, begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued, the child whose mother was murdered.the contrasts between rosenstrasse of 1943, a set, and the street today in a bustling, rebuilt, unified berlin provide a recurring thematic element. today's berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. von trotta makes that point very well.the main actors are uniformly impressive. lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). the older ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy new york life. hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. these things happen (although the times's critic appears not to know that).von trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. a scene with goebbels at a soiree enjoying lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. the suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical top-level hitler worshiper, to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. most of the german officers come from central casting and are molded by the erich von stroheim "copy and paste" school of teutonic nastiness. but that's understandable.the rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more jews could have been saved had more germans protested. unfortunately that argument is nonsense. the german women who occupied rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. most germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-semitism. that's why the rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. whether one buys or rejects the goldenhagen thesis that most germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-nazi endemic anti-semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on.the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was "a ray of light" in an evil time. most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. so "a ray of light" it was and von trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. and always will.9/10

rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have kept away many film goers looking for a pianist similar plot. fortunately, von trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary aryan german rather from a jewish standpoint. rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims. the pace of the film is introspective, poignantly slow, meditative. besides, the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted. rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative flaws are well discerned. another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters. nevertheless, this film is worth seeing. finally, rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past,trend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa, and recently, the controversial downfall. i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images.

excellent p.o.w. adventure, adapted by eric williams from his own book (a paperback copy of which forms part of my father's library) that was inspired by true events; it may well be the first film of its kind and, therefore, has a lot to answer for  not just similarly stiff-upper-lipped examples such as albert, r.n. (1953; which i'll be watching presently), the colditz story (1955) and danger within (1959) but higher-profile releases from the other side of the atlantic, namely stalag 17 (1953) and the great escape (1963). this, then, sets the basis pretty solidly: british soldiers interned in a german camp devise an ingenious plan of escape, borrowing a page from greek legend  burrowing from under a vaulting horse used during physical exercise and in full view of their captors! actually, the film is neatly split into two halves: the first deals with the slow process of digging the tunnel, culminating in the escape itself, while the latter stages depict their fortunes outside the camp as they try to make it to neutral sweden. typically of these british films, the cast showcases several established (leo genn), current (anthony steel) and up-and-coming (peter finch, david tomlinson and bill travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (anthony dawson, bryan forbes, michael goodliffe and walter gotell). the three leads/escapees are genn, steel and tomlinson: while the first two stick together, the latter goes his own way  only to run into the others on reaching safety. as can be expected, the narrative involves plenty of suspense and excitement; as with most male-centered p.o.w. sagas, too, female interest is kept to the barest minimum. director lee didn't have a lengthy career  with this and the somewhat similar (albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint) a town like alice (1956) his most noteworthy achievements  but he certainly milked every gripping situation in this case (even if, reportedly, delays in filming saw lee quitting his post prematurelyleaving producer ian dalrymple with the task of tying up loose ends!). anyway, worth special mention is the exquisite lighting (particularly during night-time sequences) throughout.

this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war (pow) camp, stalag luft iii, during the second world war. this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the gestapo (and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name). while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as tom, dick & harry), two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing 'classic' attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap-frog in the compound.initially containing one, and later with two pows hidden inside, the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position, near the fence, on a daily basis. while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse, the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire, under the wire, and into the woods. the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel. all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs (escaped successfully to their home base.). the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout. the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape. made with far less a budget than the great escape, the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape. the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie. the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, eric williams, and is, by far, the best pow escape story ever made into a movie. some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii. i give this movie a well deserved ten.

playing out as a sort of pre runner to the great escape some 13 years later, this smashing little british film plays it straight with no thrills and dare do well overkill. first part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists, whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach sweden. the film relies on pure characters with simple, effective, and yes, believable dialogue to carry it thru, and it achieves its aims handsomely. no little amount of suspense keeps the film ticking along, and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it adheres to, so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type ?.7/10

while thinking of "the great escape" i allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood. i had read and re-read the autobiographical novel from 1949 which inspired it, and when it came to the only cinema (we never used that word then , actually) in town that showed "foreign" films, i was first in line to buy my ticket.as someone brought up on wartime newsreels and propaganda films during wwii, i had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the memoirs and stories of men who were there in person. that extended later to a keen willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject, and eventually to read the equally compelling novels of hans helmut kirst and erich maria remarque, which provided an even deeper sensibility. the movie versions, however, were unlike this one in that they rarely delivered the goods.the medium of black-and-white film has never been served so well as it was in those years. i have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as do the deep chiaroscuros of films like "the wooden horse." if it is true that we are destined always to be captive to the images of our childhood, then i confess it freely.and there will never be another the likes of leo genn as the emblematic british war hero on film. not even sir alec.

the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british pow's during world war ii. it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues leo genn. anthony steele and david tomlinson (later george banks in mary poppins) are marvelous as the two heroes. the direction is taut and fast-moving throughout. highly recommended.

the wooden horse was one of the first "great" escape stories from world war ii, telling the true story of eric williams and others in their escape from stalag-lufft iii in october of 1943. i really like this film, but had to by it on vhs from amazon in england and get it transferred from pal format in the u.s. i read the book when i was in hight school, after having seen a portion of the film in the early 60's on t.v. the taunt drama of peter and john trying to escape from germany during the war is more realistic than the treck of the escapes portrayed in the great escape. this film is a lost treasure, that should be made more available to american audiences.

in 1943, a group of raf officers, including eric wiiliams, decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard. in 1950, it was decided to film his account, and it kick-started a peculiar british film genre- the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within (1959).the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched. there are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama, jump cuts or jacked up (somethings about to happen!) music. it is utterly of its time and works beautifully.leo glenn, anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (i suspect) non-actors. without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. they keep emotion out of their roles. as so many were, until recently, ex-service, i suspect they recreated their war time roles as 'officers and gentlemen'.this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. on the contrary, unlike most wartime escape films, the story doesn't end at the barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end.

this unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a pow escape during ww ii. the performances are incredible, especially anthony steele. the movie works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal. the dialogue is ingenious and rings very true. in fact, an unusual all-around authenticity puts this one head-and-shoulders above most war epics.

much underrated camp movie on the level of cobra woman, etc. photographic stills resemble rembrandt prints. sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout.

i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it. her dancing was very entertaining. i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance. the scenery was great too. yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful. we laughed at the silly kissing scenes, but that is what is great about old movies! i grew up with her on the munsters and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies. they may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her act and sing. i am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as i receive them. i have a large collection of her memorabilia.

miss decarlo's starring debut has everything the writers could come up with -- from the franco-prussian war to the us civil war, the great american west, san francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, stage coach bandits, and a chinese junk. just when you thought the plot couldn't get any screwier, it does. it's magnificent, taken tongue in cheek. decarlo's character (here called anna marie -- not salome, that's the role she dances) is loosely based on the career of the notorious lola montez, who was the mistress of the king of prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels. she did escape to the american west. there is a town in arizona called "salome, where she danced," based on the historical fact that lola montez did dance the role of salome there. stagecoach cleve and the russian nobleman who fall under her charms are not historically accurate, nor i assume is the chinese wise man with the scottish accent -- but it is one of my favorite all time camp classics and decarlo is breathtakingly beautiful throughout.

this movie is pretty cheesy, but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it's principles. there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well.the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie.i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran. sure it's not all that well done, but the premise is not at all bad.tom

everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes christopher walken.in vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows, including christopher walken. following a mad max 3 (!) thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.cut to the present (1991), and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente. he's successful at first, but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly, which leads walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of people.mcbain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police bothering.there's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from michael ironside's diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in america (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).it's out there for a quid. buy it if you have a sense of humour. see how many times you can spot the camera crew too.

ah, mcbain the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by "the simpsons" but it will also always  to me personally, at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90's action flick; directed by the cool dude who brought us "the exterminator" and starring two of the most ultimately badass b-movie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside (the latter with a cute little macho ponytail). i guess "mcbain" will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure, because there's no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture. the film is unimaginably preposterous (most action heroes take on a small gangster posse  mcbain takes on an entire country) and yet takes itself way too seriously. the script is a non-stop and incoherent spitfire of clichéd situations, nonsensical twists, compulsory sentimental interludes, grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings. it's a totally delirious movie; i loved it. vietnam pow mcbain's life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war. they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that mcbain is in santos' debt. eighteen years later, santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia. santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he's publicly executed on el presidente's balcony. his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower. mcbain and his former vietnam buddies, who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world, charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of whoop-ass. okay, let's not fool each other here. the fact you're reading a user- comment on "mcbain" already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low-budget b-movie action. one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of "mcbain". this list is totally accurate and i can only concur with it. heck, i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list (like the preposterous and needless heroic self- sacrifice of a soldier who doesn't even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbain's squad), but what's the point? you definitely know not to expect a 100% coherent and plausible masterpiece. we know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie, and it's maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out! this is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel. please don't expect another "apocalypse now". this particular motion picture relies on the ruff 'n tuff acting performances of the macho leads, a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings a cover of "brothers in arms".

i don't have much to add to my summary, this film ranks right up the there with top gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be. i for one don't think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable.i don't think it brings christopher walken's reputation down either as his reputation was on the wane back then anyway. it took pulp fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in. as for michael ironside, he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films. total recall, top gun. what i think is amazing is the budget this movie had. the scenes and actors and explosions etc. are quite amazing so obviously someone liked it quite a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. whoever he or she was i like them because i love this film! if anyone reads this looking for information on mcbain (and i seriously doubt there'll be too many) just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face!

first of all i'd just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels. mcbain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle. it has all of the classic elements of a late 80's/early 90's action film....the random gratuitous acts of violence (ie. when walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money), the snapping of necks, the guys on fire, the guys that get blown off buildings, and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings. walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as, "let's go sit..........out on the deck." and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store. if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.

when i first heard about the title, i thought of 'the simpsons', just like so many other reviewers, but when i saw the cast, i was completely stunned, that so many great character-actors would actually be in this! first of all, we have christopher walken (deer hunter, pulp fiction), who plays the title character, mcbain. he is rescued from a vietnam pow-camp by some of his buddies, one of which is santos (chick vennera, yanks), who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain (vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently), and tells him that he can re-do the favor to him, if he ever gets into trouble.then, 18 years later, santos and his sister christina (maria conchita alonso, the running man, predator 2) join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, el presidente (victor argo, taxi driver, king of new york), and when santos fails the mission, christina goes to mcbain for help.mcbain then asks his good ol' vietnam buddies to help him. first there's the token tough black guy, eastland, played by "american ninja"'s steve james, who was also in director james glickenhaus' previous movie, "the exterminator", where the exterminator's real name also was eastland, coincidence? i think not. there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator, among other things, the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a welders-mask when christina sees him for the first time, when he is working on a welding-job on top of a bridge! the other guys in the vietnam-pack are: the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team, frank bruce (michael ironside, total recall, starship troopers), and then there's the doc, dalton, (played by jay patterson, who doesn't look like the guy the imdb is linking to, and i haven't seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there's the cop, gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfying job, he's played by thomas g. waites, who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thing.and in other big roles, we find luis guzmán (boogie nights, carlito's way), as a small-time drug-dealer who can't get a decent job. also, there is dick boccelli as the drug-dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbain-gang, almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat-grinder by john eastland in the exterminator-movie! now, i haven't seen glickenhaus' "shakedown/blue jean cop" yet, but i'm almost ready to bet half a hundred-dollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too! well, back to the plot of this movie.. they go off to colombia and saves the day, yay! but who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action-scenes are very well done, and you're never bored while watching this movie! highly recommended to all action-lovers!

i enjoyed the story by itself, but the things that i learned about wwi planes & boats, make this movie a must see. the close-ups on the plane & the torpedo boat & how they were used were completely new to me. i heartily recommend.

although not one of vonnegut's better known works, it is a definite "must-see". interestingly thought out, i especially like how the director filmed the couple in love.

i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story. the acting by nolte, lee, arkin and the supporting cast was superb. the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details.

vonnegut's words are best experienced on paper. the tales he weaves are gossemar, silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions. his words have been treated well once before, in the remarkable slaughterhouse-5.mother night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island, along with slaughterhouse-5 and bluebeard.the film version deserves a 10, but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just can't do it...some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory...

i am a huge fan of vonnegut's work and i'm very fond of this movie, but i wouldn't say that this is a film of the "mother night" that i read. when people say that vonnegut is unfilmable, two things come to my mind. one is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo, despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively "easy" targets for his satire. this means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned. directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and i have high hopes for the version of "bluebeard" now in production. amazing to think that an innocent piece like vonnegut's "sirens of titan" would probably have been the equivalent of "r" rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s, for its violence, language and sexual and thematic content, though it's a tragedy that nobody's come up yet with a filmable script for it. and in the present economic climate, i also hope some director out there is looking closely at "jailbird", "galapagos" and "hocus pocus".the other thing is his narrative style, heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny. it seems impossible to objectify, and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels, because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like "talkovers". vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work, himself as author/narrator. to its credit, "breakfast of champions" (the movie) tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains. as did another turkey made from a vonnegut novel, "slapstick" in an even more spectacular way.still, there's nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of vonnegut, and "mother night" is an excellent example of how, as another reviewer put it, a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this. but so much of the humour is lost that though it's the same plot, it's not really from the same novel i read. if it had been, i'd probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it. for a reader of the novel, i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable. the end of the film, however, is truly poignant, and i think one of the film's successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that you've watched someone walk a razor's edge between good and evil, and the jury is still out.standing alone and of itself it's well worth a look. technically there are some minor but glaring errors, notably in continuity, and it too often looks drab and theatrical, but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness. the acting in general is of a high order, even if maybe the dialogue is by today's standards a little stilted.it survives quite well watching back to back with "slaughterhouse-5", and there is actually quite a bit more "good" filmed vonnegut out there, mostly versions of his short stories - "harrison bergeron", "who am i this time?" and some other things like, of course, the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play, "happy birthday wanda june". also there was an interesting piece , if it still exists, done in the 70s called "between time and timbuktu" which vonnegut apparently didn't like much, although he was involved in its production, because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality. he said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the hg wells tale "the island of dr. moreau", but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his work.but if the films don't make you want to go to the superior source material, they're not doing their job.as the man said, more or less, the big show is inside your head.

it takes a little while to get used to nick nolte's nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. once you get past the bar, it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good.nolte, an american, moves to germany, marries a famous actress, and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out. he's visited by a jovial american, john goodman, who persuades him to accept a post as an anti-semitic radio broadcaster for the nazis. nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself. another american secret agent will modify nolte's radio scripts -- inserting a cough here, a sneeze there -- that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies. there's a catch, though. nobody will know about nolte's real role as an american agent except goodman, donovan, and roosevelt himself. if he's ever uncovered, he'll be refused recognition by the americans.nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany. his adored wife, sheryl lee, knows nothing of what's going on, nor does she care. nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as "a nation of two." the war ends and the trouble begins. he's captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal. they beat him and leave him in the mud. he's rescued by goodman, his "fairy godmother", who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and then.by 1960, he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor, the painter alan arkin, who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood. but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists -- led by a dentist and a priest. his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. he's beaten senseless by an ex-gi. but -- miraculously -- his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans. another catch: it turns out later that it's not his wife, but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence.the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity. it's not a happy ending.nolte can talk with, but not see, the occupant of the cell above his in jail. it's adolf eichmann. eichmann seems pleasant enough. he advises nolte that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours. "it's important to relax. you must learn to relax." nolte laughs out loud and shouts, "that's how i got here." the film is filled with such ironies. at one point in their relaxed conversations, arkin tells him that "in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart." i don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't, that's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater-goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary.the fact is that it's a movie for adults, and patient adults at that. the story moves slowly, there's very little violence, no car chases, no shootings, and people don't seem subject to manic speech pressure. a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don't open themselves to its deliberate approach. nolte refers to the war-time relationship between him and his wife as "a nation of two." this is a pretty compact phrase. no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import.it's a story of a man who loses everything -- his ability to write, his identity, his wife (twice), his sole friend, his country, his self respect. at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark, when he is moved along by a curious cop. the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go. what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression. i don't mean to sound condescending but it's the sort of feeling that's hard to understand in your youth. adolescents might like to think they know what's holding nolte in that one spot, but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring.remember robert frost's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in? well no place will take nolte in.

i have not read the novel, or anything other by kurt vonnegut, but i am now intending to start. this grips you from the very first frame, and does not let go until the end credits start rolling. taking you places you don't expect, the plot is interesting throughout. the pacing is spot-on, nothing lasts too long, and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen. it is well-told and well-thought out. i've never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to. it is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. the acting is excellent, nolte absolutely shines, goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs, and lee and arkin are spellbinding. i could go on, really... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and all of the visuals are great, with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones. i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. there is one scene of sexuality, and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this. i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it is not pleasant. 8/10

i haven't yet read kurt vonnegut's mother night (though i've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). after seeing keith gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. it's the kind of material that i'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-holocaust/ww2 movies are quite popular. except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say the reader. it's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in ww2 is really all about.it would be one thing if mother night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for howard w. cambpell (nick nolte), which is does. but it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. keith gordon is not someone i usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so i think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with vonnegut himself in back to school), but this is a revelation. he takes the story of campbell as a story of a fractured life: a german propaganda master (the "only american left in berlin"), who is actually a spy for the americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to "a nation of two", himself and his wife (sheryl lee). it follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a new york apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place.mother night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. gordon, by way of vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a "sister" who has come back to him in nyc, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (alan arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. on the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. the 'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. that is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power.but oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: nolte is at his very best here, and sheryl lee, who we might remember from twin peaks as laura palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' helga). it's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). and the music selections rise the level of tragedy. it could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature.it's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of "whoa" as in any spy story. but it's the subversion from vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. i have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post ww2/holocaust storytelling.

i have just recently read the novel "mother night", i've owned the dvd for some time now, and watch it every so often. few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has, i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut, but of the translation of his text to screen.do not rent or watch this movie on vhs, it must be done on dvd, and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film. to see how they took a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and dialogue, and made it work so well, i think any viewer will be amazed.the omissions in the movie are few from the text, and do not detract from it much, the movie might as well be the book, and is the best adaptation i have ever seen. i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch it.it will change you if you do.

the movie is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made. sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really "vonneguty". he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film. not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does.

i've just finished listening to the director's commentary for this film, and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film, like mann's the insider, is completely subjective. it's from howard's pov. so, any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it, as ebert did, is really about nolte's character actually. if you feel, as he did, that the film "does not work", then you're saying, i think, that howard does not work. and, to be frank, you might be right. howard's reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis.but, hey, that's the nature of people.andrew.

nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt vonnegut's dark tale. notle plays howard w. campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during world war ii. after the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past. as with much of vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims. nolte is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)

i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like. however, this being said, he's made a lot of films and i've seen just a few. in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in "the thin red line". nolte has a a full range of acting talents. when it's necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion. his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors: when he just emotes through facial, hand and body gestures, without saying anything. having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors, by and large, have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking, having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin, this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers. of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in. had chaplin lived in our times....who knows, he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools.i have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen. however, the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid, even with all its surprises. of course on the outset it appears preposterous. however, it is also not impossible.consider these for starters: a spy at the heart of the third reich: he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe, america's most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard (look at amazon for more details). consider: history undercover: piercing the reich: american spies inside nazi germany dvd (i saw this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a history channel production.so, is the story ridiculous? far fetched yes, impossible, no. back to the plot. nolte's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts. was it a type of passivity, that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part? that's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp. but, it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things.the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small role.i was really shocked by the ending of the film (no - i won't spoil it) and it made me feel terrible about the choice. did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages? hard to say but it really jolts.nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect....the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things. it's very entertaining and provoking. what great movies should be. a bit long but worth it. by the way, the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers: arvo part.

although i like kurt vonnegut, i'm not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn't know this one. the only reason i watched it was nick nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since i saw "breakfast of champions" and "hotel rwanda". but the film brought me a pleasant surprise. of course nolte was great, but so was the plot. there was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans (and, as it later turns out, americans) towards jews or hitler. which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. howard campbell jr. (nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. there are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song white christmas), that make it real different from average american movies. i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies.

american playwright howard w. campbell, jr. (played with a musty obsolescence by nick nolte) lives happily in germany with his actress wife, helga noth (sheryl lee) before the beginning of world war ii. at the peak of his life, howard is drafted by an american agent (john goodman) to become a spy on behalf of the allies; forewarned of the risks the job holds, howard has everything to lose, but finds the offer irresistible. following the death of his wife and the end of the war, campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in new york city, which muddies his neuroses even further. the central question (indeed, a question that has frustrated many critics) of the movie and kurt vonnegut's source novel is, "is campbell a hero or a traitor?" director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b. weide offer us clues, but no answer, and this ambiguitythis not knowingis what keeps "mother night" fresh and interesting throughout. at the beginning of the film, nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident; by the end, he's either scared and uncertain, or scared and completely certain of his contribution/debt to humanity for the role he played in the war. gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film's first half, which complement his portrait of the nazi bourgeoisie and captures vonnegut's dramatic side. on the flip side, when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment (which he affectionately calls "purgatory") only to be discovered by a group of nazis, the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author, and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds. the moral (even spiritual) paradox "mother night" presents doesn't lend itself to simple resolution, and to a degree, should be left ambiguousthe black-and-white scenes of campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about; the war changes him, coming back to america changes him, and meeting up with the nazis in new york compels him to prolong the facade of his "act" even further, to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall, spewing anti-semitic bile. perhaps that's the best reaction we could hope for.

if you've read mother night and enjoyed it so much (as i did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. does this mean that the movie misses the mark? of course not. in my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. i've seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. i would not place this movie as one of the best i've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. by taking vonnegut's "voice" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, mother night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.

while the movie does feel a bit long at times, it is well worth it. gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles. merciless, thoughtful, ironic, quirky, and dark, this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while, begging for answers to impossible questions. nolte, goodman, and arkin are all incredible. sheryl lee is wonderful as well, in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura/maddy days. do not miss this one!

mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment. instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elequence, and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut's novel.this is certainly nolte's best preformance to date. he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes.alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft. sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambell's young lover. john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambell's "blue fairy godmother."this pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people. and aside from that, it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across. cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish. and he realizes that...well, watch the movie and you'll see.mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.

before this, the flawed "slaughterhouse five" was the best. but this screen adaptation of "mother night" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent. thankfully it wasn't hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of "breakfast of champions." another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as i think you do for slaughterhouse five). that's probably true of breakfast of champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! nick nolte did an excellent job in this film.

hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller? mother night is a very good vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. the "indie" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it. these days, i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses. and normally that is too bad, but not in this case. mother night has tight direction and a solid cast. nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that "everyman" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always. i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. i guess making your debut as a dead girl (twin peaks)with little air time isn't the choicest of roles, even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon. anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. in fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (i am talking to you, fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!).

there are numerous films relating to ww2, but mother night is quite distinctive among them: in this film, we are introduced to howard campbell (nolte), an american living in berlin and married to a german, helga noth (lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy: more specifically, a cia agent major wirtanen (goodman) recruits campbell who becomes a nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the hitler regime. however, the deal is that the us government will never acknowledge campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, and so campbell becomes a hated figure across the us. after the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but the past comes back and haunts him. his only "friend" is wirtanen, but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor campbell...the story is deeply touching, as we watch the tragedy of campbell who although a great patriot, is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him. not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him, have many secrets of their own. vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, with campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer.nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in "affliction", although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction. sheryl lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.i haven't read the book, so i cannot appraise how the film compares to it. in any case, this is something of no importance here: my critique is upon the film per se, and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9/10.

at first, i hadn't read the novel so far and i hadn't hear anything about the author yet. but as i casually saw this movie, i was totally captive by the story. already as the jewish watchman primary said, that he knows no one, who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w. campbell junior, was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war. terrific! and the fictitious story about "the most effective spy for the usa in wwii", who have lost everything, that was important for his life, is wonderful emotional transcribed. this is the best story about the duality of humanity, i've ever heard about! the questions, this movie is introducing, are in my opinion very important for our society: when does someone bear the guilt of something? what is guilt? who is a hero and who is a felon? what is important in our life? can you live without paying attention to the political changes? is the protagonist guilty or not? these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years. this is a must see for everyone, who have to think about the acception of war! this movie is a must see for everyone, who meditate, what matters in life and what doesn't...

i haven't yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from, but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen. overall, i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonnegut's novels. it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is recruited as a spy for the us. his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazi's and send secret messages to the american's via his weekly radio show. but when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york, where various odd plot twists await.if mother night has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times. but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb. and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell. very much recommended.

this is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. i am very impressed at the film, not just for the plot and superb acting, but that such a unique movie was made. most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking brit or a mighty battle, but not this. this isn't about this kind of war, its about the war between a man and his position in life, an american spy in germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. when the war is over, campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. going back to america, campell meets nazi supporters as well as nazi haters, providing for interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking.

i haven't read this book, but all through the movie i was awestruck with only one thought in my head: this is so vonnegut. i have never seen an author, all of the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel, translated so well to film. this movie had the same complexities found in vonnegut's novels: the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokes.campbell was also a very vonnegut character, portrayed perfectly by nick nolte. he had all of the earmarks of a vonnegut "hero": lack of concern for political boundaries, ironic dark humor giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress, and an unwillingness to push his version of reality on those around him.overall, i was constantly surprised and impressed as i watched this movie. it was the same feeling i had reading "cat's cradle," my first vonnegut novel, as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen, he thought of that, and he made it real and important. yes, he has nothing but army surplus "white christmas" albums. so it goes!

the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published. nolte takes the role of howard w. campbell, jr., and makes it his own, remaining true to vonnegut's depiction of a man who has lost all (to and) for love.no weaknesses in this fine adaptation.

this movie pleasantly surprised me. it has a touching, slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. this is a movie i never heard about, but if you want a "sleeper", this is it. great writing, production, and acting. i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful. nick nolte, sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous. why wasn't more made of this movie?

it's so rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves, but not by much. as a long-time student of vonnegut's works, i have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers, at least to those that love him as i do. the casting is inspired: nolte is understated in triumph, bewildered in defeat, decisive in judgment. sheryl lee is luscious throughout, but her handling of the treacherous resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty. alan arkin delivers a totally lovable, but equally treacherous, soviet spy.do not feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film; though, if you haven't read mother night, you will probably want to after viewing the film.notice the shifts from color to black-and-white and back again, and don't miss the final symbolism of campbell's noose. watch, also, for kurt vonnegut's cameo near the end of the film.bing crosby's "white christmas" will never sound the same (i write in mid-december, when the song is getting heavy radio play, and it's driving me nuts).

i'm a rather pedestrian person, with somewhat lowbrow tastes. however, i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness. this movie was one of my attempts. i was in awe throughout the entire movie. i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again. this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. i saw it as a huge question to the viewer: what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept, can be asked to accept, should accept? as a military member, this is of course an important question to me. this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie.recommended.

as alan rudolph's "breakfast of champions" slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon's "mother night" came out. now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being "unfilmable" it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments (the other being "slaughter-house five"). "mother night" is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why. it's brilliant! it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut's book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? not only is it a beautiful film, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s. it's a mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. i would sincerely encourage anyone to see "mother night" - it doesn't even take a familiarity with vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as "slaughter-house five" sometimes does). it is a powerful, affecting piece of cinema.

at the height of the 'celebrity big brother' racism row in 2007 ( involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody ), i condemned on an internet forum those 'c.b.b.' fans who praised the show, after years of bashing 'racist' '70's sitcoms such as 'curry & chips' & 'love thy neighbour'. i thought they were being hypocritical, and said so. 'it ain't half hot mum' was then thrown into the argument, with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blacked-up. well, yes, but michael bates had lived in india as a boy, and spoke urdu fluently. the show's detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer 'rangi ram'. the noted indian character actor, renu setna, said in a 1995 documentary 'perry & croft: the sitcoms' that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role, but added: "no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates.". indeed.'mum' was perry and croft's companion show to 'dad's army'; also set in wartime, the sedate english town of walmington-on-sea had been replaced by the hot, steamy jungles of india, in particularly a place called deolali, where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops, among them bombadier solomons ( george layton, his first sitcom role since 'doctor in charge' ), camp gunner 'gloria' beaumont ( melvyn hayes ), diminutive gunner 'lofty' sugden, 'lah de-dah' gunner graham ( john clegg ), and gunner parkins ( the late christopher mitchell ). presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeant-major williams ( the brilliant windsor davies ), who regarded them all as 'poofs'. his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he was nice to parkins, whom he thought was his illegitimate son! ). then there was ever-so english colonel reynolds ( donald hewlett ) and dimwitted captain ashwood ( michael knowles ). rangi was like a wise old sage, beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs. he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british. his friends were the tea-making char wallah ( the late dino shafeek, who went on to 'mind your language' ) and the rope pulling punka wallah ( babar bhatti ). so real indians featured in the show - another point its detractors ignore. shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as 'vocal interruptions' ( similar to the '40's songs used as incidental music on 'dad's army' ). each edition closed with him warbling 'land of hope & glory' only to be silenced by a 'shut up!' from williams. the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek taverner.though never quite equalling 'dad's army' in the public's affections, 'mum' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons. in 1975, davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut 'whispering grass'. they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts, entitled ( what else? ) 'sing lofty!'.the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer. rather than recast the role of 'rangi', the writers just let him be quietly forgotten. when george layton left, the character of 'gloria' took his place as 'bombadier', providing another source of comedy.the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty, the char wallah watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers ).repeats have been few and far between ( mainly on u.k. gold ) all because of its so-called 'dodgy' reputation. this is strange. for one thing, the show was not specifically about racism. if a white man blacked-up is so wrong, why does david lean's 1984 film 'a passage to india' still get shown on television? ( it featured alec guinness as an indian, and won two oscars! ). it was derived from jimmy perry's own experiences. some characters were based on real people ( the sergeant-major really did refer to his men as 'poofs' ). i take the view that if you are going to put history on television, get it right. sanitizing the past, no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences, is fundamentally dishonest. 'mum' was both funny and truthful, and viewers saw this. thank heavens for d.v.d.'s i say. time to stop this review. as williams would say: "i'll have no gossiping in this jungle!"

this wartime sitcom written by jimmy perry and david croft, who wrote tv's best programme ever dads army, was not as good as dads army, but still very, very funny.it is about a concert band in india. most episodes were about bsm williams (windsor davies) trying to get the concert party, who he referred to as a bunch of puffs, posted up the jungle. he was always unsuccessful as the vague colonel reynolds (donald hewlett) and the stupid captain ashwood (michael knowles) were big fans of the concert party. the concert party consisted of bombadier solomans (george layton), ginger rogers impersonator gunner "gloria" beaumont (melvyn hayes), university educated piano player gunner "la de da" gunner graham, a.k.a padarouski (john clegg), singer gunner "lofty" sugden, gunner parkins (christopher mitchell) (williams thought parkins was his son, he was quite wrong), big eater gunner "nosher" evans and animal impersonator's (kenneth macdonald), he was no percy edwards. also, heavily involved in the adventures were faithful indian servant rangi ram (michael bates), with the char-wallah and the punkah-wallah (dino shafeek and babar bhatti) giving ram wonderful support. the show, just like dads army left many catchphrases. rangi ram used to say to his punkah wallah "don't be such clever dickie" and he ended a lot of the shows saying "here is a very old hindu proverb e.g when wife is having affair with best friend, it doesn't stop your house from catching fire" it was williams though who had the most catchphrases. he would always shout "shuddup!!!!!", say "oh dear, how sad, never mind" and when talking to gunner graham, he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent.this show doesn't enjoy the same recognition as dads army did. this is probably due to a question of taste: this is seen as being crude. williams is homophobic calling his men "puffs", though it has to be said williams is a bore. also, some people think there is a racial element in the humour, using the fact that michael bates was blacked up to play rangi ram (bates was actually born in india though and spoke urdu before he spoke english), so the bbc will feel a bit uneasy putting it on, even though the vast majority of people who have actually watched the show would agree that the show isn't racist, i know someone who is half indian, and they weren't the slightest bit offended and agreed like i did that it was a very funny show. when i see an episode for the first time, i laugh probably more than i do for any other sitcom, but when i see it second time round, i don't laugh all that much, but no matter how many times i see dads army, i laugh many times in an episode.best episode: the road to banu, series 1, episode 7

evidently, not many people have seen this movie, because no one is posting any more comments. this is not a movie to be missed. after all, it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award. paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie. eugene logan who was a co-writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity, or loss of it, by being a technical adviser to truman capote's movie the glass house. this movie is now available on dvd. if anyone is interested, i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote. thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies.

green eyes is a great movie. in todays context of supporting our troops, it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty, during this period. from a historical view, the end of the vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from. gene was very proud of this movie, and he deserved the credits he received from writing "green eyes". i agree, i do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or at all. this movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on tv every year, much like the wizard of oz. the dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving. i was a friend of gene logans and i was proud to know him. rocky

truly this is a 'heart-warming' film. it won the george peobody award, winning over "roots", so that may tell you something of the essence of this film. i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law, eugene logan, the co-writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. i would love to have his only grand-daughters, my daughters, see this film, as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great-grandsons. my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again. one of my friends said it was her favorite movie. i won't 'spoil' this movie for you.

i really can't say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn't already been said. i haven't seen the movie in about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me. i have been searching for it every where. i have done net searches for it in the past but came up empty. last night i was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but i was only about 10 or 12 when i last saw it and i wasn't even sure if i had the right movie name so i decided to do another search and i finally found this sight. i was right. if any one knows where i can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com i would really appreciate it. and to anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to it is well worth it.

i don't know what it is i find so endearing about this film, but the first time i saw it, i wanted to see how it ended. i'm not a big fan of paul winfield nor of war-dramas, but i was truly wondering just how and when winfield would find his child. all he knows is that the boy has green eyes. truth be told, i have not seen this movie in years nor has it been shown on tv in a while, but this movie is somewhat of one man's odyssey after the pains of war. winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories. there is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he does confront. why this movie is not yet on dvd or video is a mystery to me.

no movies have grabbed my attention like this one has. you see, i have wanted to watch this movie again for over twenty-five years. the one and only time i saw it was as a teen-ager which may have been the year it was released, 1977.what i do remember of the movie is that it touched those deep-held emotions so profoundly that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again. the intrigue this movie provides by the human element of father/son seeking and searching is sure to touch every human soul who watches it. why this movie has not been brought out of storage and shown as often as many other movies of lesser depth, i do not know.postscript: received copy of movie and after watching it again was delighted to see that my memory held true. rating reflects movie content. would like to watch this movie on dvd as seeing this 1977 production on a used vhs tape took away from the overall quality.

the hip hop rendition of a mos def performance (according to the film's musical credits)...it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each "snap" if anyone can tell me someplace this song, "live wire snap" by mos def from "the ground truth", an undeniable duty to see as the americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of purpose...they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry..."live wire snap" by mos def, where can it be founddesperate to find it :medically unable to serve

having just "welcomed home" my 23 yr old daughter from a year in iraq, camp anaconda medical support unit, i felt compelled to get this dvd. i wanted to hear other returning vets feelings in order to attempt to better understand her mentality on arrival and not waiting until after something bad happened. regardless on your take on the war and peace this movie serves as a great start for all americans to begin the healing of our returning vets emotional void. the paramount statement of the entire movie is "take action" on the problem . incredibly emotional movie. i would highly recommend this movie to the vet the vets entire mature family and ask that they follow through with a plan to listen comfort help the returning gulf war enduring freedom vets.fast forward nearly one year later & my daughter has seen this dvd. took account of her emotions and actually has made a commitment to re-up for another 6 years. her take on her time spent in the sand is that she did some good. local balad children got first rate medical treatment for various common ailments not ordinarily able to afford free with an escort and translator. her look over her shoulder at her iraq tour was . "we changed some hearts and minds back there" great dvd you have to keep an open mind and see all sides

this movie is a must-see movie for all. congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier, as should everyone in america. the previous reviewer totally missed the point--the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but who just live in our "enemy's" territory, and what it does to the soldiers. we must support our troops by bringing them home immediately, before another person is killed or injured. this also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are injured mentally, with ptsd- post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. julie a. roberts, streamwood, il

this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum. it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq, god rest the souls of the 350,000 plus that have been killed, had anything to do with terrorism nor al-quida.following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of "loose change." this movie is available free on the internet, until the bush cabal locks it down, by googling-up the very title, as indicated in parenthesis.god save our country. this will not be done by following the christo-fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over 10 years prior to november, 2006!

i desperately need this on a tape, not a dvd, and soon!i have one nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet deployed, although he set to go to iraq soon after december 2008. i lost my beloved step son in ramadi iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone. i have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has some idealized and romanticized idea about what serving in the military is. my stepson died after only 10 days in country and he never went out on any missions so my nephews have no way to reference any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary from any type of personal experiences that might have been conveyed by my now deceased son. there is nothing i can do about those who are in, or now gone, but i have one left that has not raised his hand and been sworn in yet. i desperately want him to do so informed, none of the others did.pleases help me with this.the movie documentary the ground truth is the best visual reference i have ever seen. i need to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he is getting himself into before it is to late. but: ( do not laugh )i need my mother to see this first. she must actually see and hear these men and women, not simply the idea of them, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this film and once he has then he may then make his son, my youngest nephew, watch it too. then, my nephew might begin to take this seriously. ((( is there another time when this will be shown on tv ? if so please tell me when ? )))however, my problem is, my mother does not own a dvd player, she still uses video ( is that correct? with tapes ? ) so, i need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film. can i purchase this from anyone in that form? if not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from anyone? is there any legitimate link from which i can pay to download it onto my computer and then transfer it to a tape. if so who would i contact. i will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link. or,if you have any alternative ideas i will consider anything you can suggest.please help me, i have lost one very precious adored and loved one already, i already know my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and i may loose him too. i cannot loose three and the emotional toll for all of those that do make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. please help me. i will happily call you, email me a number if that is the best way to get the needed information. thank you so much for any help you can offer.sincerely, lori swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com

do not expect a depiction of the "truth". however, the accounts of these veterans of the iraqi & afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration. the major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives. my major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and veterans affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war. these are not fatal flaws of the film.as a veteran myself, i know that the horrible aftermath of war is real, and these young men and women articulate it very well. these vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.

the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately. the walter reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return.what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars. the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life. they are not just changed or affected, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves.finally, this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma.we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war. it doesn't matter what side you are on, it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business. this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly.

there is an episode of the simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a "killbot factory". here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke, but what patricia foulkrod's documentary does is show us, scarily, that it is not that far from the truth. after world war two the us army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war; that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of 'me or them'. since then the training process of the us army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who don't think of combatants as people. to develop in them a most unnatural state: "the sustainable urge to kill".first off, this isn't an antiwar movie as such. whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light, foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that doesn't get as much media attention as, say, the debate over the legality of a war or it's physical successes or failures; the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being. it's the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves, and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current middle east conflict foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts, especially vietnam, painfully clear. this isn't about any particular war, it's about the problems caused by war in general.structurally the film seems to be split into three sections; how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive, how they are treated once they are in combat, and what happens once they leave the army. once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced, policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals. those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple, how word like "democracy" and "freedom" are banded around, but once the training begins they become "enemy" and "kill" and "destroy". how once in action soldiers don't care what they are ordered to do, as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order, whatever it may be, they are one step closer to going home. they have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as that's what they've been trained to do.but the ground truth's main goal is to highlight the way the us army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home. there is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning, and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done, and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up. this is the final indignity, that once they are used they are cast away.if there is a flaw in the film it is that foulkrod doesn't attempt to show another side to the argument. you would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with post traumatic stress syndrome. it would have been interesting to see those of a less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies. there is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself known.but other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary, and foulkrod's use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war.

that is no criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past. i recently watched winter soldier, and the ground truth was like watching a remake or sequel-- except it was about iraq rather than vietnam. similar to winter soldier because of it's one-sided message, both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering. both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines, but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for. this is ultimately what lost the war in vietnam, and will likely lose the war in iraq as well. my only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided it could be easily passed off as left- wing propaganda. not by me, mind you, but by those aiming to discredit the film and message. a more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience.

this film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. for many soldiers, men and women alike, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. i am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from wwii. for one of my uncles the war was never over. he survived the d-day invasion, something akin to the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan. for him the memories not only lingered but tortured him. he became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins, his sons. jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. when i saw this at the kc filmfest, i was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change. the idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in iraq, and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right.the tag line from the vietnam war film platoon says it all. "the first casualty of war is innocence."

i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine. i didn't know what to expect, i'd not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what. all in all, it is very well done. it doesn't focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which to me, left the politics out of it. the soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp, and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life. it was really good to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war, but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals. make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls.

i saw this film premiere friday (1/19) night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved. sitting in a theater and hearing first-hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear. others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away, the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us. robert acosta, paul rieckhoff, sean huze, and herold noel, all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film, were present. while they may be home now, you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be. whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. see this film!

i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has. it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it. the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into "killers for their country" and put into the war and the after effects once they return home. it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche. it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films, instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vets.this film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought provoking. it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them, and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing ends.the best film of the festival so far, ****/****

this was a good movie. it wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different. this movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war. this film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made. colin farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and clifton collins jr and also matthew davis contributed reasonably well. seeing colin farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years, you would never thought it would happen. i will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch. its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future.

just caught it at the toronto international film festival. this is a good story, told in a compelling way. the handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes (in a documentary style, not a blair witch style). joel schumacher shows he doesn't need a big budget to produce a gripping film.the actors were strong, particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film, boz.

joel schumacher made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script. the story is well written and well laid out, and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. it seemed that there were 6 "leads" and about a half dozen supporting, and by far this is the best thing about the movie, the fresh young faces of tomorrow. it has been a long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films,which says something for the"story that needed to be told"(as stated by schumacher) and tigerland lands in that handful of top war movies period. yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of bozz and the others. i think anyone who just wants to see a good film with out all of the special fx, but just good, gritty drama should go see tigerland, obviously shumachers best works in the past 8 years.

this was one of the best war movies i've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war. all of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable. the camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing. this movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters.

first of all i saw this movie without knowing anything about it i just knew that joel schumacher did it and that was enough for me. a friend and i went to see it at a danish film festival called the night-film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that wouldn't otherwise be shown in danish theaters.anyway my friend and i went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings, we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book.the film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the danish initiative "dogma 95" which was started by 4 danish directors including lars von trier (dancer in the dark).in conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the american g.i. joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home.also colin farrell is exceptional in this movie i haven't seen him before but i can't wait to see more of him.lars p. helvard

there's an inexhaustible hunger for "basic training" movies, so it's surprising that this one got so little notice when first released. looks likely to have a well-deserved second life on dvd/vhs.tigerland isn't uniformly great by any means, there are some terribly cliched characters (especially the portrayal of the nco's, makes you long for the return of lee 'full metal jacket' ermey) but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom. charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get.

tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in vietnam in 1971.at this point, america knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'tigerland' training camp in louisiana.the film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character roland boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. we are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.i'd have to say this is a great story about vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. great acting, and very memorable. also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding vietnam. its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. the particular scene where boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility.fantastic film. not just about nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.rating 9 out of 10.

there are four great movie depicting the vietnam war. they are (in no particular order: apocalypse now, born on the fourth of july, platoon, and finally tigerland. all but tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the vietnam war. the character of boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. this has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. also, this is a very complex character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. the character of boz makes this movie so good. it is a shame it did not get a major release. it belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.

i wasn't expecting the highest calibre of film-making with joel schumacher directing this one, so i was surprised that tigerland wasn't a complete waste of time.in technique, it's often derivative of saving private ryan with the shaky camera work, grainy shots, the film occasionally running like it's skipping a sprocket---all those techniques speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else.but unlike saving private ryan, the emotional component wasn't as weak, as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived, not so wrapped up in the american flag (speilberg gets an 'f' in subtlety).next to the first section of kubrick's full metal jacket, this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that i have seen in a film, and for that i think it's worth watching.it's not a great film, but neither is it a bad film.

tigerland is one of the finest films that i have seen, and in my opinion it outdoes even full metal jacket, a film of similar nature. bozz is played exceptionally well by farrell, and is a character who stays in your mind long after the film ends. the ending is brilliantly cut by schumacher - with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave. what a film.

never heard of this movie,saw it on dvd.great movie,perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work.no overhyped typical hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.no current quote "a" list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.brought back memories of my own post vietnam war military experiences.it concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.as was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service.they were regular people too,some just weren't cut out for military life,i remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but i'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.i highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in afganistan.basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need "sensitivity training" ha!ha!ha!

while i suppose this film could get the rap as being anti-vietnam, while watching it i didn't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didn't support.... it showed their fear, their desperation, their drive... all of it, out in the open, naked. as a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp. on the whole this movie, although it was shot on a very small budget, looks great, is very well put together, and features excellent acting and directing. i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film. 10/10

if you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it, then tigerland is the film for you. i love this movie from top to bottom. this movie's picture-perfect scenes look so real; it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama. boy, i tell you... real drama they actually real "fought" in one of the scenes (get the dvd listen to the commentary its not obvious). i see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill-fated destiny, after watching saving private ryan i have an a appreciation of what an "ill-fated destiny" is and know exactly how the men in the film feel. i see this movie as a crossbreed between "stand by me" and "saving private ryan." what do men do when they are with a situation that's "hard pressed" in real life? some men go crazy, some men cry, some men through fists, others do drugs, some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life, some try drink the pain away, some jump off buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse - physically. this movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball. but don't get me wrong its not depressing movie, its realistic, its a very very humorous movie, the cocky and funny bozz (collin's character) lights it all up, and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie; i'll let you figure out what their in there for! with dialogue, war/action sequences, picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music; this movie has it all, like i said: from top to bottom. i don't why tigerland is heavily under-credited. the best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing "the best film of the year," and it absolutely falls nothing short of that. keep the rare gems coming hollywood, 10/10.

to me this was colin farrells best movie evr! he introduced himself to america through this movie and he was great. he really got you into his charictor and made u feel the passion he was putting into his role. in my opinion it is a great movie and my favorite.

producer joel schumacher who also directed "phone booth",'02, and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat!! colin farrell(roland bozz),"intermission",'03, gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back. matthew davis(jim paxton),"blue crush",'02, gave a great supporting role and shea whigham(pvt.wilson),"all the real girls",'03, showed his true acting skills in the role that he played. there was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. one army veteran instructor from viet nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. enjoyable and entertaining film to view.

i had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back. so when i saw part of this movie one night on a pay-for-view channel i was intrigued. i wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for vietnam. i went out and rented this movie and i have to say it is the most heart-wrenching film i have ever seen. i bought the dvd immediately after renting it. the way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something i've never experienced with any other film. as far as vietnam subject films go, i think it is the best one, although platoon runs a close second. besides all of that, i think it is also colin farrell's best performance as an actor. i like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible. i gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies.

the dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. joel schumacher's 'tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, vietnam). but 'tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named bozz (played outstandingly well by colin farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves america (whereas stanley kubrick's 'full metal jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to asia). although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that i've seen, and among the very best of its genre.

really touching story of a recruitment camp in america, where young men are prepared for the vietnam war. the human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies, because it translates personal, subjective opinions on war, opposed war action movies where action, and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. the movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. the movie focuses on the tragic character of bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in, spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. perfect irony.the acting is truly exceptional, and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts, hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted.

in joel schumacher, you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time. but this is common knowledge; i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur. hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror/thriller; chaplin liked his comedy; scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and spielberg likes his large scale, big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids. other more obscure examples include kubrick and welles who covered too much to write about here.but schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise. falling down had a great idea behind it but i found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy. batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. then comes 8mm; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before tigerland which is schumacher's best film from what i've so far seen, in my opinion. with the war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. i can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the d-day landings during saving private ryan: at the time when i first saw the film, i had not much knowledge of the second world war bar when it began and finished. my eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'i can't believe it smile' on my face. needless to say, it was because of that film i searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole. in tigerland, you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through bozz (farrell), a tough and egotistical soldier training for the vietnam war.but what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time. the things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school. tigerland may borrow from full metal jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the vietnam war but egos and superegos play more of a part here, i think. the superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against bozz whose ego is extremely large. there is also the third part of freud's triangle that sneaks into bozz: the id. compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos, bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself: "you are all dead in this situation!" barks a sergeant. "any questions?" "yeah, if i'm dead how come i can ask a question?" replies bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true id style; that is he enjoys the punishments.also regarding the superegos, bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training. this is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell bozz he is in charge. what follows is an actual conversation between bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his christian name. this is where private wilson's (whigham) character steps in: his uncontrollable rage and anger at bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river. wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward bozz and acts out.what i also liked about tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave. while lacking in innovation, tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look. make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness. but, we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for tv; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but schumacher is clever: he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was. it's worth saying here that spielberg said he wanted saving private ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.while being very funny and entertaining, tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute. its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier. there are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy, if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military.

first off, this movie was a wild ride the whole way. the story of the training of the soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and in the end grouping together.from the very beginning to the very end. this is one war drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing (at times beyond reason) and the horrors of what boot camp are.the dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times, and sometimes humorous. how bozz (colin farrel) deals with paxton (matthew davis) throughout the storyline, from camp to tigerland, and even in the end helping him.the innovative free-hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film. constant moving, constant action, and just constant confusion. at times, it was a help. others, not so much.throughout the film, it was increasingly realistic. some points in the film (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldn't have been there without them. it was a very gritty movie, through and through.in my opinion, this is one of colin farrel's better movies (if not his top performance). the acting for every character was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r

tigerland / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)by blake french:	throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield. joel schumacher ("8mm," "a time to kill"), easily one of the riskiest directors currently working, has found resemblance with "the thin red line" in the way his new drama "tigerland" steps in an individual soldier's shoes. this movie, written by ross klavan and michael mcguther, has more guts and irony than "the thin red line" or even "saving private ryan." although the movie's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present, it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war. 	i would want to know joel schumacher's experiences with the army. are the men really this unabashed and brutal? i am sure some of them are, but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named roland bozz (colin farrell), who is rebellious against the ideas of war. his personality instantly counteracts with several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, paxton (matthew davis), and another, wilson (russell richardson), whose flamed temper often exasperates bozz's tension with the idea of going to war. the war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield, but on training grounds of a louisiana-based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training. this film is specifically about the preparation for war, nothing more nothing less. it ends when the soldiers finally go to war, kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff.  shot on location in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a minuscule budget, joel schumacher accurately displays a gritty, perverse, cruel, and unmerciful atmosphere using hand-held cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. schumacher's grainy and blown-out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature. this unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie, quite graphic in its use of coarse language, perhaps a little too disturbing. waves of four-letter words pound the audience, some in shock of what they are hearing. even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking, true, and emotional.	if anything, "tigerland" provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat. such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war, knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken. such thought-provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees. this movie is not for all audiences, but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army...and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such. 

i really like this movie. bozz is an ultra-cool, not to be intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war. his persona is similar in a way to yossarian in catch-22, joseph heller's classic novel about men and war. this film, however, is not set in a war zone, but in a pre-war combat prep training. this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization that the vietnam war was a mistake and those men who were pegged to be sacrificed for a losing cause.colin farrell is brilliant as bozz, a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did disdain and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him. bozz is totally cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking his military superiors, getting their goat at every opportunity. he is a jesus christ figure with a psychology degree, "saving" his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need, the way out of this man's army.the acting and action is crisp and believable and as a "sleeper", tigerland goes down with apocalypse now and full metal jacket as one of the top three vietnam films in my opinion.five stars, a top pick.

while it was filmed at a florida national guard site, "tigerland" totally reminded me of fort polk, la., firing ranges, maneuver areas, waist-deep water and all. the movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my ait in 1974. the difference between the tigerland year, 1971, and mine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they weren't going back to vietnam, as it was pretty much all over, so training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. that was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s, which i know for a fact as i stayed in until 2004. i never heard anyone mention "tigerland" but the army did have realistic vietnam training villages at different bases across the u.s. vietnam vets tell me that up to 1972 basic & ait could be pretty rough and rugged, because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train vietnam-bound men those skills to make it, although that was not always the case. both a drill sergeant at polk and later one of my vietnam vet ncos, when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at fort bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves. this movie rates high.

war drama that takes place in louisiana in 1971. it follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then tigerland--an accurate portrayal of vietnam on american soil, before they're shipped over. it focuses on two men--booz (colin farrell) and paxton (matthew davis)...how they meet, become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader (clifton collins jr.) and a borderline psycho (shea wingham).a surprisingly non-commercial film directed by joel schumacher. he uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes. it works very well--the film looks gritty (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic.farrell successfully covers up his irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing southern accent. his performance is just superb--he's an extremely talented young man. davis, unfortunately, is not that good. he's tall, muscular, very handsome--and very bland. the rest of the cast however is just great.this film was thrown away by its studio. it had no stars in it, a familar story and was considered "just another war film". it only played a week in boston! it's well worth catching on video or dvd.also, farrell and davis have a lengthy nude scene.

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but it is nothing new.everyone here is grouping it with other war movies, this movie has been miscategorized! its not a war movie any more than "one flew over the cuckoos nest" is a asylum movie or "cool hand luke" is a prison movie. this is a movie about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the costs of that personality type.the plot is the same as "one flew over the cuckoos nest" and "cool hand luke", its in good company, and it holds its own. its these movies it should be held up against and compared, not "apocalypse now" or "platoon".eric

i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s. it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation. i'm not sure that squares with the facts.still the film is well done. the german high command reports wryly without emotion "the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse" as if all went according to plan.it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler. i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper.i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic. the american knock-off was a little flat.few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph. yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece.was gibs?

i remember this film from many years ago. certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact. it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier. but they were nonetheless very powerful.this subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years. and it was most effectively treated here, with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism.i wish it would be shown on tv at least once. or at least be available on tape or dvd. or is it? is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it??

made only ten years after the actual events, and set in the bunker under the reichstag, pabst's film is wholly gripping. it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war. haven't seen this in over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave. searing bit of dialog between two generals: "does god exist?" "if he did, we wouldn't." shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge, "im toten winkel" {aka "blind spot: hitler's secretary") and "downfall" with bruno ganz.

this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years. not pompous like the british, not gung-ho like the americans. if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did, it would have failed dismally. either due to ignorance on the british part, or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side. "true" australians (i.e. non-imports) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives. just look at examples like gallipoli; paschendale; tobruk; new guinea and vietnam.

this is the story of australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid. since they are out of uniform, they are, justly, treated as spies. as such, they are tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. the japanese court-martial, out of admiration for their heroism, authorizes that they be given a warrior's death. of course, under the code of bushido, this means that they are to be beheaded. a fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared.

i was overtaken by the emotion. unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people. the performances were faultless and outstanding.

it's been so long since i've seen this movie (at least 15 years) and yet it still haunts me with a vivid image of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the geneva convention.a unit of australian underwater demolitions experts are captured in an archipelago near japan following a successful mission to set mines in a japanese harbor.once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other pows but to their dismay soon learn from a friendly japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when captured. the consequences of such an infraction, by japanese martial code, is execution by beheading.despite their pleas, and the pleas of the sympathetic prison guard, the day of reckoning approaches like a ticking time bomb. the tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking, though it may just be your chest pounding with the percussion of a marching execution squad.the ending is actually too painful to reenact in my head much less write it here. but i can promise you-- you'll never forget it. good luck finding the video in the u.s.

i saw this australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over. the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside. if you can find any type of copy of this--buy or rent it. you won't be disappointed, just awed.

i had seen this movie long time back, but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me.a wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of australian commandos who tried to sink some japanese ships at the singapore harbor during the height of ww2.these commandos are caught in plain-clothes and they are considered to be spies by the japanese captors. but something happens that hasn't been explored much in any hollywood ww2 movie that i have seen.a close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives. they begin to respect each other, while the captain of the captured australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior japanese prison guard. this is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart.soon, one day as the two friends are conversing, the aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the jap ships in the singapore harbor.he mentions that it was his team and not some other's that had sunk the ships to his japanese friend, and upon hearing this the japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed. but the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the japanese authorities.finally, the japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules. this is the highest honor accorded to the captured warriors in japan.this is the most awesome part of the film where the aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his aussie friend confess being guilty.i won't give away the ending here. but it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears.all in all, an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn't get the recognition that it deserved internationally. get one copy today and be mesmerized.

some war movies succeed where others do not, and that can be judged from a variety of angles. the humanistic angle, one where you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack, the camaraderie amongst soldiers, the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat, etc..) are always movies i find compelling. movies like das boot and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film.this film succeeds on that level as well. it speaks of "the highest honor" and that honor is doing the right thing. these 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with western thought, but it is, to the very end, a true story of honor. unforgettable movie. based on the true story.

in the process of trying to establish the audiences' empathy with jake roedel (tobey maguire) the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers. missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force. the southerners fought for state's rights: the right to own slaves, elect crooked legislatures and judges, and employ a political spoils system. there's nothing noble in that. the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate army.it seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. when jake leaves the bushwhackers, it's not because he saw error in his way, he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition.

you're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. i rated the audie murphy movie a 3 (i'm a harsh grader), the second lowest i ever gave audie (the worst being "battle at bloody beach" if you're curious). i give this movie a rating of "8" (and i'm a harsh grader) it's the civil war story of renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the north. people like quantrell, and the men who rode with these outlaws.the original was a watery version, very clean cut, while still depicting the horror of what these men did. actually, movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences, who can discern the story. i would be more apt to rate the original "r" and this one, with it's gruff nature, a gp, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version.film makers since the early sixties have boasted about "realism", but few of them deliver. instead, they just give the drab scenery, drab costumes, and drab events, but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters, the weakness of the spaghetti era.modern film makers have realized this mistake. it is evident in a superior style of western we usually see today. this movie is an example. it gives the realistic settings, but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era.it has a few lulls, which makes a complete sit through a bit hard, and it has some unexplained situations. but unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up, and the characters are intriguing enough.it begins a bit campy, but really improves. the main character is one we can identify, and at least have some sympathy for. the audie murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy, and is too self righteous without motivation.the character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti-hero. there is motivation, and a method to his madness. we never feel he is truly "right", but we can understand where he comes from.there is plenty of action in the movie. there is also some humor. one good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldn't lie to him, and he mulls that over.this movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades. this director and writer team got it right.recommended. complete success.

i enjoyed this film very much.tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake. he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen. and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before. the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all. i did not know what to expect from jewel's performance but i think she did rather well. lots of exciting scenes. a thoroughly good ride. i am absolutely a fan of maguire's. check out cider house rules. one of the all time best ever.

ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film, to catch action, characters and setting on the hoof, as they emerge. covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia, unformed in mind or manhood, this is an ideal approach. the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid-south as a silent character, enduring the strife like a hardy parent.james schamus' script is probably the standard bearer for this film; close behind it are a number of well-appointed performances that carry it admirably. jeffrey wright's name alone could carry this film for me. he's brilliant here but in a slow burning role: instead we are treated to very good (if not revelatory) performances from a large, often recognisable ensemble.a noble, optimistic film. one to watch if you don't fancy the harder, more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim, for example. 7/10

so, neighbor was killing neighbor. reminds me of iraq. as i watched the american flag (50 stars in 1864?) being dragged behind the horse, i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the bill of rights. i'm a southerner, and must have some historical memory.watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans (his ethnic background) being wagered at a poker game.....was interesting. many twists in this movie. the wife, who is forced into her marriage, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics we're not used to seeing in 'respectable victorian southern belles'.the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the copeland horse-thieving gang, inc. in mississippi, was hung about that time. bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside, armed. remind you of iraq? and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background? and why southerners are still fighting that civil war today.too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just invaded and are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. that's mesopotamia, now called iraq, who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil. the wild-eyed killers in missouri, raiding lawrence, kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success.another anomaly was the father's tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school "even before they erect a church. and for that reason, they'll win." huh????? i was taught history in birmingham, al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and richer.....that's why they won. course, they also literally had god on their side. as you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he's cutting out to free his mother, sold into slavery in texas. god, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.acting pretty good, lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle (but didn't hear any rebel yells, so reminiscent of football games in alabama). you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was, as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. they have lost sight of why they're fighting, and so do we. just more mindless slaughter.you're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has his arm seared shut, trying to save it, then has it amputated, and then dies. so much suffering for such a stupid cause.the cinematography is fantastic. now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew history. the dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. you see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. you see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger. as i read the escalating number of women and children dying in iraq, i'm thinking, "where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?" i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere lauded it. with good reason. tobey at his best, pre-spideyman. buy the dvd or rent it. and tell me why others laud this, not just liberals cest moi.

one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e.g., tobey maguire (before spiderman), skeet ulrich (before jericho), jonathan rhys meyers (before tudors), james caviezel, simon baker, mark ruffalo, jeffrey wright, tom wilkinson, and jewel. all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.when the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. however, it is seldom every seen on cable. i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known.

i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script.jonathan rhys myers (misspelled) and jewel were outstanding in their support roles. as was jeffery wright. toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm, knowing he would die without the procedure. attention to detail, with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well.why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine. i have strong suspicions. which makes it all the more appealing to me. i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents.completely overlooked movie. rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours, then judge.

an unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. tobey maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. the script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. that said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a tv mini-series. still, frederick elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch). worth seeing.

when i heard this film was directed by ang lee, i made sure to see it. this taiwanese director burst into fame with "the wedding banquet" and "eat drink man woman" a few years ago and then moved on to "sense and sensibility" and "the ice storm". now, he turns his attention to another american icon -- the civil war.this story takes place in missouri, a union state with southern sympathies. these never officially joined the confederate army. instead, they formed outlaw bands, called "bushwhackers", grew they hair long, and sometimes would confiscated union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing.the movie depicts their moral dilemma, the high drama of the times, and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the union. there are no stars in this movie, unless you consider "jewel" the singer, well cast as a young confederate widow as a star.tobey macquire is cast as a young german farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the germans were supposed union sympathizers. this young man is an excellent actor, full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he's exposed to the horror of war.jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. he gives a fine and understated performance.some of the acting, however, is wooden, especially in the long conversations they have about morality. and their costumes are too new. and the "southern gentleman" theme of manners and hat-tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women's arms, then burn down the stores and houses.while i don't think that this will go down as one of lee ang's "great" movies, i did find myself fascinated by it, in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes. i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history.not as much action as the usual war movie, but yet still recommended -- especially for civil war buffs.

the most succinct way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word: authenticity. i will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film, but i would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer.as a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film, i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding "bleeding kansas". yes there were liberties taken on the actual events, as all fiction is apt to do. but the overall feel of the film is genuine. authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no pc hindsight here) even the actors look authentic.even jewel kilcher (who has a small part in the film) looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph.a few viewers i talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog. they cannot believe that 19th century farmers would "talk like poets".what they don't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness, the american public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch. these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible. the screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging from documentation of the time. the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.but in addition to a historical document, this film works on a visceral level as well. beautifully photographed and performed, it harkens back to the days of the great western epics. the raid on lawrence, kansas, done so many times before in so many other, lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action.romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict.this film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want. in a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like american beauty, this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system. but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it's due in the coming years. please rent this film. you will not be disappointed.

the star of this film is the screenplay. attention to detail for the period in dress, language ,social mores ( we don't hurt women) and the politics are remarkable. it is a reminder of kosovo to-day. the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received. it is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step. a great film....

ride with the devil directed by ang lee(crouching tiger) is another gem in this fine directors cap. for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas-missouri border wars during the american civil war. see this film & you will visit a sad piece of americana. besides some superb action scenes (quite bloody at times). this is a story of love & devotion between men & one lady in particular. it stars toby maguire, skeet ulrich jeffrey wright & as the young lady jewel, i never heard or seen her before, i want to see more of her).the acting is top notch, superb production values, very well written (adapted from a novel) this is a long film 128 minutes, but well worth seeing. my rating is **** respectively submittedjay harris

after seeing all the jesse james, quantrill, jayhawkers,etc films in the fifties, it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee. the scene of the attack of lawrence, kansas is awesome. the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys-meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war, and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours. definitely worth seeing.

ride with the devil, like ang lee's later brokeback mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended. a perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. i really don't recall another war film, will so capture you, will change your existing conception of history and politics, will restore your belief in humanity. after seeing so many killings, so many sufferings , you don't feel yourself numb, instead you treasure the bond between human beings more. the actors' performances haunt your heart, the music drives your mind. some shoots, are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves, becoming the seeing of soul. such is the true sense of film being a genre of art.a film like this doesn't need long comments or reviews, everything it says by itself. ovation to the cast which includes tobey maguire, jeffrey wright and jewel kilcher, the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!

ride with the devil has something rich and special, if you can stand the slow development. while tackling a dark, gritty subject, the brutal guerrilla war in the american west during its civil war (which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s), the movie maintains a strangely satisfying, unmanipulated atmosphere. what i'm refering to is the tendency of films' music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel. but rwtd instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack, and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer's senses.as an enthusast of this particular area of cw history, i'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film. the diologue is expertly written, (even with subtle humor occasionally) with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles (independence for example...a far cry from the oregon trail!). the minor events that occur to jake's band are similar to actual events that took place...especially the attack when they're holed up in the house, and the destruction of the store/booth. the battle scenes, though rare, are pretty well executed. it even has the first cw cavalry battle put on film recently.the directing shows the talent everyone expects of ang lee in subtle ways. example: the character of black john is shown taunting a lawrence resident during the massacre: "where's your army? who are we to fight!? who are we to fight?! (the shot then switches to a trio of confederate regulars standing, doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues) you are cowards all!" who are the cowards, really? little touches like that really enhance the movie's quality.there are no major glaring areas in the history, something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film glory, which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows. some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don't add up. but you will never notice that. a larger curiosity is the fact that the only african-american man-at-arms character in the film is the quasi-slave fighting for jake and his confederate bushwhackers. it is true that some blacks did fight for the confederacy out there, including one who scouted lawrence for quantrill before the attack (who would suspect him?). though this black rebel is a fasinating character (whatever pc african-americans might think of him), not a single black union infantryman is seen in the film, which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the western cw. one of the first black regiments of the cw was raised in kansas (by the murderer senator jim lane, and before the 54th mass. reg. of fame was organized), and black troops in such battles as baxter springs, ks, played a critical role.no glaring historical errors. good, realistic action, which is infrequent and not gratitous. good directing. this film may not be the blockbusters other recent civil war were, but it's the cleanest job of any.

the war between the states was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of america; a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed, and in all probability never will. and, as in any story about any war, beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving. it is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective, which is what director ang lee provides in `ride with the devil,' a civil war drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the war itself, and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the war, the infamous raid on lawrence, kansas, by quantrill and his raiders, which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the confederate point-of-view.in 1863, the union influence predominates in the state of kansas, and even across the border in neighboring missouri, those with confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching northerners, especially without the aid of what could be considered any `regular' confederate troops. and when things begin to really heat up around their own town, jack bull chiles (skeet ulrich) and jake roedel (tobey maguire) form a band of their own and join in the fray, doing damage to the union cause wherever it is practicable. jack bull and jake do not like the war and do not like killing; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right. there are others, however, even among their own, men like the young pitt mackeson (jonathan rhys-meyers), who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality, perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims. and so, for jack bull and jake, as well as many just like them, it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood. and they will have to ride with the very devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable odds.as with all of his films, director ang lee approaches his story through an incisive, yet subtle examination of the traditions, cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting. and in so doing, lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers, perhaps, a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged. whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters (`eat drink man woman'), the effects of class distinction (`sense and sensibility'), the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies (`crouching tiger, hidden dragon') or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above (`the ice storm'), lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level. this film is no exception; and (as he does with all his films), lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography (in this film, by frederick elmes, who also did `the ice storm' brilliantly), which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry. it's that special lee touch, and it adds a wistful, reflective sense to whatever story he is telling, which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable.as jake, tobey maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops, and his character along with it. most importantly, maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him, which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation: his stoic acceptance of death and the news of those `murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere, even in such troubled times; the betrayal, which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly. it is all of this that maguire achieves through his performance, and it is no small accomplishment. it is, however, the kind of studied, understated performance that is often taken for granted, which is unfortunate; work like this is worthy of acclaim, and should be recognized.skeet ulrich is effective, as well, as jack bull, and jewel (in her motion picture debut) turns in an engaging performance as sue lee shelley. it is jeffrey wright, however, who stands out in a notable supporting role as daniel holt, as well as jonathan rhys-meyers, who brings a chilling christopher walken-like menace to his role of pitt. also, in what amounts to a cameo role (one scene), mark ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time.the supporting cast includes james caviezel (black john), simon baker (george clyde), tom guiry (riley), tom wilkinson (orton brown), john ales (quantrill), john judd (otto roedel) and kathleen warfel (mrs. chiles). the civil war will forever be an open wound upon the nation; but hopefully, as time goes on, it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like ang lee and films like `ride with the devil' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing. in light of more recent events, it is something that is sorely needed, worldwide. film is a powerful medium; it can be educational as well as entertaining, and perhaps in the future more filmmakers, like ang lee, will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are. 8/10.   

strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark, so i had to wait for the video release. my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed. as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting, an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming. along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90`s.people who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriot(corny) or braveheart(acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it. 9 out of 10.

for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate, (which basically satanised the english), it was interesting to see this film. by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in, and they were the only nationality present. it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours. all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict, and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all.

taiwanese director ang lee, whose previous films include 'sense and sensibility' and 'the ice storm', turned to the american civil war for his latest feature. based on a novel by daniel woodrell, it follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas, known as bushwhackers, as they fight their northern equivalents, the jayhawkers in the backwater of missouri.as one might expect, there is plenty of visceral action, but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it - many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family. jake roedel (tobey maguire) is such a man, or rather, boy, as he is only seventeen when the war reaches missouri. he is the son of a german immigrant, but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a unionist, he joins his lifelong friend jack bull chiles (skeet ulrich) and rides with the bushwhackers. despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed union men, he remains loyal to the cause. so does his friend daniel holt (jeffrey wright), a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the south.lee handles the subject with aplomb, never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war - long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting. the action is unglamorised and admirably candid, recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities.the performances are superb, with maguire and wright both courageous and dignified. up-and-coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer, while skeet ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant. lee never flinches from the reality of war, but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it - the growth of friendship, the demonstration of courage and, on a wider scale, the emancipation of oppressed peoples. ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience.

this movie is one of the sleepers of all time. i gave it a 10 rating. the story is of the famed 'bushwhackers' out of missouri that fought on the side of the south during the war between the states. the clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. there was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for hollywood. the actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them. i suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. not just one or two... this movie really jelled! it has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. even has the future spiderman and jewel. and she's good!

in anticipation of ang lee's new movie "crouching tiger, hidden dragon," i saw this at blockbuster and figured i'd give it a try. a civil war movie is not the typical movie i watch. luckily though, i had a good feeling about this director. this movie was wonderfully written. the dialogue is in the old southern style, yet doesn't sound cornily out of place and outdated. the spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie. toby maguire was awesome. i thought he was good (but nothing special) in pleasantville, but here he shines. i have always thought of skeet ulrich as a good actor (but nothing special), but here he is excellent as well. the big shocker for me was jewel. she was amazingly good. jeffrey wright, who i had never heard of before, is also excellent in this movie. it seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand. a movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa. this movie had the perfect combination. the actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular. this movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others. it lets you really get to know the characters, which are all very dynamic and interesting. the plot is complex, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing, and ready for anything at any time. literally dozens of times i was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were "too quiet" (brilliant directing). this was also a beautifully shot movie. the scenery was not breath taking (it's in missouri and kansas for goodness sakez) but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings. has that rough and rugged feel, but keeps an elegance, which is very pleasant on the eyes. the movie was deep. it told a story and in doing so made you think. it had layers underneath that exterior civil war story. specifically, it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for. there were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie, too many to pick out. it was like a beautifully written short story, filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done. if you like great acting, writing, lots of action, and some of the best directing ever, see this movie! take a chance on it.

easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire. but don't watch this movie expecting to be "entertained." ang lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the civil war. what is beautiful about the movie, like all of lee's films, is that he doesn't "side" with his characters. he creates characters, embodies them with life, problems, and ambiguity ... and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable. this film has action, but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... i.e. like the characters, it is real. and as you would expect about one of mankind's most horrific wars, the violence is horrific.but as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the civil war, it is a masterpiece. was the war about slavery and an abolitionism? lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the blue and the grey. neither is about idealism, though, as seen in gone with the wind. it is about freedom, about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it. as you watch the characters, you will ask yourself "how can they be fighting to preserve slavery?" the fact is, i don't think they really are, and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the civil war.the fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to "home" though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values. the letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle. jake and daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits. and when the tension finally snaps, and these characters find themselves suddenly "free" ... we see the birth of new men.all this mixed in with lee's beautiful incorporation of humankind's environment with breathtaking vistas and frames. lee has a style which is his, somehow european in its "art" (a slow camera, unrushed), asian in its epic-ness and development of story, and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in north americans.relax, let go of your preconceptions about what the civil war is, what the "western" as a genre is, what a war movie should be ... and let ang lee take you into a world so fragile, so hard, so real that few of us can comfortably see it.in this, lee continues what he wrought in ice storm. again, the movie is slow paced and without apparent "direction" ... a sure sign of lee's ability to direct without "imposing" himself on the story or screen. his direction is amplified by what he brings out of jewel (yes, the singer), a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance.a movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard hollywood epic.

i've watched this movie twice now on dvd, and both times it didn't fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude. it seems more like a depiction of reality than most other hollywood fare, especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed. even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint, it doesn't fail to question it, and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost, not matter what, and cruelty is a common denominator.what really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over-dramatize. nowadays truly good movies (in a nutshell) are few and far apart, with mainstream fare being enjoyable (if you don't have high expectations), but terribly commercially spirited. i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie (without being a masterpiece), because it sticks to itself, and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it, instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence. this movie is cool, observant, and generally light-handed in its judgement, which is good.the story has its flaws, especially jewel's character comes off doubtfully, but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic, that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life, even by liberally taking each next guy. still she doesn't come off as weak, in fact i think she's one of the stronger characters, she's always in control of the relationships, with the men just tagging. and i take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow. i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now. you could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries, so the prospect of of someone dying, while surely causing grief, didn't traumatise people like it does now. people didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now, and i like that attitude.my recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie, if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare. don't watch if if you want non-stop action or heart-renting emotion.

this movie was made in hungary i think. anyway,the countryside is gorgeous,the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating. their horsemanship is awesome. i got more into the native people, the farm life, and how heroic they were trying to hide brady from the evil nazis who where looking for these parachutists. they even sacrificed their life in several instances. the young orphan lad that brady befriends was a sweet kid. you will marvel at the riding i think, and the action of trying to evade the nazis. it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. ladies have hankies handy, as you will be devastated at the end. i own it, and have watched it several times. in other words, not just a one time around flick. its a keeper....

this movie is why i found this website. i couldn't find this movie anywhere else! i am so glad we found it here! we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it. one other poster commented that it is was boring, though i must say that it is not. especially if you are a horse person, you will love this movie. the horses are awesome, well trained and the movie is well done. it is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home dvd library. we will be recommending it to our friends. the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times.

a beautiful movie, especially if you like horses,wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau.a story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training.i will buy this movie and watch it again. this is a family film and i recommend it highly.a good ''family nite'' movie. although there are some violent scenes, it was the nazi occupation of hungary.the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady.a hauntingly beautiful film.

sad story of a downed b-17 pilot. brady is shot down over occupied territory. the local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives. i had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours. after the film is over, i'm glad i took the time. it's an entire story told to explain the look on brady's face at the start of the film.

given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. it is plausible, realistic, and shows how the csikos (hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis. we are drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressionable, yet highly courageous boy--who admires the american pilot. if you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you. if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this movie. i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time.

really enjoyed this little movie. it's a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays miki is especially good). there's so many large scale impersonal films set around ww2, that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm, and an original one at that. i'll also add that this film is far from boring, very far!! of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. to anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family (i do), you'll find this film especially rewarding. recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different.

a nice shirely temple short. child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. perhaps being "seen and not heard" needed to be made up for. aside from that this is fun. given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very progressive and liberal. i won't go into those here, i'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple. that makes it worth watching if you're a temple fan. for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove.

this is the second baby burlesk short to be released, and probably the most popular one, is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glory.i watched this and i do not understand the kiddie-porn that is being claimed. it is just a cute little film. i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the '80's and '90's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a 'mature manner'. it was more provocative because they weren't dressed in diapers. there's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes. (just a joke) i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this. that is sick. to me, if you watch this and are bothered by it, then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you. it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film. all of the b.b. films were parodies, nothing more. the parodies/spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language. shouldn't those be more appalling? i can watch those without issue, but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies. that is what should get under your skin. not that they babified (not a word, i know) an adult movie from 1926, because we know how pornographic those silent films were, huh? not to mention those 'forbidden hollywood pre-code era films' so vile and filthy. they would never make such filth today? (note the sarcasm)

while browsing the internet for previous sale prices, i ran across these comments. why are they all so serious? it's just a movie and it's not pornographic. i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it. i've shown it to many of my friends & they all loved it too. i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known. after reading the other comments, i agree that the film is "racy". big deal! i only wish it was longer. it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals, for sale at least, so i wonder how much it's worth?

i myself feel this film is a rare treasure. not only is it the beginning of shirley temple's career, but a rare look on how our society has changed. you have to understand, certain things we today would view as sexual, back then would be considered innocent. for example, the parents of the children in the film as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw this as just children mimicking adults. most people didn't think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive, other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls. to them it wasn't sexual. mind you this was before we had internet, tv, etc... most sex crimes weren't openly brought up. occasionally there would be a whisper about the kid with the "funny uncle." but that was often all that came of it. yes very sad. but it is kinda sad today, for even i too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended, innocent and funny. when i saw shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her, yes i felt disturbed. i have to remind myself the time this took place! those children didn't know what sex was. the parents knew that, both those of the children in the movie and those watching it. the thought may not have even entered their minds. in the eyes of the average adult back then, this was no more sexual then if shirley was playing house. even today kids will enter beauty contest, many dressed up extremely maturely, for a three yr old. however the child is merely pretending. i don't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. or the old movies that display this. in all honesty, our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong. this sometimes can be for the best. but i truly believe this movie isn't one of them. it gives a rare look of an innocent mentality, that we have long lost.

i love these "diaper baby" movies! you couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does. how they ever got these kids to "act" i'll never know. i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. it was a different time with a totally different mind set.

a shirley temple short subject.it can get mighty rough at buttermilk pete's cafe when the local contingency of diaper-clad war babies come in for their midday milk break.this primitive little film - a spoof of military movies - provides a few chuckles, but little else: tiny tots talking tough can begin to pall in a short time. shirley temple, playing a duplicitous hip-swinging french miss, hasn't much to do in this pre-celebrity performance. highlight: the real signs of toddler temper when a few of the infants unexpectedly get well & truly soaked with milk.often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films.

the late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies, what with the rise in budgets during the economic recovery, the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became enforced and the general carefree optimism of the times. while most of these were rip-roaring swashbucklers about the wild, superhuman and often frankly misogynistic exploits of heartthrobs like errol flynn and tyrone power, gunga din is very different in its focus, scope and tone.part of gunga din's secret is the division of labour in its writing team. the original story is by ben hecht and charles macarthur, two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of hollywood's golden age. however the actual screenplay was the work of joel sayre and fred guiol, both of whom, guiol especially, had a background in comedy. what we get from these four is a plot that is well-balanced and engaging, yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches. most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies, usually featuring one or two comic-relief supporting players, but they didn't use laughs in the way gunga din does. here, all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes. we see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light-hearted brawl. the first main battle scene is an even-handed blend of action and gags, in the style of the silent swashbucklers of douglas fairbanks, sr., something which the flynn and power vehicles largely failed to replicate. towards the middle of gunga din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot. however the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this "slow" portion bearable.producer-director george stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the hal roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point. this was his first full-on action feature, and he does a startlingly good job. in particular his use of moving point-of-view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating. he also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era  a sense of real dread and fear. he sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains dominating many of the shots and dwarfing the characters. the portrayal of the abandoned village and the thuggee cultists cry of "kali!" is genuinely haunting. this dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here, causing us to worry for these likable characters, and making the comedy a greater relief of tension.a real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience. we are made aware of din visually, as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or verbally refer to him. because of this, we are given the impression that din is not an important figure within the regiment, but he quickly becomes a notable character to us, and crucially a sympathetic one, as we see him risking his life and giving water to dying men.but the best efforts of writers and directors are all for nought without a capable cast. fear not, for gunga din has a top-notch one! victor mclaglan and cary grant were ideally suited to the material, since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy. grant in particular is at his best, largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over-the-top whooping and capering that was his trademark. douglas fairbanks, jr. is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions, but he is by no means bad. and of course there is sam jaffe, cursed by his looks to forever play these wizened little oddballs, but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity? i have not set out to bash the swashbuckling adventures of errol flynn and tyrone power, and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that i love absolutely. but gunga din does things that even the best of those swashbucklers could never achieve. not only does it dispense with the dashing male lead or the clichéd defiant damsel, it successfully merges the action genre with comedy and poignancy, in a way that few pictures have done before or since. and that's fabulous.

this happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler, based rather loosely on rudyard kipling's memorable poem as well as his novel "soldiers three," qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the british imperial army in india in the 1880s. cary grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together. set in faraway india, this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged british sergeants and their native water bearer gunga din (sam jaffe) who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous indians called the thuggee. sergeant archibald cutter (cary grant of "the last outpost"), sergeant macchesney (oscar-winner victor mclaglen of "the informer"), and sergeant ballantine (douglas fairbanks, jr. of "the dawn patrol"), are a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-brawling, and fun-loving alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because ballantine plans to marry emmy stebbins (joan fontaine) and enter the tea business. naturally, cutter and macchesney drum up assorted schemes to derail ballentine's plans. when their superiors order them back into action with sgt. bertie higginbotham (robert coote of "the sheik steps out"), cutter and macchesney drug higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and ballantine has to replace him. half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves. director george stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of thuggees. lenser joseph h. august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography.

early hollywood at it's best!! a classic kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast. i think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it. i've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and, admit it, you do too!!

i only saw it once. this happened in 1952, i was seven, the movie 13.we were so young... but i kept in mind, forever, the strong moments of gunga's sacrifice.i realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation. under these historical circumstances, in the movie, the personal relation of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, the one raised between people who share daily life, who see each other faces, who knows each other names, but belong to different worlds, can only make appears. then, in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges: "whom are we, in first, supposed to be loyal?", which people, family, motherland, the person you know close to you?. you do not have time to give a perfect answer, urgency is there, and it is for life or death. gunga-din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself. somewhere, in a confuse manner, a problem remains unsolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today, because this death, this unique vanishing life i lived it, i shared with my child unconditional friendship. it was lived by the spectator i was. that day i loose gunga-din for ever. as i left behind, later, my pretty childhood, as i left from then so many worlds i lived in. i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i didn't expect to do this morning when getting up.

this movie had it all,action,comedy,heroics,and best of all some of the finest actors.gunga din will remain a classic to be enjoyed by all who like good movies.excellent picture,i have it in my collection.

cary grant, douglas fairbanks jr. and victor mclaglen are three soldiers in 19th century india who, with the help of a water boy (sam jaffe) rid the area of the murderous thuggee cult. the chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time. sam jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem. a must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie.

this is a ripsnorting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. i understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of the indians was unacceptable. but this moving isn't about politics. it's about action, dialogue, comradery, acting, direction, music, and photography, and it's marvelous on all these factors. grant, fairbanks, and mclaglen are electric together, and jaffe is superb. this is the ultimate buddy movie.

the film is based on kipling's heroic lines that inspire hollywood's biggest movie 1939.out of the drumbeat rhythm of kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one great movie of the year.big on the score of its armies in battle,its war elephants,its bandit hordes,its terror temples thugs and mystic mountains of india .the picture is bigger still in its scope and sweep,is thrill and action but biggest biggest of all in the life breathes through three(gary grant,victor mclagen and douglas fairbanks jr) roaring,reckless,swaggering sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stride its mighty scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure,it's a honest film of it all that makes gunga din a new experience in entertainment .joan fontaine gambled her against the valiant sergeants three.the romance between fontaine and fairbanks jr aflame through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where anything can happen. the motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one mighty show.it's a fabulous,furious and far-flung adventure with the red-blood and gunpowder heroes who rise from the storied mystery of india and storm the screen with the lusty,rousing,robust life-thunder of men who fight for the love of it and love for the fun of it.the pictures is interpreted for the brave and roguish gary grant who rounded hundred villains thugs and the mean guru(eduardo ciannelli), grant shouts : you're under arrest!.besides is the heroic water man,sam jaffe,who regiment colonel(montagu love) says of him : you're a better man than i am,gunga din!

" now in india's sunny 'clime, where i use to spend my time as a soldier in the service of her majesty the queen . . . " so goes the famous poem penned by rudyard kipling. this is the literal foundation upon which the movie "gunga din" is based. if you are fortunate enough to watch this legendary classic, you will enjoy films the way they use to make them; for the sheer pleasure. taken from the script of the established novelist and poet, this is a story of a humble indian native named gunga din (sam jaffe) who works as 'a regimental beasty' during the british occupation of india during the 18th century. his greatest wish is to become a soldier. the water boy is part of a british calvary contingent threatened with death by a notorious blood cult of kali called the 'thuggee.' three particular soldiers stand out in this company who are noted for their bravery and comradeship. first is handsome and debonair, cary grant playing sgt. archibald cutter. next is victor mclaglen as courageous sgt. macchesney and finally there's flamboyant douglas fairbanks jr. as sgt. thomas ballantine. all three and their fellow soldiers are surrounded by a hoard of mountain stranglers led by their fanatical leader called the 'guru' (eduardo ciannelli). amid the chaos of war, is the brave water-boy who hopes to earn a place in the army by playing a bugle he found. a solid story for an old black and white film which needs little fanfare for anyone looking to enjoy a classic. ****

the story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film "gunga din." based loosely on the rudyard kipling poem, the film is brilliantly directed by george stevens and stars cary grant, douglas fairbanks jr. and victor mclagen. the title role is played by sam jaffe, well known in my era as ben casey's boss, dr. zorba, a name that became synonymous with big, out of control hair. say "dr. zorba hair" to anyone of my generation, and they know what you're talking about.set in india at the time of the british occupation, three soldiers - two romantic, dashing figures in grant and fairbanks, and mclagen as a big lug - are cut-ups - in reality, three overgrown boys. gunga din is the water carrier, treated somewhat meanly - verbally, anyway - by mcchesney (mclaglen), but cutter (grant) is fond of him. when he catches din (pronounced deen) practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers, cutter gives him a few pointers.the merry band of musketeers is going to break up when ballantine (fairbanks) announces he's about to be married to a lovely young woman (joan fontaine) and leaving the service. however, when gunga din and cutter run across thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (eduardo cianelli), gunga din escapes to warn the unit, and ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save cutter. it's a buddy movie after all."gunga din" starts out lightheartedly, with slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, particularly by cary grant, who is quite funny. both he and fairbanks are so handsome, it's hard to decide which one to look at first. much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting. in the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, thrilling battle.grant has the showiest role, fairbanks is the lovesick romantic, and mclaglen as mcchesney, mostly due to his treatment of gunga din, is the most unlikeable character, although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant annie. his softness comes through toward the end of the movie, particularly in the very touching, tear-jerking final scene.always a gentle and likable actor, sam jaffe gives a beautiful performance as gunga din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. without much dialogue, jaffe conveys gunga din's soul magnificently.this is truly the ultimate adventure film, massive in scope, with good acting, rousing scenes, a wonderful musical score, and some beautiful cinematic images. another one from that remarkable year, 1939. highly recommended.

gunga din (1939) is based on rudyard kipling's poem.the movie is directed by george stevens.it's set in india during the 19th century where three british soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult.gunga din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments.the three leading men are brilliant.cary grant is sgt.archibald cutter, victor mclaglen is sgt.'mac' macchesney and douglas fairbanks jr.(the son of the legendary you know who) is sgt.thomas ballantine.let's not forget the other fine players who include sam jaffe playing gunga din himself in a brilliant way.the beautiful and gifted joan fontaine is emaline stebbins.it's awfully fun to watch the difficulties of tommy's and emmy's wedding plans.gunga din is awfully lot of fun.it can be funny, it can be thrilling.it can be everything a good movie requires.

"gunga din": one of the greatest adventure stories ever told! a story about the british foreign legion in 19th century india and a lowly "water-bearer" named gunga din, a local denizen who aspires to be just like his military counterparts; three british sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie for each other extend far beyond the bounds of mere patriotism. their's is a true and abiding friendship for one another and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the good of the other. gunga din longs to be a soldier too, a bugler in particular, but can never attain that rank due to his subordinate social standing. however, heroes are not made according to their social credentials, they're made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. gunga din tries at every turn to prove his mettle, but will he ever attain the rank he so passionately seeks?...."you're a better man than i am, gunga din"! one of hollywood's classics and a perfect 10!!!!

this- and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap opera-was the greatest epic to come out of hollywoods greatest year, 1939.i will not not restate the obvious-cary grant,victor mclaglen( who was a bengal lancer), and douglas fairbanks jr. give superb comic performances.however, i want to note two other, less understood elements of this masterpiece. the magnificent final battle sequence, as the wonderful sam jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment, is simply grand. it never fails to enthrall me. yet another underrated element in the film is eduardo ciannelli's performance as the guru. this is no fu manchu caricature, but an well drawn, articulate, historically informed ( "have you ever heard of changruputra maurya?he defeated the armies left in india by alexander the great")villain. indeed, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties( a german, not an indian). gunga din, anti-nazi tract? not quite. but still, a tremendous, funny, moving epic.

its about time that gunga din is released on dvd. i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but, i never tire of it. the lead actors worked so well together. victor mclaglen (sgt mcchesney), cary grant (sgt cutter) and douglas fairbanks jr (sgt ballentine) are an unbeatable team.i just cannot get over their exploits in india. your first glimpse at the sergeants three, is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called treasure map. the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town- or so they think.they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few "residents" in hiding. soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base.later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din. they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters. din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured. soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din, and they are too captured.faced with being killed, they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them. the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush. in doing this, din is shot dead.the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them. at the end, din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army.

three sergeants in the british army stationed in india, are sent out to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the thuggees. one of the sergeants, cutter, leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the thuggees lead by the sinister guru. gunga din, the regiment's water boy, goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him, but are also captured. now the major sends a full detail out after the three, but do not realize that they are walking into a trap set by the thugees. it is though, gunga din who saves the day. excellently made buddy film, even though it is today politically incorrect. grant, mclaglen, and fairbanks do give very humorous and thrilling performances with jaffe very well in the title role and cianelli very sinister as guru. rating- 10 out of 10.

my favorite "imperialism" movie and one of the best action-adventure flicks of all time. grant, mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please all but the most "pc" of film goers. memorable scenes abound -- the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs; macchesney & cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch ("save some for the elephant"); cutter to macchesney -- "i'm an expedition"; din breaking cutter out of jail, with a fork ("what do you think i'm trying to break out of? a bleedin' pudding?!) and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing, bold as brass -- "all right, you're all under arrest!"i could go on, but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on. for armchair adventurers and generals, it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours.

i did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention, what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the heroism,bravery and the honor to have served in her majestys service.this film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be,however i cant say enough for the courage exhibited by sgt.cutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group.to be certain sgt. cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her majesty the queen of england.i think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was great.a reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear.i think grant was excellent in this role,truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he wore.i never felt ballantine was a shoe-in ,in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture.what do i mean?this picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention.both ballantine and machesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her majesty.these three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a useful,even enjoyable interlude when ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene.is it believable?i don't know.i think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the regiments post when ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the service,and getting married and going into the tea business.machesney says he could sign up for another 9 years.it will make a man out of him.i like that sentiment.i don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests.where does this end,in fact it may never end.those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years old.i had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about kali.there is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the goddess of kali,this motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligence.this is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted.i think this is an excellent film.george stevens directed.there is a few items to be aware of i don't think all the information will jive with history however when the journalist is addressed as mr.kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is rudyard kipling?george stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred.the information is honest,compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga din.there is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned.sgt.cutter is seriously wounded and ballantine as well as machesney are restrained.din having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending peril.with a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee temple.the sound of gunga dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned.a very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified.it is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now shows,sgt.cutter says good work soldier.i don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril.the end is far from being anti-climatic,it is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed.ballantine knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes machesney quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time.the colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense.machesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medal.this is a very sober point and then he comes to din.now here is a man who has no actually status so i am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored dead.the poem is read as though it was just penned by kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the men.gunga din bravo!

of all the british imperialist movies like four feathers, charge of the light brigade for example, this movie stands out as the cream of the crop. it reflects a time when "the sun never set on the british empire." get over it. i won't go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great. i have visited the alabama hills and have photographed the pass through which the british marched and it remains as it was, unchanged by time and encroachment by man and vandals. and even though i know it's coming, seeing din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read "yes, din! din! din!you lazarushian-leather gunga din!though i've belted you and flayed you,by the livin' gawd that made you,you're a better man than i am, gunga din" i still, at 54 years of age, get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar. the range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie. like the ending of another great film, of mice and men.

i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i can't help but be entertained by it. gunga din is one of those classic movies made in hollywoods golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made "monsters" to carry a scene. the onscreen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by cary grant, victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr. is suberb and very entertaining to watch. the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beutifully and flawlessly. some might consider it "corny" but i consider it "classic" filmaking and acting at its best. one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil. gunga din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades. in short, its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either.

....rather well done, actually--attack the evil villains in their lair, stop a little big horn style ambush, save the day via the waterboys' bugling, works for me. stiff upper british lip and all that.so how does it play on a dvd 66 years later? struck me as being like a western, subbing apaches or sioux for the thugs, and the us cavalry for the imperial british army. it's very colonial in it's outlook, you know? white man's burden and all that? kipling certainly would have approved.cary grant, fairbanks and maclaglen play it as broadly as possible, putting some buddy buddy slapstick into the mix between the shootings and brawlings for good measure. (i had no idea it was joan fontaine as the token army wife--did they leave some of her scenes on the cutting room floor? very short-) none of them were aiming for an oscar here--in fact grant was not at his best in a few scenes--but sod it, it still works. and where else would ben casey wind up as an indian bugler? only in hollywood.def. check this out if you like adventure and pseudo-western style antics. it was done by a bunch of pros, well i might add.*** outta ****

this movie is one of my all time favorites. cary grant, victor mclaglen, and douglas fairbanks jr...what a cast. not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din. drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled up into one. the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears. if you haven't seen it, i'd strongly recommend it.

the film was shot at movie flats, just off route 395, near lone pine, california, north of the road to whitney portals. you can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built. and you'll recognize the area from any randolph scott movie.i won't bother with the plot, since i'm sure it's covered elsewhere. the movie stars three athletes -- fairbanks fils, who must have learned a good deal from his dad -- grant, an acrobat in his youth -- and maclaughlin, a professional boxer from south africa. their physical skills are all on display.not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously. it's about thugees, a sect in india, whence our english word "thug." i can't go through all the felicities of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director, george stevens, was a polymath with a background in laurel and hardy movies -- see his choreography of the fight scenes -- and went on to the infinitely long dissolves of shane and the diary of anne frank. dynasties rose and fell. geological epochs came and went, while liz taylor and monty clift kissed in "a place in the sun." here, in his comic mode, he excels.this is a story of male bonding and it would be easy -- too easy -- to read homoeroticism into it, as many people do with howard hawks. or hatred of women. but it isn't that at all. sometimes things portrayed on screen don't deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention. men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not. (women share secrets.) read deborah tannen, nobody's idea of an anti-feminist. well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. for most of human history -- about nine tenths of it -- hominids have been hunters and gatherers, and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather. hunting is more effective as a team enterprise. men who were not very good at bonding were darwinianed out, leaving men who have a lot of team spirit. and grant, fairbanks, and maclaughlin have got it in spades.sorry to ramble on about evolution but i'm an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. did i ever tell you about the horse in vaitongi, samoa, that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me? you've got to watch the hooves.joan fontaine is lovely, really. only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies. i lived in saratoga, california, where her sister, olivia dehavilland, grew up and went to a convent school. pretty place.if you miss this adventurous lively farraginous chronicle of the british empahh at its height, you should never forgive yourself. it's so famous that it's parodied in the peter sellers movie, "the party." yes -- the colonel's got to know.

i saw this picture in 1940 for $.11 and i would like to secure a dvd in 2006 the film was the greatest adventure of the time and,like all epics,is still an entertainment marvel (b&w and all)you get a sense of real bonded friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of sam jaffe & eduardo cianelli are outstanding (this could not be done today i particularly liked the ending where the colonel recites the end of kipling's poem over the body of gunga din and tells the "untouchable" "you're a better man than i am gunga din"they don't make movies of this character today.the only cast member that is still alive today is joan fontaine

for years i thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of john ford, especially with victor mclaglen as one of the leads. it certainly has the same rough house humor that ford laces his films with. to my surprise i learned it was george stevens who actually directed it. still i refuse to believe that this film wasn't offered to john ford, but he was probably off in monument valley making stagecoach.victor mclaglen along with cary grant and douglas fairbanks, jr., play three sergeants in the indian army who have a nice buddy/buddy/buddy camaraderie going. but the old gang is breaking up because fairbanks is engaged to marry joan fontaine. not if his two pals can help it, aided and abetted by regimental beastie gunga din as played by sam jaffe.the rudyard kipling poem served as the inspiration for this rko film about barracks life in the british raj. the comic playing of the leads is so good that it does overshadow the incredibly racist message of the film. not that the makers were racist, but this was the assumption of the british there at the time, including our leads and gunga din shows this most effectively.the british took india by increments, making deals here and there with local rulers under a weak mogul emperor who was done away with in the middle of the 19th century. they ruled very little of india outright, that would have been impossible. their rule depended on the native troops you see here. note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal and gunga din is considerably lower in status than that.note here that the rebels in fact are hindu, not moslem. there are as many strains of that religion as there are christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real. of course to those being strangled they might not have the same view of them as liberators. but until india organized its independence movement, until the congress party came into being, these people were the voice of a free india.but however you slice it, strangling people isn't a nice thing to do and the british had their point here also. when i watch gunga din, i think of star trek and the reason the prime directive came into being.cary grant got to play his real cockney self here instead of the urbane cary we're used to seeing. fairbanks and mclaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities.best acting role in the film however is eduard ciannelli as the guru, the head of the strangler cult. note the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone else off the screen when he's on.favorite scene in gunga din is ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple. note how stevens progressively darkens the background around ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a ghoulish halloween mask. haunting, frightening and very effective.it was right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the british public started to question the underlying assumptions justifying the raj. but that's the subject of gandhi.gunga din is still a great film, entertaining and funny. it should be shown with a passage to india and gandhi and you can chart how the indian independence movement evolved.

pandro s. berman was "in charge of production" but that made him the so-called line producer. but who produced this epic, filmed not in arizona but in california's mohave desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the "gold temple", the thuggee huts, the british outpost at muri, the village of tantrapur, etc. the minor technical faults can and must be forgiven. what's unforgivable is the lack of an oscar for best music, although maybe the academy didn't offer such at the time. a single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood-setting. brilliant! one of the curious aspects of the production was the widow kipling's demands. an actor playing kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. in the initial release his scenes were cut, per mrs. kipling's demands. later they were included and lent a "connection" of kipling's immortal poem to ben hecht's screenplay. interestingly, this very typically and pro-british story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the british.

a rousing adventure form director george stevens (before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948's i remember mama and 1956's giant) that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow. loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem of the same, gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india. the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold. their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades, and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger-inspired space opera star wars (1977) to the similarly-plotted raiders of the lost arc (1981).the biggest reason for the picture's success, however, is the pitch-perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors. victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy, cary grant is the ultimate comic foil, and douglas fairbanks, jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable - perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn. the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon, and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what's missing from most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength. a huge hit in its day (the film was reportedly the second-biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind), and it remains arguably the best film of its kind.

obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well. george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din. the characters that grant, mclaglen, and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo, luke skywalker, and chewbacca. even sam jaffe's gunga din morphed into c-3po and r2-d2 and like him or not: jar jar binks.today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today. to a young boy this was a great film. three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush. not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight. too late to lament lost innocence.hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action, adventure, and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors.

a trio of buddies, sergeants all in the british army, carouse & brawl their way across imperial india. intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier gunga din, to save scores of the queen's soldiers from certain massacre.based more on the three musketeers than kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in hollywood's golden year of 1939. filled with suspense & humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum, it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the (sentimental) conclusion.it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, cary grant, victor mclaglen & douglas fairbanks jr., as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and, to all intents & purposes, indistinguishable. however, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time.(it's interesting to note, parenthetically, that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career; fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence, keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers.)the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage, making the last line of kipling's poem ring true. he is unforgettable.montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major, whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru. the rest of the cast, joan fontaine, robert coote, lumsden hare, are effective but have little to do. movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine's father.the film picks its villains well. the demonic thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked kali, hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. in 1840 the british military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion. henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares.

anyone with a young boy in the house who won't watch black & white movies should put this on their television set. when the child walks by, wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting's about, tell him this is a picture for adults and that he isn't big enough to watch it yet. that'll hold him there for a few minutes; director george stevens and his team will keep him to the end.i think my father did that to me, anyway, and i'm the better man for it. this classic adventure yarn, set in india during the british occupation, features a trio of army sergeants who find their tight union facing dissolution as one prepares to marry his sweetheart. help arrives in the form of a vicious thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against."gunga din" was one of the great movies to come out of hollywood's finest year, 1939. even more than most great movies from that golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. the theme music is instant hummable nirvana. while shot in california, the camera work (the only thing in "gunga din" that got so much as an oscar nomination) has a windblown grandeur that feels very much like the raj of a hundred years before. the battle scenes are shot in a very realistic manner, not too violent but very messy as people fall and shoot and run in all corners of each frame in a way that feels real, not staged like some cecil b. demille biblical slaughter fest.the script doesn't just set up action scenes, it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor. the main focus is on sgt. cutter, chasing after tall tales of golden treasures. it's a rare actioner for cary grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense.anchoring the trio is sgt. macchesney (victor mclaglen), who dotes over his elephant annie and tries to protect cutter from his own hare-brained schemes. he's just as funny in his own way, leaving sgt. ballantine (douglas fairbanks jr., displaying some nice errol flynnish dash) as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up.if "gunga din" was a lifetime movie, it would be about joan fontaine's efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks. but since it's a guys' film, the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save ballantine from a fate worse than death, not only marriage, but as cutter indignantly exclaims several times, the tea business, too.the political correctness police are hard on this film, not so much for the gender issue but the idea of british soldiers saving poor indians from the vicious thuggies. it reeks of colonial apologia. thankfully, this film was made back when, and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of derring-do and false racial pride, have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval. after all, for all their swashbuckling glory, the film's true sacrifice involves the title character, played so heart-wrenchingly by sam jaffe.back when this film was made, movie mogul jack warner had a saying: you want to send a message, use western union. still, it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in "gunga din." i watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what gunga din was really up to when he led cutter to the golden temple. was he really plotting revenge against his british overlords? would he have been justified in doing so, especially given macchesney's cold treatment of him? when col. weed delivers that eulogy, the poem by rudyard kipling on which the film is loosely based, was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism's folly, of lording it over someone who proved "a better man than i am" in the end? what did they make of the guru's great speech, delivered in perfect clipped english: "you have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith, which is your country, england. well, i can die for my country and my faith as readily as you...india, farewell."of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers: "kill for the love of killing! kill for the love of kali! kill! kill! kill!" which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the british, and save the questions about what it all means for later.what "gunga din" means to me, most of all, is the quickest, surest 90-minute thrill ride on video. cutter never found his golden temple, but there's one for all of us watching "gunga din."

i really wanted to like this film and i don't think i was terribly disappointed. being an american history teacher, i felt an obligation, almost, to see this film and as far as the history went, it wasn't bad. sure there were a few mistakes here and there (especially with the timeline--the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year--not over six years of actual fighting), but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent. unfortunately, the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist. for the most part, it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed "tacked on"--like a plot device instead of a real honest-to-goodness romance. in fact, as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of "love at fist sight", it was kind of annoying the more i think about it.however, in spite of this romance, the film is truly interesting and inspiring---plus, in so many ways it seems as if the much later film, the patriot, was copied from this griffith film!!! both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians--and both having the secret intention of using this as a "springboard" to starting their own nation in the america!!! the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas. it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d. w. griffith for the story ideas. it just doesn't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other.ps--despite me liking this film and some other of griffith's films, he does deserve to once again "burn in hell" for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film! this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his films--especially in birth of a nation. i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was a-ok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this "quaint institution" (don't get mad at me--this is meant as sarcasm).

i waited until the 4th of july to write this because . . . well . . . because it just feels right to be doing it on this day.in 1924 d.w. griffith needed a hit, he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm (1921). he'd been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences. he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution (dar) who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution. this movie is the result. by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn't a trace of patrick henry anywhere.we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan (neil hamilton) falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague (carol dempster, a leading lady for griffith for many years). complicating matters is the fact that nancy's father hates nathan . . . well not just nathan, he hates all rebels. it does not help matters when, during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan's arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy's dad!paralelling the love story is the (mostly true but partially embellished) story of capt. walter butler (lionel barrymore) a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one. with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire.comparisons with birth of a nation (1915) are inevitable. the montague family might just as well be the cameron's from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family. the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army, in this case the redcoats, storming a trench packed with patriots. the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man's land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon. amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in. something is clearly missing. it isn't scope, g.w. "billy" bitzer's camera work is quite good. maybe what is missing is . . . dare i say it . . . sincerity?the brutality of capt. butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen. don't expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance (1916). in one scene butler's second in command, capt. hare (louis wolhiem) gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist. we see only the beginning of the deed, for the remainder the camera focuses on hare's face as he obviously has a good time doing this. lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912. a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d.w., knowing the reputation of his famous family, said "i am not hiring stage actors." to which lionel replied "and i am nothing of the kind, sir!" he makes a very good and quite believable villain. louis wolhiem appeared with lionel's older brother john three times; in sherlock holmes and dr. jekyll and mr. hyde (both 1920) and later in the tempest (1927). as capt. hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also.neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and "i was scared to death.". he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over. mr. griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him. she refused and soon left his stock company, after which her star status gradually waned.speaking of horses, one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere's ride. he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce "to arms! the regulars are coming!" but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground! i am amazed griffith did not do another take.so is america a classic? yes! don't wait for july 4th to see it, it is enjoyable anytime.

slow but beautifully-mounted story of the american revolution. griffith's story-telling seems a lot less heavy-handed than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action. lionel barrymore is an utter swine, neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is.... well, carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period, but she doesn't show up often enough to slow the pace and drama.note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released, but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes. however, the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hours.far better in terms of story-telling than sound versions, such as the patriot. while not quite in the league of griffith's best, such as way down east and broken blossoms, an excellent way to spend a couple of hours.

(spoilers in first paragraph) this movie's anti-german sentiment seems painfully dated now, but it's a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda. it was made back when cecil b. demille was still a great director. (ignore all his later best picture academy awards; he never made a very good sound film.) this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickford's other films, and really it was demille's movie, not pickford's. the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way "the patriot" of 2000 did the same to the british. the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim. they even had pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine. so what'll get the americans more stirred up to war? the sinking of the lusitania, or watching america's favorite canadian import sinking in it? all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another, barely escaping death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution, and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed. the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in "jurassic park" were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors. if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a part-german ancestry. was it a good film? aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking they're untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained. you'll find it more than a little melodramatic, and obviously one-sided, but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before potemkin's false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movie's potential for propaganda. it made me wonder: what became of cecil b. demille? somewhere between the advent of sound and "the greatest show on earth" he seemed to lose his ambition. ben hur looked expensive, but not ambitious. in a sentence, this movie is for 1) film historians, 2) silent film buffs, 3) mary pickford fans, or 4) demille fans, if such a person exists.

mary pickford ("born on the fourth of july" as angela moore) is "the little american" (of french heritage); she falls in love with jack holt (as karl von austreim), who had moved to america with his german father and american mother. french-american raymond hatton (as count jules de destin of the "fighting destins") has fallen in love with ms. pickford. the love triangled threesome eventually wind up in france, with the great war (world war i, in hindsight) complicating their lives considerably.a mostly entertaining, if propagandistically flawed, cecil b. demille film. the torpedoing, and sinking, of a ship carrying pickford is "titanic"-like. the war intrigue gets dramatic as pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for france, while the germans occupy her ancestral home. of course, german lover holt arrives. it was difficult to believe they took so long to recognize each other as he moved in for the rape, but it was dark; and, prior events had them believe each other dead. the film goes way over-the-top in its symbolism. pickford was, by the way, canadian - though, few could deny she wasn't a "little american", for all intents and purposes.fun to spot "extras" who later became major stars include wallace beery, colleen moore, and ramon novarro - especially, watch for mr. novarro exhibiting "star" quality during one of the film's more memorable sequences: pickford and the wounded soldier saluting each other as he is taken by her on a stretcher. novarro even gets mary pickford to write a letter for him; obviously, he's got a future in pictures. also future-bound is ben alexander, who plays the boy "bobby"; he becomes a dependable child actor, and grows up to become a jack webb partner on "dragnet". ******* the little american (7/12/17) cecil b. demille ~ mary pickford, jack holt, raymond hatton

when the us entered world war i, the government forced hollywood to churn out propaganda films. the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickford.pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: jack holt (german) and raymond hatton (french), but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist.when the ship pickford is sailing on is sunk by the germans (think lusitania) because it is carrying munitions, pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the german commander. later on, of course, she runs into both holt and hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a château.director cecil b. demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombed-out village. they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing. against the wall is a very large crucifix. as they stand and watch, the wall collapses but the jesus figure remains, suspended in mid air. it's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un-artsy.pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. she was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm-waving histrionics many other actors of the day used. she's also very very pretty. holt is very good here in a leading-man role. hatton is ok. among the list of name actors in "extra" parts are wallace beery, ramon novarro, colleen moore, ben alexander, hobart bosworth, norman kerry, walter long, james neill, and edythe chapman.not a great film, but interesting to see us propaganda at work.

despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced. presented in digestible (as digestible as war can be) episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time. eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u.s. the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year.

this is a fantastic series first and foremost. it is very well done and very interesting. as a huge wwii buff, i had learned a lot before seeing this series. one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver. i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr. overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike.

this was by far the best war documentary ever made. from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in oradour-sur-glane 'the day the soldiers came'. to the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over japan, i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in 1974. each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. this whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that bigotry, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.

i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it. i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered. this is just how a doco should be, unbiased and factual. the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic. the only other series that i have found equal to this is 'die deutschen panzer'.i only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series, then they might make some great war movies.note. band of brothers, saving private ryan, letters from iwo jima, flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some i'd recommend

i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again, on dvd, over thirty years later. the pictures over the opening credits have never left me. it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it. my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we always discussed the programme afterwards. it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our school's public exams!sir laurence olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect. i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war. i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it. maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated, although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imagine.buy it!

this excellent series, narrated by laurence olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the end of world war 2. the origins are not entirely examined fully from germany's fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a 26-part series with so much to cram in. apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a world war 2 buff/fan. episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, britain, germany, japan, russia and the u.s.a. were quite eye-opening. showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. i'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (of which it could be said i am one at 47!).certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with frank whittle's experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor's combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262 - especially as the v-1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2. this is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more barren old science. but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated. a series to own as a box set in history terms, on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud.

i remember watching this in the 1970s - then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library.with a nearly 30 year hiatus, i have come to another conclusion. most of the principals interviewed in this series - some at the center of power like traudl junge (hitler's secretary),karl doenitz (head of germany's navy) anthony eden (uk) - are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on.from generals and admirals to sergeants, russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, all are on record here. i can remember the lord mountbatten interview (killed in the 1970s) this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work - well deserved.seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set.this is the only "10" i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with a little time...

the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2. the 24 episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it. the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power, and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world. they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war, and the holocaust. one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. all of you must watch this. perfection! 10/10

as so many others have written, this is a wonderful documentary. here is a list of the 'chapters' for anyone interested: 1: a new germany: 1933-1939 2: distant war, september 1939-may 1940 3: france falls, may-june 1940 4: alone, may 1940-may 1941 5: barbarossa, june-december 1941 6: banzai, japan, 1931-1942 7: on our way, usa, 1939-1942 8: desert north africa, 1940-1943 9: stalingrad, june 1942-february 1943 10: wolfpack 11: red star the soviet union, 1941-1943 12: whirlwind bombing germany, september 1939 13: tough old gut 14: its a lovely day, tomorrow: burma, 15: home fires: britain 1940-1941 16: inside the reich: germany, 1940-1944 17: morning: june - august 1944 18: occupation holland, 1940-1944 19: pincers: august 1944- march 1945 20: genocide: 1941-1945 21: nemesis, germany: february-may 1945 22: japan: 1941-1945 23: pacific: february 1942-july 1945 24: the bomb: february-september 1945 25: reckoning

this is what we can do to each other. this is the sort that everbody should see at least once.it does not glorify world. it shows that it is the everyday person who is killed, mained and debased by war. the person on the "other side" eats sleeps, laughs and cry just as we do.

war is hell. but this documentary of wwii is heaven.not only is this series a breath-taking, almost-exhaustive look at the second world war, it's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier.this documentary series defines the genre. it's sweepingly long, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more. (i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year).truly, this is an impeccable bit of film-making. other than olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories; whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper.i'm going to go watch it right now (again, my... 11th time).

i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s.i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it.it became a weekly ritual every sunday, and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special.the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document.so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each.some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic.while the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itself.this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead.the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time.anthony eden the foreign secretary,carl donnitz,head of the u-boats,albert speer,pet architect confident and later armament minister for hitler.in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge, hitler's secretary,who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament-she left the bunker after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines.these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed.if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code-breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers.the opening titles and music are magnificent,and lawrence olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script.the best documentary series ever made? without doubt.unmissable

still the definitive program about the second world war, the world at war isn't just long, but also very informative. the series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. most episodes are about the war in europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific. other episodes include information about the wars in africa, burma, the atlantic and the home fronts of germany, great britain, united states and soviet union. there is one episode that's dedicated to the holocaust. the series starts off with the episode a new germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. the series ends with the episode remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. each episode is like a mini-film. the footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. in addition, some of the footage is in color. the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining.the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television (uk). commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. the series was narrated by laurence olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them albert speer, karl donitz, jimmy stewart, bill mauldin, curtis lemay, lord mountbatten, alger hiss, toshikazu kase, arthur harris, charles sweeney, paul tibbets, traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose. jeremy isaacs says in "the making of the world at war" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to isaacs, was heinrich himmler's adjutant, karl wolff. the latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in himmler's presence.the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war. some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. in a list of the 100 greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, the world at war ranked 19th. the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. i've seen some of them several times. there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer. one is called the great war (1964) that's about world war i. the other is called cold war (1998) that's about the cold war obviously.

world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time. the historical research is virtually flawless. even after a quarter century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2. an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war. i highly recommend it as a learning experience.

i am not a very good writer, so i'll keep this short. world at war is the best wwii documentary that i've seen. i've seen different wwii documentaries (not only english/north american) and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i've seen. i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why/how hitler got to power, but it does a very good job at covering the war. it seems to be complete and objective/fair to everyone. it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations. it has a lot of original footage, including color footage and many eye witnesses (it was made in 70's when a lot more were alive). it has great music and narrator. all-in-all i gave this one 10/10, because it's that good. (i haven't seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those)

i remember watching this as a child in the uk, mesmerized by the story and laurence olivier's narration. we would talk about nothing else at school the next day. i imagine the ratings for the first showing were huge. this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much. what is interesting is that the battles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely unrecognized as such by americans. the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american generals, the suffering of german troops on the eastern front, the maltreatment of japanese prisoners of war by american troops. the images of the holocaust made me, a non-jewish european, feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people. i don't know why this is not number one in the imdb rankings. perhaps they are showing their bias against documentaries. spoiler - we win.

this is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of world war 2 from the invasion of poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945.honest and to the point, this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war. at the same time tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked, much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high, low and turning points in the allies fortunes. being a british produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on britain, but russia and america's contribution are not skimmed over this is but one such advantage of a series of such length.another worthy mention is the score, the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil, struggle and perseverance. like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the germans during the war, its build to a climax at the end of every episode, which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war. after watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation.

10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must see, with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years, untill this was screened in 1974. the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. the whole series is over 20 episodes long, and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still, and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch. you must watch this at some time, even if it's a few episodes, even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war, in a world at war..

example of how a world war 2 documentary should be made,using first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful conflict,and archived footage gathered from around the time .i caught this on a re-run on the history channel about a year and a half back,with no knowledge really of the second world war at the time,but it enveloped me,and now i consider myself a world war 2 buff,watching and reading any and all that i can find about it,but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary,definitely worth buying the boxed set of.............this is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard.

i must have seen this a dozen times over the years. i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b & w on the local pbs station.i bought a dvd set for the children to see, and am making them watch it. they don't teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. it expands their critical thinking.impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.buy it for your children, along with alistair cooke's america. watch it with them, and make them understand. you'll be so glad you did.

this should be required viewing for all young people. this is documentary at its best, from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses, the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanity's sorry experience at the nadir of the 20th century.

after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making. the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project. it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian(ken burns ?) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original. if you are interested in this era don't miss this series. it is required viewing.

certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison. the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation. no one country is given undue credit for the allied victory. laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator.

if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives, this dvd delivers, you will learn new things guaranteed, so much so that you won't need any other documentary's on the subject. get this, watch it, learn from it. good for school use as well. as a bonus, watch this with tora tora tora, saving private ryan, patton, band of brothers, a bridge too far, the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete. sir laurence oliver's voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26 part series. seriously you won't find a better wwii documentary set on the subject. perfect 10!!!

although too young to remember the first showing of the series (being just a baby) i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's, just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects. it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific. since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era, with mixed opinions. the british television stations are generally very good at producing these, as the world at war can easily attest, with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies. i strongly recommend such titles as "the nazis - a warning from history", "blitz" and the bbc series about dunkirk. "britain at war in colour", with its companion series "japan", "germany" and "america" are of a very high standard. the world at war is by far the best and, despite its age, never fails to deliver. there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other, even if such an undertaking was even possible. what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable. that certainly worked for me: i now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, dvds and tapes and cds. recommend to anyone with even a passing interest. the series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative.

the music and laurence olivier's sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary. this is still a must see for ww ii buffs, descendants of the participants of that conflict, politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier (did you hear that george bush?) and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict. the 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained. there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented. actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories. many of the interviews are with second line authorities, that is, support personnel to the main characters, privates, captains, secretaries, eyewitnesses and the like. you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about.i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary. i strongly recommend this over the worn out, gaptoothed, overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay. i paid $120 cdn for five 2-sided dvd discs. this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode. the menus are easy to follow, there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode. it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years, nay, after 60 years since the war finished.i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy. now my wish has finally come true.see this documentary. tell your friends. buy a copy for your library. remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america, russia, britain, canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory. what an eye opener.

my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times. i can't imagine how it could be better. this isn't the "complete" history of wwiino library could hold such a historybut it is the best summary of that history. lots of detail, lots of personal stories, and still keeps the overall picture in view.olivier's narration is excellently written and, of course, superbly given. the interviews are from all sides, except the russian, because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians. it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd. we treasure our copy.the producer's do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive: there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles, for instance, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done.

theo robertson has commented that waw didn't adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitler's rise and wwii.perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8? covers this period, and together with the earlier volumes in the series, shows clearly the existing conditions, i feel. a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period, joined the hitler youth even, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in waw.this documentary is so far above the history channel's documentaries i also own, that there is no comparison.the only fault, and it is a small one, that i have with waw is this: the numbers are not included, many times. for instance, if you're talking about lend-lease, then how much war material was lent/leased? how much to russia, how much to britian? how many merchant ships did the u-boats sink, and when? how many ships did the german or japanese navy have, total, in 1941? what type were they? how many troops? how many troops did the allies have, in total, and by country? lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off, but i would have preferred more! and naturally, i always want to see more military analysis. like why didn't patton & clark trap the german army that was at cassini, after they had it surrounded, instead of racing monty to rome, and letting it escape? i don't think you can begin to understand war until you've seen some of these video segments on "total war", like the fire bombing of dresden. it's like trying to understand auschwitz, etc., before you see the clips of the death camps: you just can't wrap your head around it - it's too unbelievable.unknown at that time, and of course, unfilmed, were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese, including cannibalism, (read "flyboys"), and some live vivisection of medical "experimentation" prisoners, w/o any anesthetic! dave

utterly brilliant. powerful and evocative. the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war. it's tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits. rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war, it allows sir laurence olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocents. most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of "civility" are removed. there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on. perhaps there could be a follow up series called "the century at war" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this.

this series, produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second world war, is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual's presumption to criticize.the timing of world at war's production in 1974, amounting to some three decades after the events of the war, permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant. the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did.the information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact. such names as ira eaker, adolph galland, louis mountbatten, albert speer, gertrude junge (hitler's personal secretary)... the list is far too long to relate. today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to ww2. the dvd series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price.i am almost done watching the 11 disk set, having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than 10 years ago. it has lost none of its poignancy to me, indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times.the highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation. i think the value of this series is beyond counting.

sometimes i watch a movie and am really impressed by it  and still it is not easy to explain why i liked it that much. this is mostly true for the uncommon movies  the ones one can hardly compare with the rest out there. goodnight mister tom is one of these special movies. there is a lot of emotion in that movie  and the acting was so good that while watching the movie, i was crying and laughing as the story went on. the young nick robinson  is a young boy (william) evacuated from london because of the air strikes there during the second world war. mr. tom played by john thaw is an old man leaving in the village the evacuated children were send to.at first tom refuses to take any responsibilities - such as taking care for a troubled young lad  but accepts since he is left without a choice. during the stay mr. tom discovers how horrible the life has been for the william  alongside his luggage his mom sent a belt and written instructions to the host of her son  not to hesitate to use it. this belt is berried in the field  never to be used in such a brutal manner. mr. tom provides a real home for william, and the boy is happy with his new life, he goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. all of the sudden a letter william is called home in london with a letter mentioning that she is not feeling welland it starts all over again  only this time it gets much worse there are many feelings you can sense in this movie  love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope  and much more. goodnight mr. tom is another masterpiece of the british cinema comparable only with others such as dear frankie and billy elliot  if one is to compare. i have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it. before finishing this review i would also like to mention the great performance of thomas orange in the role of zac  reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood ( :

quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids. john thaw is brilliant as always (without any hint of inspector morse about him). the boy playing william did a good job as well though i didn't find him convincing in every scene. i loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times. i also felt the scenes in london where historically accurate, as far as i could tell.it strongly reminded me of a scandinavian film i saw a couple of years ago called mother of mine. that film featured a boy being evacuated from finland to sweden during ww ii. the wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because (as it turns out)she lost her daughter. getting a boy instead she completely ignores him. the fact that the boy speaks finnish complicates matters even further. i highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed goodnight mr. tom, it has the same feel to it.

goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised. it isn't completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? no, not at all. john thaw is mesmerising as tom oakley. his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised, making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol. after inspector morse, this is thaw's finest hour. he was matched earnestly by a young nick robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother. the script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see thaw playing the organ. amazing! the most moving scene, was willie finding out about zak's death, and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina. buy this, you'll love it! 10/10 bethany cox

this movie resonated with me on two levels. as a kid i was evacuated from london and planted on unwilling hosts in a country village. while i escaped the bombing and had experiences which produced treasured memories (for example hearing a nightingale sing one dark night for the very first time) and enjoying a life i never could have had in london, i missed my family and worried about them. tom is an old man whose wife and child have both died and who lives alone in a small country village.as an old man who is now without a wife whose kids have gotten married and live far away in another province, i am again sometime lonely. the boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very odd ideas of raising a child. since a deep affection has grown between old tom oakley and this young lad, tom goes in search of him and finally rescues him from very odd and dangerous circumstances. at the end of the story there is great tension since due to some bureaucratic ruling it seems that the child is going to lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.

marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england. what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as "mrs. miniver" and "hope and glory." as is the case with this film, we see the desperation of people in the time of war.the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombing.we soon see why this child wets his bed. he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly.the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life. when the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy. he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home.the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships.

this is arguably john thaw's finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his inspector morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of tom from the pages of the book to the tv screen. this is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child.however it is the relationship between tom and young willie that is the heart and soul of this story. it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from london and the grumpy old man he is left with develop - a real grandfather/grandson connection.it is a pity that this story wasn't made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen, not shown once or twice every ten years on a sunday afternoon. given the right guidance, john thaw would be celebrated the world over and bestowed with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie. a great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time.

this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partner's grandson was given it. he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and me. luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it. not only did it capture the emotions, the class distinction, the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years (as well as the cruelties (spoken and unspoken); but it was accurate! i am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to arp uniforms, ambulances (lcc) in the right colour (white) and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades. i couldn't fault any of this from my memories, and the sandbagged anderson shelter and the wvs canteens brought it all back. the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war-torn london was also sharply presented i re-lived 1939/40 and my own evacuation from london with this production! i know jack gold's work, of course, and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail; but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half-uttered value judgements of those years. it was certainly one of the great high spots in john thaw's acting career and of gold's direction and deserves to be better known. it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.

well, when before i saw this film i really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong i was! i thought that this was one of the best films i've watched for a very long time, a real family classic. the story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' dad, this film ticks all the boxes. i've not read the book (maybe that's a good thing & meant i enjoyed the film more) but with regards to the story, i really can't think of any bad points, hence scoring it 10 out of 10 (and i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks!). by the time william proclaimed 'i can ride my bike, dad!' i was sobbing my heart out (anyone who's seen it will understand, i'm sure). really heartwarming, and definitely recommended.

this made-for-tv film is a brilliant one. this is probably the best and favourite role by bafta winning john thaw (kavanagh q.c. and inspector morse). tom oakley (thaw) widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died, and now he has been landed with an evacuee called willaim beech (nick robinson). as he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship. until willaim's mum (annabelle apsion) wants him back. after tom gets worried about william not contacting him he goes to london to find him. in the end willaim gets his home with a loving family (or dad). set during the second world war this is an excellent film. it was nominated the bafta lew grade award, and it won the national television award for most popular drama. john thaw was number 3 on tv's 50 greatest stars. very good!

a heartwarming film. the usual superb acting by john thaw, who passed over recently. a man who was always so unassuming. he was one of englands top 10 actors certainly of my time.he can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse. as jack regan in the 1970's hit tv series 'the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc. a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection. the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings. the interaction between the two main characters.tom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian.

absolute masterpiece of a film! goodnight mr.tom has swiftly become one of my favourite films of all time. nobody should miss out on seeing this film, it's just too good! mr.tom is perfectly portrayed by john thaw as the harsh old man who becomes a soft father-figure when william beech(nick robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like 'the town mouse and the country mouse'. a truly heart wrenching film. the director knew exactly how to turn book into film and he has done so extremely well. the film was so excellently shot that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a range of emotions from love to fear, and these emotions could turn on a six-pence. set in a time of turmoil during world war two, this film also shows the difference between the cities and the countryside, they are almost like different countries. an absolute must see, those who don't are missing out on a truly amazing and brilliant film.

john thaw is a an excellent actor. i have to admit that i was impressed by his range in the role of a crusty old curmudgeon who reluctantly agrees to take in an evacuee from the streets of london (wwii time era).that being said, the film is also excellent. a very moving story with a satisfying ending. some of the characters are a little underdeveloped (the school teacher in particular), but none of them are essential to the plot. basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the film needs little else.

this has to be one of the most beautiful, moving, thought provoking films around. it's good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved. every time i see the "ghost of zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end i can't help but cry my eyes out. john thaw's performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us. gone but not forgotten. a outstanding film. full marks.

i saw the movie before i read the michelle magorian book and i enjoyed both. the movie, more than the book, made me come close to tears on several occasions. this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go. i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible. i give it ten stars.

the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of maudlin,sickly sentiment.but,talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right manner,and it emerges instead as a compelling,deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances.one of the best,if not the best tv movies of the 1990's which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas.the evacuation of children to countryside towns and villages in world war ii was of course a common practice,but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the uk's capital.the horrors of war on the home front are not drifted over though,and the construction of the film until it's throat-lumping,misty-eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before.it is almost(but not quite)worthy of comparison with the finale to it's a wonderful life(1946).all in all,a modern classic.

if john thaw had never played "morse", "kavanagh", or starred in "the sweeney" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in "goodnight mr tom".superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co-star (young nick robinson in his first role), and an unobtrusive cast, this adaptation of michelle magorian's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art.when i read this story of an old widowed norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from london before and during the blitz, i found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error. they also must be applauded for not over-sentimentalising the tale, and preventing what could have been turned, quite easily, into a mushy mess.if you keep a cd or video library then this feel-good made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion.

john thaw, of inspector morse fame, plays old tom oakley in this movie. tom lives in a tiny english village during 1939 and the start of the second world war. a bit of a recluse, tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while he was serving during the first world war. if you can imagine inspector morse old and retired, twice as crochety as when he was a policeman, then you've got tom oakley's character.yet this heart of flint is about to melt. london children are evacuated in advance of the blitz. young william (willie) beech is billeted with the protesting tom. willie is played to good effect by nick robinson.this boy is in need of care with a capital c. behind in school, still wetting the bed, and unable to read are the smallest of his problems. he comes from a horrific background in london, with a mother who cannot cope, to put it mildly.slowly, yet steadily, man and boy warm to each other. tom discovers again his ability to love and care. and the boy learns to accept this love and caring. see tom and willie building a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. see willie's joy at what is probably his first ever birthday party thrown by tom.not to give away the ending, but willie is adopted by tom after much struggle, and the pair begin a new life much richer for their mutual love.in this movie, thaw and robinson are following in a long line of movies where man meets boy and develop a mutual love. see the late dirk bogarde and jon whiteley in "spanish gardener". or clark gable and carlo angeletti in "it started in naples". or robert ulrich and kenny vadas in "captains courageous". or mel gibson and nick stahl in "man without a face".two points of interest. this is the only appearance of thaw that i know of where he sings. only a verse of a hymn, new jerusalem, but he does sing.second, young robinson also starred in a second movie featuring "tom" in the title, "tom's midnight garden", which is based on a classic children's novel.

20 out of 10 this is a truly wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a curmudgeonly carpenter tom oakley. the boy (william beech) is billeted with tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he wets his bed on the first night. william is illiterate and frightened but somehow the two find solace in each others loneliness. it transpires that william has a talent as an artist and we see tom's talent as a choirmaster in an amusing rendition of jerusalem. william is befriended by zacharias wrench, a young jewish lad also from london and along with both tom and zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and to feel a part of this small close knit community. just as he is settling down, william is recalled back to london by his mother, and it is here we see why he is so screwed up. his mother is clearly mentally sick and when tom doesn't hear from william, he travels to london to look for him. he finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he has been tied up in a cellar. after a period in hospital, tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him. the climax is a bitter-sweet ending when william is told he is to be adopted by tom, while at the same time, learning his best friend zacharias has been killed in an air raid in london. for me, one of the most moving scenes was when tom was talking to a official from the home office.i love 'im, an' for what it's worth, i think he loves me too'.it just doesn't get better that that does it?

it's hard for me to assign the "fair" number of stars to this film, but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was, in 1968, an innovative approach to the war film. remember too that i haven't seen it since 1969. but it did make a strong impression.the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made. it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in 1944-45. no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail, and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves. there is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios.unfortunately, there's no subtlety either. partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat, familiar cliché's. as "entertainment," the film doesn't make it, though it was clearly not intended to "entertain." it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general. this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan, both of which are far more "watchable" films. here the flat and generally disagreeable characters, the lack of an actual plot, and the realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first on-screen vomit in theatrical history) make the film hard to sit through, though it is only 95 minutes.so, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over, a bonus star for having its heart in the right place. average: 8.like carl foreman's underrated "the victors," an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought-provoking film, the long day's dying seems not to be on dvd. why not? both films have been on cable a number of times.

i first read the book, when i was a young teenager, then saw the film late one night. about a year ago i checked it out on imdb and discovered no copies available. i then hit the web and found a site that offers war films, soooo glad that i did, ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why i wanted to see it again.in my opinion to really enjoy the film i suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film. the book is no longer in print but i did track a copy down via e-bay, the author alan white was a commando/paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book. it is written by someone who knows and this fact i believe gives the book and film authenticity. i have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film, not as good as the book. there are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also, which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war. the film illustrates this exceptionally well. i have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch, in that order.if you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and i only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see, one of my all best war films, ever!

i have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago, and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen. considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound. i would highly recomend this film, i wish it was available on dvd.

i saw this film prior to joining the british army. i went through my basic training, at first difficult and then as i progressed much easier. my time was spent during the height of the troubles in ni and the cold war. there was times when i questioned myself on what i had gotten myself into, not for long, as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively. the voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on, though i would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations. some years later i was in canada for a family get together. an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni. she spent some time out there researching. although an ex pat she was very anti-british. she made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a british soldier. my only answer was see the film 'a long day's dying'. it's the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does. the answer is right at the end.

not sure one can call this an anti-war film, it shows war at an elite level. these are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it. even when they are pacifist, they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes, even if it does go against being a pacifist. the movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go-more so by todays standards, no body parts flying off as in modern movies. it is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level. this is more of a thinking man's movie. once you start to watch you don't want to miss anything. the thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions, is what the movie is about- not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline. this maybe called a war triller.if you are into the skill of war, if you are into reading or seeing programs about the sas and so on, you want to watch this movie!!!!!comparable movies are the hill (1965) with sean connery, 49th parallel (1941) with an all star cast, the naked and the dead (1958) with cliff robertson. all are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level. enjoy!

superb film with no actual spoken dialogue which enhances the level of suspense. the whole approach gives a completely different twist to a war film.well worth watching again if only it could be found. i saw it perhaps 20 or so years ago. - fantastic!

this is not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most people i know would not.it's portraits the cruelty to both body and mind that happen in a war pretty well, the characters seem plausible, especially because you "read their minds", something more often found in books and rarely in movies, however done very well in this piece. i would place it next to "all quiet on the western front" and "die brücke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression.i wish i could screen it at school, along with the other two movies - however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard - which is a shame.

i saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view, it gave a realistic account, of men at war. the storyline moves at a nice pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. the characters are well developed, and believable.david hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction, as does alan dobie (as german helmut) i was surprised, that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd, and i feel it has become the forgotten film, which is sad , as it is superior to many other war films i have seen.

the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film. i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. because alan dobie was a friend of mine, i got to hear about it. i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor. i asked peter collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it. i was told, too late. so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off. i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. then i was invited to see the finished film. i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on. it's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, i expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if i had it wouldn't be so good. i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? i would also love to see the film again, i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho.

i was lucky enough to get a dvd copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time. the 1st time was on late night tv in australia more than 20 years ago but i could never forget this strange and bleak film..not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional - the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move - we just hear the thoughts of characters - is only one unconventional aspect of it.searching for a copy of this film i found out that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, it was not kept in any british tv or film archives, that it was never released on video or dvd, that television networks around the world trashed it after their copyright ran out in the 80's. when it was first shown on tv in australia there were no recordable devices for consumers.on the second viewing recently, i could see why it was unforgettable. at times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic very like a harold pinter stage play.again, if anyone wants a dvd copy of this please email me and i'm sure we can work something out regards adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)

when i saw it for the first time i was really impressed.the director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it first.but..the main point was not conflict but..friendship!older and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life.it is amazing. every time i watch it i enjoy!of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable. thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger! amazing film!i advice everyone to see it.i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time.

this is the best movie i`ve ever seen !!! thomas beckett & richard miller -two mankinds who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madnes, one shot - one killed !!? you must kill, if you getting doubt about something, you must survive !!p.p.- i appologise of my bad / worst/ english !!!

i am curious of what rifle beckett was using in the movie, and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing. if this is loosely based on carlos hathcock's sniping, i am guessing that it is a 7mm. round. i am also curious of the rifle itself. he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle that the vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father. beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. i would like to know which rifle that is also. i know that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand. i just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it.as for mr. hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills. after his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the usmc the skills that they would need in the field. his sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the usmc. i found out his name from my friend who is a former marine. any information would be great.

this was another great tom berenger movie.. but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome.. tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama! billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end! sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it.. i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick.. i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent!

this is one military drama i like a lot! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett. this marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. there you have billy zane("the phantom" and others) who plays richard miller, a former swat form d.c., works for the government and takes orders only from them. who needs a bureaucrat? i don't! when these two are paired, sparks should be flying. and how. however, beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. when the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. and when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him. who needs politics when you a pro like beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. the movie was a direct hit. watch it. rating 4 out of 5 stars.

just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt. barnes, he has done it again with thomas beckett. if i thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes, it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes. great movie, even for a girl.

zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. i don't typically go for military/war movies, but this was worth my time.it was serious, but it was also humorous. beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest. no matter what, you know that he's got your back.zane's character developed throughout the film. he wasn't just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun.the ending through me a little though. it didn't really go with the action throughout the film, but i'm glad that i saw it, nonetheless.it's worth checking out.

there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism. if you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war, take a look at this one. i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle, no-one quite sure where that shot came?and, they nicked one scene to saving private ryan, so it has to have some merit in the scene.

sunday would not be sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense combat, you turn to tom berenger (platoon).here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords. life's a bitch, so he gets a green office type (billy zane) to help on the mission.the film is in the hands of luis llosa, who stunk up anaconda. he doesn't do much better here, but berenger makes the movie worthwhile.sure, it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but is is good, tense action when the time is right.

some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. however, i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one.the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. tomas beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. however, after beccket showed his day dream of montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-hearted.millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart"(as what beccket said). what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. these two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one.

"one shot, one kill, no exceptions." a must see if you are into marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! great overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details, and more. pretty close to the real thing. but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults. this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins. the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think. its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action. sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie. tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life. the plain of dealing with all of the death. must see for sniper fans.

two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets; a slimy south american drug-lord and a prominent general.moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere, sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller, taking it's time, establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. director llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. but this film is far better than his stallone/stone travesty the specialist.billy zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger. as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture. he can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here, reprising the role twice more in direct to dvd sequels.

sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies. i remember movies about vietnam or wwii, lots of firing, everybody dies, bam bam. "sniper" takes war to a new level or refinement. the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for - the helplessness of humans in the jungle, the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller, and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger. a seemingly low-budget film makes up for every flaw with action, suspense, and thrill, because when it comes down to it, it's just one shot, one kill.

this will be somewhat short. first, don't listen to the critics, as it is not as bad as most say it is!! sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie. while sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper. and yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie doesn't? there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger. i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine's bar scene. the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it!! also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope. and yes, the sniper motto is `one shot, one kill'. judge sniper for yourself!!

despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages, it's still worth a look as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the panamanian jungle.peruvian director luis llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in panama. the film has some good moments as beckett, the veteran marine, takes a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country. the only problem, miller, has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve.miller, the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the guerrilla warfare between the military and drug lords against the infiltrated american intelligence men, learns a valuable lesson from beckett. what looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle.tom berenger, is an actor who doesn't register much, as he proves in this movie, but in the context of the movie, he is right as a man of a few words. billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until the crucial end.for lovers of action film, "sniper" offers an 112 minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a more satisfying movie.

****spoilers**** the film "sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos "gunny" hathcock. the unassuming soft-spoken mister rogers look-alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in "nam".which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is.tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgt.thomas beckett who's at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless. since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit-man. backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country.the story of the film "sniper" is focused on sgt.beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller, billy zane, being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle. the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze, frederick miraglittoa, and colombian drug king-pin raul ochoa, carlos alveraze, who's supporting him in a planned a military take-over of the country. we see earlier in the movie sgt. beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in "sniper". for it shows step by step how sgt. beckett with the help of his spotter cpt. papich, aden young, does his job. there's also a sub-plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva, eward wiley, who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter. you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt. beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait.what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo-like ending with sgt. beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog."sniper" is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies: a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy.

i've heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull. i don't think they were watching the right movie. this isn't the prototypical action movie, thank god.this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people. in this way it works extremely well, with terrific performances from berenger and zane (who doesn't sleepwalk through the movie like he has in other roles - he actually looks like he's acting).i was disappointed with the action towards the end - a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie. but watch zane's face as he panics, alone, while berenger does the dirty work.

there be very little doubt that hg wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century . jules verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices . wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales . perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including richard dawkins consider it a near certainty . there's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was wells who introduced this to human thinking ? undoubtedly it was wells that planted the seed .things to come was adapted by wells himself from his own novel . it is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays . the dialouge is often laden , heavy handed and unconvincing . one case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war " why must we murder one another . why ? " this mirrors the criticism , near naked contempt that orwell had of wells in his essay wells , hitler and the world state and it is true that wells anti-war message is painfully overstated . it'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an raf pilot and his opposite number in the luftwaffe a few years later that said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation . there's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of the wanderng sickness is wonderfully realised . even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature it's the images that makes this film along with arthur bliss score that makes the film so memorable . and to be fair wells does ask the question " the universe or nothing . what shall it be ? " . in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive

things to come is an historic film. along with metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles. it is also one of the first doomsday movies. it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year, and even, in a subtle way, the year it would end in the real world. but then the film departs from reality, depicting a world ravaged by war (only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936).the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight, making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre. it is sad that, after things to come, sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies, a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001:a space odyssey more than 30 years later. if they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film, things would have been very different in hollywood. raymond massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film, to good effect. massey plays a great "doctor who"-like role as a pilot from an advanced (for 1970) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by ralph richardson). ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. but that's a big problem with this film -- there really isn't a cohesive storyline.perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of intolerance, actually -- it's hard to have a conventional plot, but i felt more could have been made of the material, and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission ... the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting. maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation: a sequel?things to come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once. unlike metropolis, however, it might not bear repeated viewings.

this was the most costly film, when produced. sir alexander korda and h.g. wells were both distressed by its poor ratings---for good reason. it was and remains far ahead of its time. aside from the seemingly poor direction, probably editing, at the very beginning, the work moves along to a stunning conclusion.whether its sir ralph richardson's 'boss' role, or even better, his wife's, sir cedric's, as adversary to space-faring, raymond massey's 'john cabal' center role---all deliver mind-boggling performances.the scene with mr. korda's incomparable set, of the small girl-child, running out to an absolutely 'never-to-be-matched' scene, commenting 'life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier'? that swiftly brings tears to any parent/grandparent. this is not a film for the young--unless 'experienced' and rather those who have seen 'the horror' it opposes.sure, the 'phony-parachuting', looks hokey---while using a 'magnetic-cannon', now termed 'mass-driver' may be viewed as ridiculous, vs. rockets---give sir korda a break--mr. wells made that choice. and at +/- $8 million, this film went way beyond 'over-budget'---so he concentrated on what he could manage.the true power of this greatest of cinema rests in 'john cabal's' final statement of human destiny---his friend 'passworthy' doubts the wisdom of space-faring, saying, 'we're such little animals.' john cabal's proper response is,(paraphrased) 'yes, little animals, and if that is all we are, we must live and die as such.' they are standing under a large astronomical telescope. he sweeps his hand over the night sky. 'yet we may have all the universe, or nothing.'---then the final chorus breaks in---'which shall it be?'---this is not 'star wars', 'blade runner'---anything you may consider 'great'---this is the real thing.i remind all of steven hawking's most recent address, upon his latest 'medal of honor'---'humanity must leave earth, or die.'---the very core of this work---i love 'standard entertainment'---yet this 'relic', for the wise viewer, offers far more. 'which shall it be?' be in the proper 'mood'---whatever that takes---this will take your breath away---i 'guarontee'---overall, for humanity? the most significant of cinema. since posting, i note many have commented on the poor 'media-quality' of 'surviving' examples. in the 80's i developed a 'proprietary' 'colorization' process which required a 'clean' original. this led me to michael korda, who sadly noted all were gone---so we must relish what remains---'sad but true?'

this is an amazing movie from 1936. although the first hour isn't very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it. however, don't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accents (it's american - but "1930s" american) make it difficult.basically, the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called "everytown". it spans from 1936, when a war is on the horizon, to 2036, when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems.the first one hour is a bit slow - although it's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought. the events, suspense and visuals are pretty low-key in today's terms. however, when it gets to the future, it's just plain fun to watch. the large sets and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat.unless you have great listening abilities, this movie is hard to listen to. i think i understood only 80% of the dialog. it could use closed-captioning.if you're a sci-fi fan, this is one of the genre's classics and is a must see (well, at least after the first hour). for the average viewer, wait until there's a closed caption version and then watch it if you're comfortable with movies of this time period.

synopsis the future as seen from 1939 england. as war loomed over europe, the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past. it is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes.concept in relation to the viewer beware your leaders and what you are told. thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. there will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope.pros and cons i had seen this film long ago and recently downloaded it off of the internet (it is in the public domain). this is a fascinating work on numerous levels. since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939, it has obvious flaws. this vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical. this film was cutting edge for its day. the special effects are very good as is the story line. the acting suffers a bit in the british theatrical sense, in that it can lean a bit toward shakespeare.one of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know is not always true. the films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us.the underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film. the set design and wardrobe of "forbidden planet", the failings of technology in "2001: a space odessy", even the lush landscapes / cityscapes of "star wars" owe some amount of inspiration to this film.the ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed. while it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars, we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it. even as we reach, there are those that are trying to hold us back. this films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards. huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step.many great british actors are in this film as young men. cedric hardwicke and ralph richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here. raymond massey is a curious choice to play the lead character, cabel. his character almost comes across as the new christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science.this is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark.

this movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century, but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys, chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society, specifically when that technology is used for warfare.this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology, but as the circle completes itself, familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology.brilliant for it's time, the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some, but as a landmark in the history, development, and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must. in the end, free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed, the state ofsociety itself, as shaped by world events.those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so, but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains, as this film posits.as far as qualifying as sci-fi, one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it's speculative nature. it asks us the questions, what if these events happened this way, and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it? how would we react?as far as influence, this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions.

with such actors as ralph richardson, raymond massey, cedrick hardwicke, and margaretta scott, how can you go wrong. very unusual scenics, especially the modern ones. the realization of the modern machinery is very effective. here you have ray-gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area, so new structures can be made. although she's much younger in this film, it's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs. pumphrey from the bbc series, all creatures great and small is going to be! really effective "reappearance" of both raymond massey and ralph richardson. the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer, artur honegger and it is also unusual. for the time (1936) it looks like they used really, large sets or the effects make it seem that way. lastly, it's a really good story.

i have, "things to come," on d.v.d. and it's very clear compared to my vhs version. the audio is fair, but can be hard to understand at times. i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it.it gave details of why some things happened. the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first. such as, john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party, like it was a dive bomber, out dateing sea power by naming a battleship,"dinosuar." ships sunk by air-power, an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes. swept flying wing planes. strong rolls for the women through the entire movie. there are more, see the movie to enjoy them.

h.g. wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in 1935.very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades.great cast includes;raymond massey(arsenic and old lace) sir cedric hardwick(ghost of frankenstein)ralph richardson(time bandits) and margaretta scott.early glimpses of helicopters,holograms,a rocket ship,and futuristic cities.this film was ahead of its time.directed by william cameron menzies(invaders from mars)its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis(1927)but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come,that was made in 1979. this movie has nothing to do with the original.h.g. wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his stories.a classic science fiction movie.10 out of 10

amazing effects for a movie of this time. a primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of itself.a wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive.org. no charge, no sign up necessary. watch it in one sitting and you will be propelled.i plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as i had never heard of it before and i am a hard core sci fi fan.i would like to see how others react to this movie.watch it.rate it.tell us what you think.

things to come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's utopian ideals.raymond massey, cedric hardwicke, and ralph richardson make up a fine cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. there are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. however, there are some profound words there. is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? the film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. sure, hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. for the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. it has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema. they are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. there is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. these films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.

geniuses william cameron menzies and herbert george wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film, with ambition and scope hard to find today. they predict world war ii and the way great britain was attacked, and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. they change the timing; in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it's amazing. we even see an helicopter (the film is older than them).unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem romans with bubble-helmets: if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s, well's vision of a rationalistic society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and john cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it.9 1/2 out of 10. inspiring like that final monologue by john cabal.

this sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936. visually it is a wonder to behold, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress.this gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times.raymond massey and cedric hardwicke,both great actors,come off as quite a pair of fanatics. ralph richardson is very good as the "the boss" a megalomaniac warlord. the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. i'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie. there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes. although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be,this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it.

if scientists behaved in a way that h.g. wells was confident they would in the future, history wouldn't quite have turned out the way it did in things to come. were almost 80 years past the point that wells wrote the shape of things to come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before, in some ways farther away.though such well known players as raymond massey, ralph richardson, and cedric hardwicke are in the cast, they're more caricatures than real characters. it's the main weakness with the film, it's devoted to wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools.massey's characters, two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view. cedric hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward. and ralph richardson is a warlord arisen from the destruction of another thirty years war fought with modern weapons. by the way as the atomic bomb had not been invented, poison gas was deemed to be weapon that almost destroys mankind.according to wells, science and conquest can never mix. scientists as a group are far too above the world of politics to engage in such things. in wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of hitler and mussolini. those same folks however in order to defeat them, subordinated themselves to the allies and fashioned the atomic weapons that ushered in the modern age. if they behaved as wells would have liked them to, someone like albert einstein would have headed a junta of scientists who would have established a new order after world war ii. wells got it wrong both in time and in development. he apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power. computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment. still things to come, aided by the direction of william cameron menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of h.g. wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time though he didn't quite get right the shape of things to come.

the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians. the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources. it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement. it depicts a space gun/launcher and a helicopter, along with inventive mass communication devices, elevators, flat screen panels, and wireless intercoms. it's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future. but it portrays a child-like vision of boundless scientific/technological investigation.to me, it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozean-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government. the pro-progress characters (such as the two cabals) believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations, always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants.arthur c. clarke (author of 2001: a space odyssey) suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie. kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarke's suggestions (source: clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies. it has a beautiful menzies art design, but mediocre special effects (esp. the toy tanks).i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity. it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time. it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster. but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths. it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness:cabal: "too much {rest} and too soon, and we call it death. but for man no rest and no ending. he must go on--conquest beyond conquest. this little planet and its winds and ways, and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. then the planets about him, and at last out across immensity to the stars. and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time--still he will be beginning." cabal: "if we are no more than animals--we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass, mattering no more--than all the other animals do--or have done." {he points out at the stars.} "it is that--or this? all the universe--or nothingness..." (quotes from screenplay).if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress, then the council members (of the world government) will seem like technocrats. but actually those "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely, and they would have to be suppressed by government bans, laws against science and experiment, and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants.in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology, so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment. the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though, only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress.so it's also a story about the freedom to do science, just as much as it's about the wonders of progress. many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises, except in cases of social bias (many want to ban cloning, for example) or naturalism (some don't want us to progress freely, and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth) or fear/reason (some believe we aren't ready for advanced science/technology since we might destroy ourselves). but cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the problem of danger: "our {scientific} revolution did not abolish death or danger. it simply made death and danger worth while" (screenplay).

h.g. wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by. he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour. at the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species, natural biology, on one side, and marxism, market economy on the other side, were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number. the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite. he defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race. first of all the non-caucasian, with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages. then, within the caucasian community all those who were not healthy, the alcoholics, the mentally disabled, all those who were genetically disabled, etc. that was not hitler. that was h.g. wells and that was not after the first world war. that was more than ten years before. and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that defended the idea that the human "race", left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth, would see the differentiation of the human "race" into two "species": the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species. the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators. wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy. the first countries to follow this injunction were the scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them. the film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election, no parliament, no really democratic institution, only peace imposed by military conquest, and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors. and in that future world all, absolutely all human beings are caucasians. wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036. amazing. wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all. the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets. frightening. and that was produced in 1936. all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of hitlerism, fascism, japanese imperialism or stalinism can be found. but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h.g. wells. we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute "democratic" social selection, or the animal farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat, or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of big brother. this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others. and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days. it would be unfair to go beyond. this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals: the fear that the future would only be somber, bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

i first saw this film 40 years ago on n.y. television, and thought it was a depressing look at the future. wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing. (" no private airplanes". the 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to british film goers doing the war. the concept of the future, and the korda an co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film. the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss. a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series. it is interesting to note that the boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time churchill.

saw it first in 1975 on some german tv channel and was hooked immediately, afterwards i saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays i have a videotape which i watch at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every aspect (direction, acting, cut, musical score...). the sets are outstanding and very impressive, the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "everytown" is pure mussolini and raymond massey is just charming, believable and ideally cast as "the hero". the positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes, even after watching the film so many times.this movie is good on tv but it was made for the big screen, so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema. please do, it's overwhelming.

i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed, with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax. what cinema goers made of this in the 30s, i can only imagine. the 'times' said at the time, 'a miracle has come to the screen.' watch it and marvel.

things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows an imagined world, or "everytown" through 100 years. you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the "boss" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again, after everytown was bombed and war broke out.this film only has about 3 faults: it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren't deep at all, and the overall plot isn't altogether solid. the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on... it just seems a little "fluffy." but if you love sci-fi and are interested in what h.g. wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.

the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. when war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed. adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the "wandering sickness", a pestilence that continues for another four years."things to come" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. the "wings over the world" concept plays out a bit corny, though it's spokesman cabal (raymond massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. if he fails, others will follow. this message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in massey's end of movie speech. man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an "all the universe or nothing" mindset.the film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film "metropolis". as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969."things to come" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? it's not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.

i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year. i was enthralled and entertained. it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci-fi story, in a book or on the screen. there's social commentary, speculation, and a good story.there's something eerie, and amusing, watching a 1936 view of the 'distant future' of the 60s and 70s.i think it's a must see, and not only for sci-fiers.

"things to come" movie review by kwricehere is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place. it is a film i've only seen in truncated parts, but art should be taken as a whole. i experienced this film as it was designed, in a darkened theatre, on a silver screen, with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with. that audience and myself were effected by this film! one woman who lived through ww ii was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive, albeit corny, ending.the things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits. the first thing we see is "h.g. wells" in bold angular block copy much like the "superman" of yore. it is not the film title, but the creator's title, and then before any other humans, such as actors or production, are listed, the director william cameron menzies is up there! who? you've probably seen his work before, "around the world in 80 days," "pride of the yankees," and "gone with the wind." he did not direct after this sci-fi epic opera he and mr. wells created, but his film imagery, sets, and design are very recognizable.that imagery is very effecting. i recognized images from many other films, that have paid homage to this classic. the recent "hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy" is obvious, along with bugs bunny, "fantasia," "monty python and the holy grail," "sky captain & the world of tomorrow," "night of the living dead" and more that i know of, but which titles escape me. this is real special effects here, scenes now done with cgi are done with actors, big sets, and detailed models. this film was made in 1936, and it's obvious it meant something to the other auteurs. wells and menzies also worked with bliss, doing the music, and korda, the producer, to create a masterpiece with message, warning, and sermon.the lines the shakespearean actors cedric hardwicke, ralph richardson and raymond massey speak, sometimes sound preachy, but i also heard lines i still hear now. "these toys children have nowadays are nothing like i had when i was child," "it'll help develop their coordination," "what do we need books for, what do we need to read for?", "we don't need cars, there's nowhere to go, we have all we need right here," "there will be no war." but war there is! the naive citizens of "everytown" refuse to see the literal writing on the wall. the never-ending war explodes christmas eve. the little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me. this is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to hitler's appeasement. this war does not end. the poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act.it is another dark age. no government, no services, and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about. plague, warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists. loved ones are shot in the street, before they can carry the plague to another. midway there is a marvelous vignette about the rolls royce, that is a much needed respite mid-way. into this lands a futuristic plane that heralds the future.that future is the third act. the world has rebuilt itself with the help of that "puny animal, man." helicopters fly in this film, before they were even invented. the plumber's helper has other uses than the dalek's or glenn miller's. wide screen plasma screens beguiling the masses, and orators inciting the people to tear it all down. "beware the concussion, you have been warned!", the city father warns the riotous populace. so be warned, this film might hit you like it hit me. there are some cute miscues and miscalculations, but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again, and i do want to see this artful film again. others criticize mr. wells vision. it is very easy to work with 20/20 hindsight regarding things, costumes and foley miscues. i believe mr. wells' "things to come" is not about things, but is actually about concepts, social trends, and philosophical ideals. besides, we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come. this is not cheap cardboard british science fiction, but worthwhile epic filmed opera, sans singing, that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings.

aside from the great movie metropolis, this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie. while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad, it is a great film for two reasons. first, it is extremely original in both style and content. even in the 21st century, there are no films i can think of that are anything like it. second, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible--using matte paintings, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. sure, you could sit back and knock the film because, by today's standards, the effects are only so-so. but, you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences. in many ways, the sets look highly reminiscent of the "modern cities" featured at the 1939 world's fair.i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question "are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness?" the end result seems to be a little of both! how true!a final note: i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video. all three times the sound and print quality stank--particularly the sound. if this is available on a dvd, hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning. as the sound on the video kept cutting out, i really would have appreciated this!

things to come is that rarity of rarities, a film about ideas. many films present a vision of the future, but few attempt to show us how that future came about. the first part of the film, when war comes to everytown, is short but powerful. (ironically, film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england--appeasement was at its height. wells' prediction was borne out all too soon.) the montage of endless war that follows, while marred by sub-par model work, is most effective. the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design. the art director was the great william cameron menzies, and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work. margaretta scott is very seductive as the chief's mistress. the everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling--perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970. unfortunately, the model work, representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways, is laughably bad and could have been done much better, even with 30s technology. this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing. this is redeemed by raymond massey's magnificent speech that concludes the film--rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well. massey's final question is more relevant now than ever, in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight. the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss, whose last name i proudly share.unfortunately, the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film.

i must admit a slight disappointment with this film; i had read a lot about how spectacular it was, yet the actual futuristic sequences, the age of science, take up a very small amount of the film. the sets and are excellent when we get to them, and there are some startling images, but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards...much the best drama of the piece is in the mid-section, and then it plays as melodrama, arising from the 'high concept' science-fiction nature of it all, and insufficiently robust dialogue. there is far more human life in this part though, with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator, the "boss" of the everytown. i loved richardson's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines, dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey's aloof, confident visitor. this boss is a posturing, convincingly deluded figure, unable to realise the small-fry nature of his kingdom... it's not a great role, yet richardson makes a lot of it.everytown itself is presumably meant to be england, or at least an english town fairly representative of england. interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things; the 'things to come' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal, but to just go on and on. there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section, concerning more personal 'life', yet one is left quite unsatisfied. the film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities; it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle, blunt moralism, every time. and, of course, recall the hedged-bet finale: raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are! concerning the question of the film being a prediction: i must say it's not at all bad as such, considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right. the grander conceptions have something to them; a war in 1940, well that was perhaps predictable... lasting nearly 30 years, mind!? a nuclear bomb - the "super gun" or some such contraption - in 2036... a technocratic socialist "we don't believe in independent nation states"-type government, in britain, after 1970... hmmm, sadly nowhere near on that one, chaps! ;-) no real politics are gone into here which is a shame; all that surfaces is a very laudable anti-war sentiment. generally, it is assumed that dictatorship - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist, as under the boss, or all-hands-to-the-pump scientific socialism - will *be the deal*, and these implications are not broached... while we must remember that in 1936, there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out - or even how they were turning out - the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers' vision on other matters.much of the earlier stuff should - and could - have been cut in my opinion; only the briefest stuff from '1940' would have been necessary, yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous, and it is ages before we get to the richardson-massey parts. i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott; who is just a trifle sceptical, cutting a flashing-eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose. the character is not explored, or frankly explained or exploited, except for one scene which i shall not spoil, and her relationship with the boss isn't explored; but then this was the 1930s, and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then. edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles; more so in the first as a hapless chap, praying for war, only to be bluntly put down by another massey character. massey himself helps things a lot, playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto, contrasting well with a largely diffident cast, save for richardson, and scott and chapman, slightly.i would say that "things to come" is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936; one of the few serious british science fiction films to date, indeed! its set (piece) design and harnessing of resources are ravenous, marvellous. yet, the script is ultimately over-earnest and, at times, all over the place. the direction is prone to a flatness, though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion. the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however; respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology, and an engaging, jerky performance that consistently beguiles. such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing; powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this - they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers, great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate."things to come", as it stands, is an intriguing oddity, well worth perusing, yet far short of a "metropolis"... 'tis much as "silly", in wells' words, as that lang film, yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it.

while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind, this is still a stunning film that presages the science-fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen. it predicts the global chaos of wwii, but expands on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years, and then tells the epic tale of man's struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space. the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile, but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie's release, and which still impress today. this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre.

i first saw this as a child living in east london. the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street. i remember having nightmares after seeing it. the odd thing is, it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction. apart from a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was badly awry, more nano-technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-crafted work. it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then. i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. however, much was right. mans desire for war, mans inhumanity to man. the means of war as a catalyst for development. 

this early sci-fi masterwork by herbert george wells with music by arthur bliss is a powerful piece of film-making. adapted from wells' somewhat different work by the author, it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of 'peace'. the structure is that after a contrasted-pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war, the script allows the war to happen. two families, the cabells and the passworthys disagree about what may happen; passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization's "automatic" progress; cabell is the thinker, the doubter. their city everytown--obviously london-- becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks, a magnificent war march by bliss, and the end of civilization. the second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a "boss", played with bravura by ralph richardson, whose woman, lovely margaretta scott, is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete-bound dictator type. he is trying to rebuild old wwi airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom; a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes--etc.--everlastingly; this is wells' comment on war versus progress. the survivors are subject to a plague called "the wandering sickness" also. enter a modern flying machine piloted by the cabell of the first section of the film, now part of wings over the world, an international scientists' coalition, who are planning to end warfare forever. this flight-suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the boss and his woman, their attraction being evident; then boss sends up his aircraft against them, the scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the "gas of peace" onto the ruins of everytown. only the boss dies, fighting too hard against the pacifying. the film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers. in section three, a future cabell argues with a future passworthy over the morality of human science. passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the moon; cabell champions man's right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons. the son of passworthy and cabell's daughter, are the astronauts being sent. theotocopulos, a religious-minded luddite, makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city's forum and leads an attack on the 'space gun' that is to fire the new rocket free of earth's gravity. the climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully; the denouement and ending is a speech by cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned. "it is all the universe--or nothing!" cabell tells passworthy. "which shall it be?" as cabell, raymond massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance; he is thoughtful, compassionate, and reasonable, a true scientist. as the rabble-rouser who wants to end the age of science, cedric hardwicke is perfect and powerful. edward chapman playing passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear. the storyline is logical, frequently beautiful and always interesting. given the near-extinction of mankind, the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer. this is a triumph for the director, william cameron menzies, for bliss and for all concerned. listen to the dialogue with someone you love; within its constructed limits, this is a thinking man's drama debating two possible human futures--progress or its reactionary opposite.

the korean war has been dubbed americas's forgotten war. so many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there. occasionally, we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far-off, ghostly frozen graveyard. here is perhaps one of the finest. it's called " sergeant ryker. " the story is of an american soldier named sgt. paul ryker (lee marvin) who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer. his task is to defect to the north koreans and offer his services against united nations forces. so successful is his cover, he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of major. however, he is thereafter captured by the americans, put on trial as a traitor and spy. stating he was ordered to defect, he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence. he is convicted and sentenced to hang. however, his conviction is doubted by capt. young (bradford dillman), his prosecutor. convincing commanding gen. amos baily, (lloyd nolan) of his doubts, he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed. the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves, murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt. max winkler. korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950's. due to its superior script and powerful message, this drama has become a courtroom classic. excellent viewing and recommended to all. ****

sergeant ryker is accused of being a traitor during the korean war, a hanging offense. a long drawn out court-marshal ensues during which time the sgt. must remain in a military jail. after much investigation the defense attorney attempts to exonerate the doomed non-com with an eleventh hour ploy. very good picture.

engaging, riveting tale of captured us army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman. paul ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a us spy on a secret mission in korea.in the vein of classic courtroom dramas, "sergeant ryker" is an extremely well crafted mystery, ably guided by an outstanding cast, director kulik's constant momentum, and effective plot twists and turns.this film was originally made as a television movie in 1964, and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many "name" actors, and some action sequences. dillman, reprising his role, is spot-on as the doubting defence attorney, whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of ryker's supportive, yet somewhat distant wife, played with aplomb by vera miles. rounding out the frontline is peter graves for the prosecution, and norman fell and murray hamilton in key supporting roles.marvin's interpretation of the paul ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he's placed. marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference, to passionate determination, giving a convincing, often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama. it's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best-ever lists of courtroom dramas.however, despite its apparent obscurity, "sergeant ryker" still remains a taut and compelling examination, like a book that you just can't put down. highly recommended.

at first i didn't like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama.but after buying it and seeing it, it wasn't that bad. i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing. now i understand. the radio show was a super propaganda radio program. ilse , johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories. the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels,in berlin and hamburg, and record sales only. this is why ilse wasn't allowed to sing in this picture. this would be made up by medium budget musical ,were making music, 1942, in which she would demonstrate her whistling.but this is an excellent example propaganda.inge and her aunt eichhorn,played by ida wust, goes to the 1936 olympics. the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets. she meets carle radditz, who plays herbert, who has an extra ticket. she goes with him and it's love at first sight. they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side.carl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain. when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking.you see the nazi soldiers acting normal,like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs. this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism. the character was a butcher now soldier . this was a subtle put down against meat eating.late on in world war 11, herbert is flying in a german airplane. we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over. we shoot his plane. they crash. unfortunately for us they survive.another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church ,now it's putting the catholics down, and hubert's best friend helmet,played by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ, beethtoven, .more bombs come in from us. the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he's being told to leave. we end up injuring him. propaganda message? the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it.it injured him. see? by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma, played hedwig bleibteu, the same german grandame actress who played maria holst's aunt in weiner blut.well ,later it comes to the short view of the radio show. this was not intended to be a musical revue, such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol, the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop. it was mainly a war romantic movie.it's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause, cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive. after the war many of them who survive would regret it. this is a good swastika classic. the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads, who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their. they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity . be careful most of the time it's the direct hate only classics. if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it ,then its a nazi website skip it .go to ihf or german wartime films dot com, amazon dot dee or german video dot net. they are legitimate. 01/23/10 mada a mistake it wasn't herbert's friend that got killed at the church . it was malte yager's character's friend schartzscop.

a true story about a true revolution, 25 of april ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years, that was imposing a colonial war on it's military's, for maintaining an empire (angola, mozambique, guine-bissau, cabo verde, s. tomé e principe; the first and the last of the great colonial empire's of europe) of 600 years, since it's beginning in the conquest of ceuta in 1415; a revolution by the army for the people, and for a democratic portugal; the most's surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it (except those that died in the hand's of pide, the political police of the state, during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it's headquarters in the day of the revolution, in 25 of april 1974, has it show's on the film).and has all revolutions it has it's heroes, one them of was captain salgueiro maia, a returned soldier from the war, whose convictions along with the rest of the army, was that they were fighting (since 1961) a hopeless war, and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it's country.

principally it is the story of two men who were part of the portuguese revolution. it was easy to understand the contest, but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else, or they shows also the period before or after this fact, here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts. it could also be seen as a kind of documentary. the movie focalize to these two people, showing as normal they were, not like common heroes, because the revolution come from people. although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just "capitaes" as the main characters. nice colors and lights during the whole movie, excellent work for the director being her first movie, she doesn't fall to the banal way. well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. the character of maia (main one)is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for stefano accorsi, able to show maia's limits, this not-being an hero.

you know? our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... i can explain, i think!! well... until that happen on 25th april 1974, our freedom was limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! that's all a consequence of the revolution! i think that's clear!... about the movie... i think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies it's quite good!! i like it very much!

"capitães de abril" is a very good. the story isn't a documentary about the 1974 revolution in portugal. but it gives us an idea of how it was like. the fiction of the story isn't of great interest, but it doesn't spoil the movie. the heroic actions of captain salgueiro maia aren't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds. captain salgueiro maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th of april revolution.all the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. lisbon looks beautiful as ever. don't miss it! i liked this film very much.

being half-portuguese doesn't render me half-blind (nor half-prejudiced) when discussing portuguese films. not that i get to do that very often anyway. but this film was such a rush of adrenaline! yes, that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went/goes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory: things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. and by god did they get it right! ok, to sum it up: very emotional if you've lived through it, but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were. if you're just watching it randomly, you're in for a good historical romp, only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual. even by european standards, yes.

probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life, and i enjoyed it. the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. mozambique, angola, and guinea (bissau)- cape vert. most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including spinola, who took over as the new president. the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
