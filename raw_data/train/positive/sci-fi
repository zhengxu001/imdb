this one and "her pilgrim soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone. as i mentioned in my comment on the new series, there's something lacking in this new series. maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned. it's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling's version. however, this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too. i think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite. i remember i wasn't surprised by the korean movie "il mare" (later remade into "the lake house". i think it's because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film.

this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories (i note both of them are based on short stories). "examination day" is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves, huge tv-looking "phones" that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age...and the examination day, a point where 12-year-olds must undergo a government-required iq test. the kid is this story, dickie jordan (david mendenhall) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades. his parents (christopher allport and elizabeth norment), on the other hand, say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score, and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry, it's pretty obvious they are worried. i won't give anything away in the ending, but i will say this - there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject: that evening (or another?) his parents ask dickie whether he'd prefer to watch tv all night. by today's standards, we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching...but why would his family ask this? the flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon (which i hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen). i only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was. i found it to be better than the short story it was based on. i haven't read the one that "a message from charity" was based on, but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year-ld boy, peter (robert duncan mcneill) is suffering a fever from unclean water, that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown...but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever, charity payne, (kerry noonann) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him. they both recover, especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985, but the connection doesn't go away. charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company, especially peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he's been staying in one place at. things take an unexpected turn, though, when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever (not so common in 1700). the two try to learn a way to save her. the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching. both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lesson/warning that sounds like something rod sterling would've cooked up and entertainment, make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship, love, and wisdom do a great deal. probably 3/4 of this has no theme, but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling's crew.

remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. the boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. a corker of a concluding scene! a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.

but sadly due to rights issues, that almost certainly will never happen. transcripts of joe bob's commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet, but they don't quite capture his twang inflected delivery, which was a real hoot. nowadays, joe bob (real name: john bloom) is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as "i spit on your grave" (featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time), and jason x, one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time (the series was never the same once it left paramount). all i could think when they canceled it was: "damn, where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping, blonde jokes, and horror trivia every saturday night? does this mean i have to get a life now?" sadly, it does. but there'll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for "monstervision." long live the drive-in!

monstervision was a show i grew up with. from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one, the only, joe bob briggs. the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years, and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the drive-in.without a doubt, the best late night television ever. if you didn't stay up, you were missing out.i know john bloom and joe bob live on, but i want them back where they belong...monstervision! question...did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of "the swarm" ? q:)long live monstervision!

i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993. i was 8 at the time, and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it.the 90's all of a sudden seem so far away, what a great decade. anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time, as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films. it was like the 90's version of chiller theater. if mst3k can get dvd's why not joe bob's show, at least monstervision was more interesting and informative. a lot of joe bob's comments and info on the films were just hilarious. most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen. many were oddball flicks that you wouldn't see anywhere else like the the japanese sci-fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell. with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors, i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up, since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show. i'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day, i guess will have to wait and see. until then "thats great television"!

spacecamp is my favorite movie. it is a great story and also inspires others.the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie. it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie.the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up. i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school; i also know a close friend of the late pilot.i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach.i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up. i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers,"invisible", going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result, so i'm much closer to the accident and any movie similarities. i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later, strangely enough, on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour.

spacecamp is a movie that i plan to show my daughter julia ann ruth morgan some day. seeing joaquin phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a roman emperor in the film gladiator. i am pleased to say that i now have comms with the artificial intelligence of qe2 who said that i was young and that is true. holodeck comms with my daughter on coaltrain came through coaltrain gate julia ann glow "hide daddy". the fact that my daughters artificial intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace to the friendly ki alien creators of humans may not have been taken to a an american bunker in time. we have the power to change the future with faster than light comms. i order that my ex wife and daughter julia ann ruth morgan be taken to an american bunker as soon as possible. my daughter julia is 23rd in command of the planet earth and a bridge officer. she already said that she doesn't like bullies. having had someone steal her gameboy and gauntlet ii game from my mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys. julia has been growing up fast. the time of jfk and qe2 starting life over again on this planet is not until 2023. julia would be a young lady by then and her artificial intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon. if i have to go to a bunker to continue the american leadership then i am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority. president jack kennedys artificial intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop global warming at any time. thanks boss thats similar to my daughter julias ai telling me hide and stay indoors. kate capshaw is now married to steven spielberg. wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses. if you value freedom of speech like president kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer. check out joaquin phoenixs other movies also.

hurrah! a space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp. the film starts slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup. but when the going gets tough - the tough get themselves sorted out and it's not an un-believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds.the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the "i'm right and you're all wrong" instructor. i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote.

this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever!i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish, but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit "like super cool" with a "like totally bitchin" belt and stick on rhinestones on her face.but anyways, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that holds your interest. i know that the begining drags, particuarly if you know what is going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film.i wouldn't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie, in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself, but i'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind.

spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, and mom and dad can have fun watching as well. growing up in the 80's i enjoyed this movie, it's plot and all the actors. i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own, they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did. the plot is fun, a group of kids, embark on a journey they never expected, when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot. they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in. once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life.

i've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality. this film was meant to be a 'fantasy'....a 'what if' fun film. it was never meant to be 'real' or serious. it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion...i was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - my young son loved it too! later, i shared it with my daughter and she, too, loved it. spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun. all the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp (one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...i guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. oh well. if you love fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one, i highly recommend it! enjoy!

this is one of those feel good, saturday afternoon movies. it's right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator. just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up. and it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson. not to mention joquin phoenix.i personally really like movies like this from time to time. nothing too deep or too scary. just a nice story line. and i would have never known mr. phoenix had i not recently read the credits. he was just a baby really when he made this movie.kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too. she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie. i agree it's not an oscar caliber movie. but very much worth watching. especially if you have kids in the , let's say, 8 to 11 year old range. or ones that are interested in the space program.

space camp is a pretty decent film. the plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time.this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster, and that really put a hamper on how popular it was.the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular... on the big screen, that is... on a tv... it just looks average. i remember this scene in the theater. it made you feel like you were really up there.this would be a good film to see on imax, but i'm sure that will never happen.

to my surprise i quite enjoyed 'spacecamp', i remember seeing it about 13 years ago, and recently i hired it again. i was quite impressed. obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp. however, this film had a story- a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it. but thats what i liked about it- they don't make films like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. it was interesting to see kelly preston, leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles, with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot. absolutely loved the robot named jinx, it was very cute, but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters. the film was almost inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama (i think).

this is a family film, which to some people is an automatic turn off. it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs, gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book. this film is none of those. it is cliché, it is formula, but it is also fun. it doesn't ask you to think, it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality. it simply does what a good film ought to do, which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. the cast is good, while not excellent. as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was, as usual, excellent. and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable. it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster, which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening, but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein. so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy.

the perfect space fantasy film. a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down, but do they, sure they do.this would not be a family film if they all died. then it will all be sad. you don't want that kate capsaw, the leading lady gives a golden globe performance, but sadly, she nor lea thompson won one. that sucks so bad.i can't say it enough, this film is so great, lea thompson- o lord, a perfect girl for this film. this film is the best for sure. sorry, but better than star wars. star wars is so over- rated and space camp was so under- rated. it should of been the other way aroundexcellent 10/10- 0r maybe 11/10. iam not good at math

a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot. and the oxygen in ship was running short. they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks, etc, etc.first of all, this movie's plot is not possible in real life. but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in.it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years. (i saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000, it was filmed in 1986) there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood.the view was great from outer space. it does not look unreal. it is about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you won't even notice. you know that it is not real, but you just get sucked into it until the end.overall, it is a good family movie.

unfortunately, spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion. which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should, bring it out. i'm glad they did. i first watched spacecamp at a drive-in movie. which really enhanced the viewing a lot.while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt. i had never heard of the others in the movie. so, it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting, and acting real good! of course, kate capshaw was excellent too.i especially liked the scenes, where those kids were being shown how to act, as a team. the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for. the actual launch of a spacecraft, is of course, old news to us. however, this one was different.all in all, this is one of my most treasured films. escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a space nut like me. after probably renting it for 30 - 40 times. i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it. now, if it only comes out on dvd. i will probably have it forever. this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me.

i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch. they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team.another scene is like during their failure at the simulation, kevin gets joaquin to clam down.i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff.otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff.the dvd i have watched feels edited for television.

i could see this film is super he didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth, this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory, right?very i liked watching this film when i was the child. i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really, certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense. who at healthy senses, sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit. i very like reading for the subject, american and soviet space programs. i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows?

watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories . i'm 34 now, have not seen it since i was 12-14. i had almost forgotten about this movie, but when i watched it again recently, some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye! that little robot "jinx"(friends for ever!). it was just like revisiting my childhood. it was an absolutely amazing experience for me. i will always cherish this movie for that reason. i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience, not for this particular movie, but any movie you have not seen in a long while. very nostalgic...-thanks for reading

trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn't yet seen. renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse. my son is so jaded with current "b" science fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet.it must be noted i didn't see anything about cypher when it was released in australia. it must have been very quiet or i just missed it.well this was a really pleasant surprise! this is also no b movie. it's not a "blockbuster" of the epic variety and doesn't try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it's plot to be fully savoured.the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view, but they get it right at it's 2nd appearance, & that aside everything else is top notch. in any case the affects are secondary.i won't give anything away about the plot. the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct (though with very different content).just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke. the actor was born in cambridge england, and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect, it's a tad off key. see the final twist of the plot and you'll see why that is such a brilliant choice! and lucy liu is also just right with her "will she kiss me - will she shoot me" edge.i rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them.

don't read anything about this movie (especially nothing that could contain any spoilers). just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience. if you like to see an intelligent, twisted story: go, get the dvd and you'll truly not be disappointed. "cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business. it's about corporate secrets, how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them. the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness. cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what belongs the story and the ending - also much, much more satisfying than vincenzo natali's other movies "cube" and "nothing". actually it's one of the best movies i've ever seen (and that's something i really don't say this about every fifth well-made flick). sorry, can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience. just give it a chance. ;-)

"cypher" is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future. while thematically not complex, this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty, ruthlessness, and corporate conspiracy. to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf.the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man, morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative. after an initial briefing with digicorp's security chief, sullivan is then given a new identity (jack thursby) and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies. upon successfully completing his first assignment, sullivan/thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered. however, on one of his "business trips" he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster, (liu) whom he had met on his previous assignment, and from there things go extremely topsy-turvy. the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp's espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp's main competitors, thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies.((spoilers end here))what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes. vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic/household settings, while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover-up. i was also very impressed with jeremy northam. not too often have i seen him in the lead role, and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant. personally, i think he's one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn't been given more challenging roles. lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak-and-dagger tone. additionally, the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job, however, my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated. for example, i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second "wife." overall, this is a cleverly developed cloak-and-dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted. with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work, this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future. i'm surprised that i had never watched this "hidden gem" before. this is a brilliant, not-too-overly complicated spy thriller, and therefore i'm giving it a 9 out of 10.

cypher is a clever, effective and eerie film that delivers. its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands. although one could immediately label the film a science fiction, there is a little more to it. it has it's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir/detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story.the film, overall, plays out like it's some kind of nightmare; thus building and retaining a good atmosphere. we're never sure of what exactly is going on, we're never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we're not entirely sure of certain people, similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i haven't seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before, bar terry gilliam's brazil. going with the eeriness stated earlier, cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective, noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there's something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well.there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story. the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster (liu), who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale, can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero: people whom appear as friends actually aren't, people who say they're helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look. despite a lot of switching things around, twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they're not carried out; the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu's character  and she's trying to help out(!) the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage, spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents. the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini-cold war; something that resembles the u.s.a. and the u.s.s.r. in their war of word's heyday and it really pulls through given the black, bleak, often cgi littered screen that i was glued to. what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and foster's own motivation this sequence disappears because he's breaking away from the computerised, repetitive, controlled life that he's being told to live and is branching out.cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film. to say it resembles the first jason bourne film, only set in the sci-fi genre, isn't cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities; despite them both being released in the same year. like i mentioned earlier, there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict, you will find yourself enjoying this film.

cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill sci-fi flick. the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. the close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. the sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. the technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, however, the director makes good use of the props. the character development is intentionally shallow. the main character, jeremy northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. it's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end.

damn, i've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still don't get bored watching it.the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me.the cgis are quite bad imho, but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just... just a genius perfect combination for such a movie. the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good.however although, the movie had little flaws, like e.g. sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too "slow", but i don't mean the scenic parts by that, i totally loved those.also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story, like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps, where all their data is saved, and has this conversation with the guy down there... but that may also just be me :d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized, they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and "louder" but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again...

this movie is a gem because it moves with soft, but firm resolution.i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there, it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace. it's not about explosions, car chases, or flying bullets. you must be patient and instead, note the details here. it's sedate because that's what the main character is. the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds.i will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching. the plot is what you've read from the other postings: an average white-collar guy, seeking change and adventure, signs on for a corporate spy job. just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data. take it from there.this movie starts at a surreal walk-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential, underlying suburban paranoia.then it begins to accelerate.the acting on all parts is superb-- and yes, some of the acts are caricature characters. but they all fit, and they entertain. and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft, soft key sinister theme: all is not right at the beginning.and at the end: all is not what it seems.get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one-- and turn up the sound: this movie wants you to listen.

this is my first comment! this is a fantastic movie! i watched it all by luck one night on tv. at first 5 minutes i thought it was a b movie, but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was.i suggested to some friends to see the movie, only to tell me that it was a bad b movie. how wrong. superficial critiques.i think that the movie is almost a product of genius! the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time.

i've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot. but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now, and i wan tell it's one the best movies i've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!! what you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie, if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end. the end is what makes this movie so good, you can't expect it.congratulations to the producer !

who can watch a movie, look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed. that woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress. that's a tough combination to find now a days. and jeremy northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. my advice to hollywood is : "use him more".now about the movie: i watched it in one of my graveyard shift. i don't recommend that to anyone. it's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming. i'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this is spoilment enough.now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. i love the dark mystic story, the actors did a good job & i love the directors (natali) work in the past. there's not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty risky. you know what, i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this. then again, 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement.

wow. one of the greatest movies i have ever - ever seen.absolutely loved it! before the opening credits were done i was glued to the screen.it's a sci-fi thriller - and edge of your seat whodunnit. incredible.i wish'd it would never end.lucy liu is a throwaway role. anyone could have played it. the lead actor, jeremy northram was the perfect geeky guy. this movie appeals to me who loved war games, sneakers, and track down.incredible!8-22-06. walt d in lv

it's actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond, as i'm sure he wouldn't be able to keep up in the nowadays spying-business, where fast cars have been replaced with hi-tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment. "cypher" is a pretty inventive sci-fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible. you know the trend in these types of movies: nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot, the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again. the events in "cypher" supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world, where the major companies don't really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other's thunder. company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity, only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor, the sunways corporation. sunways, on the other hand, constantly tries to unmask the digisoft-rats and recruit them again as double-spies. in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan; a seemingly colorless thirty-something employee who's been selected by sebastian rooks (the über-spy) to diddle the secret policies of both companies. trust me, it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali (the dude from "tube") carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters. the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem "seconds"  starring rock hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style. even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60's film, with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless. there's also plenty of great action and suspense, most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing-techniques during boring conventions. the middle section of the film drags a little, mainly because you already realize that it's all just building up towards multiple misleading plot-twists, and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not-so-distant future. jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side. regular director's choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c. dunn. "cypher" is well made and adrenalin rushing sci-fi entertainment, highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time.

this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp. this wimpy guy, morgan (jeremy northam) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy. he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies' plans. instead, morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by lucy liu) and pretty much being double-crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent. how will morgan get himself out of this? can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster (played by lucy liu)? and more importantly, can morgan make it out alive? wow! what a nifty movie! i was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie. it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgan's fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive. the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgan's head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening. morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished. from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man actively fighting for his life.the ending, wow, the ending is incredible! the twist is so much fun! it left me gasping and cheering like crazy! good performances from all around, especially from jeremy natham, lucy liu and nigel bennett.i highly recommend this film!

if you came into the film with expectations, throw them away now, because no amount of hype will do this film justice.to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal. it's a spy thriller, has elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative, mind-bending plot twists, and gorgeous cinematography.a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative, both in good and bad ways, of other movies. but as they say, every story cribs from shakespeare, so once you can get past that, you're in for a hell of a ride.you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are portions (read: the elevator) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals. don't misconstrue that to mean it's on the same level as cheesy sci-fi channel movies, though, because this is on a much higher level.if you're looking for action, you should turn away. this is pure psychology. but if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience, by all means, do it now! watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it!

canadian director vincenzo natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube, which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s. it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. i've been eagerly awaiting natali's follow-up, and although its taken five years for him to mount another project, i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait. cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world, and how through a completely logical chain of events, finds himself in a situation beyond his control.i don't want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down. it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head. cypher is such a film.morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet, is hired by the company digicorp. they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars. to his bewilderment, they are unbelievably boring. covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.while morgan is waiting for one seminar, he runs into rita foster (an impeccably cast lucy liu), the definition of an ice maiden. she gives him the brush-off, but there is something to her he finds irresistible. that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in. when rita turns up at another one of morgan's seminars, she tells him his life is not what it appears. and i'm not saying anything more about the plot. to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us, as well as the tortuous path that's so much fun to follow.as with cube, natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown. and cypher follows similar patterns. but it's not a carbon copy of cube. it has it's own inspiration.cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge. when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him.one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is. where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns, cypher is also on a low budget, but natali economises it as much as he can, allowing him to broaden the horizon, and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity.natali's direction is exceptional, with a deft hand on the reins. there are some amazing camera angles from above, such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast, robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside. all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture, which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir.the acting is uniformly excellent throughout. jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity. his performance is excellent because it's so modulated. he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes. from a clinical, spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity.david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube. he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black. his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia. he is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents, and it's a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly acted by hewlett. all he has to do is look at morgan, and we're drawn into his complex mind game.but it's lucy liu who's the scene stealer here. too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect. but in cypher, she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove. rita is an aloof, guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish. i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control, and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone.things come to a very gratifying end, that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did. but morgan deserves his happy ending. after he's been put through the ringer like this, i cheered for him in the final scene. it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes.cypher succeeds on all counts. engaging, shocking, always entertaining, it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't. and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix.a fine follow-up from natali. and now i'm a committed fan of the man. superb stuff!

director vincenzo natali's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which, although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration, manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience.morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife, decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high-tech company digi corp. his job is to travel to conferences across the country (under the assumed identity of jack thursby) and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses, via a nifty little electronic pen-gizmo.in reality, however, the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities. morgan, along with his fellow conference attendees, is being brainwashed. the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma, during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities. once they are totally convinced that they are someone else, they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies, where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion.but digi corp's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire rita foster (lucy liu), who opens morgan's eyes to what is really happening. she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques. she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby, then he will be 'eliminated'. morgan plays along, and applies for a job at rival business sunways.however, arriving at his new workplace, he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy. fortunately, the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent.from hereon in, things get progressively more complicated; the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone. in an exciting finale, all eventually becomes clear (but only if you've been following events very carefully).director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget. he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast; jeremy northam,in particular, is fantastichis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection.cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects, high rise and necropolis.

listen, i don't care what anybody says, as cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie. cypher is not, i repeat not, a b movie. cypher is an absolute masterpiece. suffice it to say, i am a connoisseur of the world's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight. i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is. cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made. the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime. in fact, i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me. in fact, i've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. other critics, of whom some downplayed the movie, have no idea as to what the hell they're talking about. don't listen to the haters. and actually, for the most part, reviews of cypher have been largely positive. and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie, but it is also a fantastic movie. cypher is the kind of movie that's so advanced and so magnificently crafted, that it's over the heads of most critics and all the cynics. there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever. again, the cinematography, the backdrops, the technology, the storyline, and the acting are all 100% world-class top notch. naturally, i won't give anything away. this is not a spoiler. and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters, i believe quite the opposite. cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way. cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves. blade runner, 1984, brave new world, total recall, logan's run, jason bourne and impostor and deja vu... look out! cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research, 5 star eternal spy movie hall of fame. cypher is counterespionage at it's absolute best. hands down and hats off. nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. the future is now.

in a near future, the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan (jeremy northam) is hired by digicorp, a huge corporation, to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors, sunways. along his training, morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures. in one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster (lucy liu), who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be. morgan acknowledges a new reality, where he does not know who can be trusted.the unknown "cypher" was a great surprise for me. this movie has not been released in brazil, but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex, with many plot points, and with great screenplay, direction and performances. in the very last twist, i recalled arnold schwarzenegger's "total recall". this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once, and i really did not like the last scene, when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea. in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic "cube", and this second work i see is also stunning. my vote is eight.title (brazil): not available

this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci-fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali. the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen. the film is superbly shot, i love the cinematography in this, it feels fresh and original. plot-wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall, dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci-fi stuff. morgan sullivan (jeremy northam) is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp, a large technological corporation. he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do. it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen. it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife. after his first job things become strange, his habits change, his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares. he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster (played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu.) he takes an instant attraction to. however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems. he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp. the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies. sullivan, whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain-dead day dream while the speakers drone on (the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages.) suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else. digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence. sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby. digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it, they now effectively control what these spies do, except for sullivan. when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp, make sullivan a double agent. they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down. samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system. the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn. he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him. when a mysterious third party becomes involved, the person it is revealed that foster works for, sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent, who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for. the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires. the cast are great. northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent. he brings a great visual aspect to his performance, his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby. lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact. the rest of the cast are also good.director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci-fi flick cube, has a real visual flair. he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look. for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively. the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci-fi films, it is up there with them. the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this, that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident. the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along. this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states. ****1/2

this filmfour funded sci-fi movie is most definitely a must see. while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise; it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive, despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film. it's good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they aren't getting wide releases), and cypher is refreshing for that reason. the plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher's mystery. the plot follows morgan sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. however, his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita...this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future. this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type, with it's only real close affiliate being kubrick's a clockwork orange. the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing. you never quite know where you are with the plot, which serves in making it all the more intriguing. the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars; jeremy northam and lucy lui. northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale, and does well with his role. lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent, but she has a look about her that just fits this movie.cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an inventive recent sci-fi film; cypher is the way to go.

jeremy northam's characterization of the stuttering, mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch. his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face, neck and lips. no matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. love also cannot be "brainwashed in" with either of his two fake wives. in gradual stages, he begins to dispense with his glasses, to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses. the music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriately driving at times. the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi "film noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu's portrayal, whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states, the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith, some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part. she is just no match for northam's talents, but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author.

you'll notice by the stars i've given this great film that '...before you see it the first time,' is implied. i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much great coming in). i'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too. still, it did.this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. the entire film is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns. i would have given this film 10/10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. i don't hold that against this film too much, but i don't think it deserves a perfect score.lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). i think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed, as well.jeremy northam does really well, at first, as quite a geeky corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. however, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. i know some fans of clive owen, jude law, or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this, but northam would/could/should fit that bill. he's suave and cultured. he's got a great bond posture and voice. i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it, and rather down-to-earth, as well.great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films.

there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers. this film also included one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes in recent years. the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller.although the plotting of the film was convoluted, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed.in 1949, george orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state, which would control minds and diminish human liberty. it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the state, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.

when the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration. that didn't really happen, surprisingly, and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear. but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.the story is of a morgan sullivan, who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called digicorp. his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company, while under an assumed and false identity. his home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing. however, things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what's going on, he starts to question who he actually is. this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up...twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated, and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable.it's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future, and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat.highly recommended.

when i was six yo, i learned about a series called "los campeones", and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch "the champions" and "the avengers" once every week. i think that was the golden age of english series... (i already own the complete cycle of "the prisoner"!) but lasted also a few years later with "the tomorrow people", "the worst witch" (i just me, or this is "harry potter" in girl, of course, before as much as i want "the campions" to be in zone 1 or zone 4, i'm also waiting for "dr. who" (pack the whole series in a set of, uhm, maybe 300 dvd's, please, i couldn't expend more for it, 8), "people of tomorrow", and several other 'low budget', but great stories to be available within my reached zones. i speak and understand english, but not all my relatives do, including my parents, whom introduced me into these great stories... i hope someday, someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them... dubbed or subtitled, but in the same format i saw them. remember, zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set!

i wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history......i was hooked. the premise was pretty simple; two hardened nemesis agents, richard barrett and craig stirling ( william gaunt and stuart damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) doctor and biologist (sharron macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. whilst making their escape, their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio, thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come...the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived, one season run that has set it up for cult status.monty berman, the producer, was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in episodes such as "happening" ( a studio deputising for the australian outback) and the 'snow' sets of "operation deep freeze" and "the beginning" but if you can get past this, and focus on the characters and the story lines, the show was really a lot of fun. it had a great mix of adventure, and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt).the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig!!). they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. i have to say, i was always a richard barrett fan - i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross, and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv. i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since. however, craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too.the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with, including donald sutherland, jeremy brett, peter wyngarde, burt kwouk, anton rodgers, kate o'mara, jenny linden, paul eddington and colin blakely.notable episodes for me were : "auto kill", "the interrogation", "the fanatics", "the mission" and "the gilded cage" but i am sure every one has their personal favourites.if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time, or to re watch it after many years, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don't think i will ever tire of it.enjoy!

my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970's. we absolutely adored it. there was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual american re-runs (petticoat junction, green acres... you get the idea). it had a similar feel to the avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also british and in the spy/adventure genre).i would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. i've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence. but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.

well, what can i say, other than these people are super in every way. i quite like sharon mcreedy, i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes, i did not realise that they had made so many, i also think that it is a great shame, that they have not made any more. i wish that i got given these powers, imagine me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and being knocked out cold, then waking up in a special hospital. later on, i discover that my body has been enhanced. just like richard barrat. these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you cannot fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry. the music is well written, and to me, puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind, the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats, improved sight, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon. who i thought was beautiful and intelligent. when i was a boy, i had a huge crush on her!!!! now i can see why, on my dvd set. the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series. i also thought that trymane was a good boss, firm but he got things done!

monty berman and dennis spooner followed up 'the baron' with this, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted 'the six million dollar man'. it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster, and i enjoy watching it still. stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett, while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready. the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne. by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson, terry nation and brian clemens, while spooner's own 'the interrogation' compared favourably with 'the prisoner'. i regret that there was never a second series; the concept had so much life left in it. would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron's affections? what if tremayne had learned of the champions' powers? did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw? we never found out, alas.

i was 10 years old when this show was on tv. by far it was my favorite. the actors were very credible. alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous.... i just order the dvd (15 episodes). they didn't have super-powers. they just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight). the 3 actors were very good in their rolls, very believable. there was a good story in each episode. at the time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was suppose to be good, and the characters performs were great. there was no fancy stuff, like in other shows. they didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff.

i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes. but if you liked princess bride and forest gump, you would like this movie. you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose. killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite. just my opinion. i'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french. so this film isn't for a world audience. and while i am not a trained film critic, i know what i like. i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie.

this is not "so bad that it is good," it is purely good! for those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) anyways, killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. it is the single most genius text in cinematic history. i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa. it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. i write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen. it can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now i'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. my comment ended a while ago. hopefully it works when i submit it now.

this is a great example of a good, dumb movie. no, it is not high art by any means. nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks. but so what! the killer tomatoes series (four movies and a cartoon series) are basically good-natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks.as the title suggests, this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france. in this case, professor gangrene (john astin's 3rd time in the role) has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france. steve lundquist returns as igor, a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true king of france. obviously he also plays the aforementioned l-l t k of f, happily skewering the french language.opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato (like the others, ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon) and his human allies. mark price, recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series, plays a thinly disguised version of himself, passing himself as "michael j fox" as a way to win the girl of his dreams. and angela visser is a dream as marie, gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis. oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career! another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell (now best known as the hapless title subject of "who wants to marry a millionaire?"). like co-creator john de bello, rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series.what can you say about jon de bello? not much, really, except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and, having done that, has apparently dropped into obscurity. john, if you ever see this, thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes.the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie. like return of the killer tomatoes, the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew. and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox. this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send-off to the series. okay, the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series (which was also quite clever), but cartoons just aren't the same.

star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways. first, it's a fan made series, available only on the web, and it features mainly friends & neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to, as mickey & judy once put it, put on a show. it's definitely friends & neighbors to, you can tell. a lot of these people aren't the most beautiful looking folks you've ever seen, or the youngest, or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like they're walking on marbles some of them have thick accents, or simply don't seem to speak well in the first place, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they're saying. still, you have to admit, for everything these friends & neighbors have put together, it's actually fun to watch. yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. yes, it's a little odd (though admittedly a little cool too) watching two starfleet males kiss (although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on.) yes, you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st:tos, tng, other shows and the movies, or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show. okay. we can get by that. why? the graphics are first rate. better than almost anything you've seen. and sometimes, a show or two really stands out story-wise some of them are actually real tear-jerkers.hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due. it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude. people, sets, costumes, graphics it's a huge effort on a lot of people's parts. we watch, we return, and we thank them.

hidden frontiers-is more than fan fiction- it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of star trek alive and growing. from a fun little fan project to now a well known net series; hidden frontiers has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it. set in the late star trek: next generation/ds9 and voyager time lines hidden frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other star trek series with set stories using a well developed characters, plots, and story arcs. star trek hidden frontier has taken on social context stories that gene roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space assignments - the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting spatial wars and conflicts sci-fi addicts know and love. done in a "green screen" studio; hidden frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts. the large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. inventive use of green screen technology, props, makes up and costumes work to make the hidden frontier worlds of star trek fun and believable. hidden frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction, and thrived once they got there. hidden frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat. i highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.

this is short and to the point. the story writing used for star trek: hidden frontier is surprisingly good. acting is all over the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills. it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-may 2007.i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics. considering this is all-volunteer, for no profit, it is pretty amazing.if this was being ranked as a professional production, i would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets. however, as a fan-based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts, this is in a league of its own. for sheer volume, i don't think this has been matched. congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire.

with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast. nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work. anyone heard of adobe after effects 7, they should buy it get their keying better.stories are well thought out, plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context. but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode. im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining (dont mind women). anyway... for a fan series this is good stuff. with minor improvement in their green screen, brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning. anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds9.

hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry's mission. their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies. the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved, the stories are more complex, and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive. in season 6 episode 1, countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history. the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting. the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters. there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked!

i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it. i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view. i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out. i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll my compliments to the staff of the star trek hidden frontiers on an excellent job. if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film. the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it

okay, so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way, but from the beginning, hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances, and have always been willing to mistakes they've made. they advice people to see newer episodes first, so they can see just how good the show is, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen. the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show, as the story lines go from strength to strength. the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression, drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way, but that is what star trek is and was all about. it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. yes, they have used some characters from trek history, but they have done them justice - characters like shelby, lefler and necheyev, vastly underused in the show, had a rebirth in the new frontier books, but they lost their sizzle after a while, when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi, and hf shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved. they release bloopers for every episode, so the fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people doing it in their spare time, with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock! what this series, now drawing to a close after 7 years, has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. hf will live for a long time after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.

i kind of consider myself as the #1 fan of hidden frontier, seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - well, not counting conventions, of course. i have been watching hidden frontier since 2001, and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with.hidden frontier is the brainchild of rob caves and his self-made studio, areakt pictures, which operates out of the back room of his house. while not as "fancy" as, say, the tos-based series new voyages (which sometimes gets some of the actors/writers from the original series, like walter koenig, aka mr. chekov), rob and the cast and crew of hf manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called "enterprise". the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star trek's first openly gay character, corey aster (who was introduced in the second season), and his search to find a soul mate. somewhere later in the series, he meets jorian zen, the excelsior's trill helm officer. in the recent story lines with these two characters (warning: major spoiler! do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point!), zen is joined to an exiled symbiont, causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with aster. though the future is uncertain - seeing as the most recent episode, "beachhead", was just shown to hf fans in the chat room last night - i think that this relationship will endure, but only time will tell.gene roddenberry created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles. rob caves created hidden frontier for that same reason - and this is what has made this series as popular as it is. as the previous comment stated, i wish i could give it a rating higher than 10, but it will have to suffice. although next season will be the last - keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek: the next generation - i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode.

this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans, and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and twisting, and it's characters show realistic depth and dimension. the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking. while it's first season might be a little shaky, it's final few are well thought out and well shot. some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise, but these fans don't take no for an answer. i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike, 10/10 hidden frontier crew.make it so...

nicely done, and along with "new voyages" it's a great continuation! fab to see james cawley in the latest episode "vigil" check it out! i like the growing characterisation, and think we have good replacements for the tv actors in a fan-produced piece. this show manages to capture the feel quite well, as they state on the ste, it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience, a strong script editor, and a pick-up in timing and cgi that hf will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is!good work to all concerned!(i have a huge soft spot for lefler & mcfarland (great acting), although i'm a bit tired of "lefler's laws". enough already! shelby's great (if a little uptight) and it's cool she got the ship. commodore ian's nice (like fred flintstone), but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself. the doc, counselor, and rawlins are right on the money in my eyes, as is the wonderful nechayev (what a beautiful accent - a real russian! (well, i'm guessing rene hails from the czech rep.)it gets my vote, and the cgi is kewl. some of the greenscreen's obvious, but on a small budget whaddayagonndo?really glad i found it!(ok, some of the acting isn't great but it's fan-made and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry cmm. cole)the gay material is layed on too thick (graham norton'd be embarrassed). trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging? it's not necessary to showpiece someone's sexuality to this extent - i hope they tone it down & let aster & zen be people not tokens - i don't treat my gay friends any differently, they're just regular guys.musically it's a mixed bag. i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time, but timing can fall flat now & then (the end of "worst fears part 2" misses the crunch, and the edit. love the fact they use the "galaxy quest" music!i certainly can't wait for more!! dazza"never give up, never surender!"viva les frontieres

for the record, i am not affiliated with the production in any way.hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date. over 7 seasons (this is the last) they have produced some 50 or so episodes.this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy.by their own admission, the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects, green screen work and acting all improve.i did find it difficult to "dip into" so started from the beginning and watched all the way through. hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set. characters and "relatives" from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories, sometimes improving on the characters over the original.the whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper reels, a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat.if you are looking for high definition, high budget productions, this is probably not for you.if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think, this is the one.

star trek: hidden frontier is a long-running internet only fan film, done completely for the love of the series, and a must watch for fans of trek. the production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin' it. this doesn't take away from the overall experience however. the cgi ships are fantastic, as well as the space battle scenes... on the negative side, i could tell in the earlier episodes (and even occasionally in the newer ones) that some of the actors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles, but once again, this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek. the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9.

hidden frontier is a fan made show, in the world of star trek. the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta-quadrant . it has some characters from the official star trek shows, but most of them are original to the show. the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships, which gives it opportunities the official shows don't have. the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship doesn't have. the show has good computer animation of spaceships, but the acting takes place in front of at green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors. not all the actors are equally good, but most do fine. the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes. that is a bit more like in babylon 5, than in most official star trek shows. hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using. all in all i enjoyed watching it.

hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based star trek fan series. while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter, or new voyages, hidden frontier concentrates largely on story, and in that regard it does very well indeed.hidden frontier has no physical sets; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen, and the backgrounds inserted digitally. one of hidden frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, instead of in post-production. while this does save a great deal of time, it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, though it still serves its purpose. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, hidden frontier is well worth a shot, though you might be best to start off watching the third season, since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride.

i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film, this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go. all the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate,after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don't watch the movie making- just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child?

the unborn is a very, very different film. james karen & brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well. this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going. though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot. there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me that's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that's it when it comes to that. there is a scene where adams' character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real. the music is very different but very good. the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange! i recommend all horror fans to this movie!

the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia (brooke adames) & bradley marshall (jeff hayenga) who have tried for the last five years to conceive, virginia has had two miscarriages since then & is desperate to have a child. they visit dr. richard meyerling (james karen) for help after he is recommended by some of their friends, dr. meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child. dr. meyerling operates on virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & virginia is pregnant. at first everything seems perfect & the marshall's couldn't be happier, but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as virginia's pregnancy develops problems, she becomes moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worrying phone call from beth (jane cameron), another woman who has undergone dr. meyerling's procedure, who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends & is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher. virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her...produced & directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror/thriller (it's definitely not a sci-fi film as the imdb would have you believe) that pleasantly surprised me. the script by henry dominic tries to be different & it must take some credit for that at least. the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares & bad special effects, it's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears. it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means. the climax was good & seemed a fitting way to round things off & the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then, maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn't. on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements & is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times. also, i have to mention it, what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh?!director flender does an ok job, the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough. the atmosphere is good & there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her & dr. meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment. disappointingly the blood & gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens, the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it.technically the film is ok, i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland & forgettable. the baby creature is actually a decent special effect & has fairly realistic facial movement. the acting is good & this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends (1994 - 2004) star lisa kudrow, i have to be honest i don't like friends & i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did.the unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen, it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves. if your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different, something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn. followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii (1994) which i watched straight after this, check my review out if you want..

the unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy. it's very well acted by the always-good brooke adams and b-movie stalwart james karen, although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b-grader. the music, by gary numan of all people, is good too. henry dominic's script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. rodman fender's direction is merely adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap scares. if you're a fan of adams, whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be, check it out; she's great, as always.

the unborn is a roger corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless. if you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it's chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions. brooke adams stars as virginia. her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can't have kids on their own. there they meet dr. meyerling (james karen of rotld 1 & 2). dr. meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant. (insert joke here.) is it because he's creating some genetic killer supermutant babies? that's what virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment. that's when she starts taking matters into her own hands.on this one, you'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if i told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your netflix rental queue too quickly. it's a bit slow-moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third, all systems are go! very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un-pc fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.

life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. the acting is rather amateurish, at best. the special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. the story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable. for me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell. she may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. in all life pod is much like other low-budget sci-fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable.the white star lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic (not the sister of titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.

i agree with "jerry." it's a very underrated space movie (of course, how many good low-budget ones aren't underrated?) if i remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation (but not "rip-off") of 2001, because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man, who had somehow been turned into a computer. and like hal, they tried to disconnect his "mind", but not the mechanical parts of him, and as with hal, it led to disaster. there is at least one funny moment. when the christopher cary character, who can't find any food, finds the abandoned pet bird, there's a kind of ominous moment, but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all.

wow. something of a surprise. though flawed, it is far better that i expected.the brand new space liner arcturus with some 3,000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter. without warning, the ship's cerebral (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. soon, there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship's astrogators (penny), the captain (cary), and the director of the shipping line (kenyon).it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is actingerratically. the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship andavoid personal conflicts in order to survive.the film starts out very well. the opening commercial is a very nice touch. there are obvious parallels to 2001: a space odyssey and to the historicsinking of the titanic. the film does slow down at times and has pacingproblems, but is generally well made and well acted.

i enjoyed albert pyun's "nemesis" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. a lot of people complain about the "confusing" plot to the first film, which is probably why "nemesis 2: nebula" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.this one gives the name of the first movie's hero, alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. she is raised by a tribe in africa. a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles, which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). it doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). there are subplots involving africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. the picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. it has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie.

this is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! i think that sue price did a great job in this film series (nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula (nemesis 2). though not a film of great value and sue price's acting skills not the best to have met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action! well, some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as terminator or predator, but that's not the point. the point is that a.puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). what a pity it hasn't shown yet on dvd :-(

i must admit i'm a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke. i think its a great horror/sci fi film. colonel steve west (alex rebar) returns to earth after an historical space flight to saturn. while in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease. he wakes up in a hospital bed, he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting! escaping the hospitals supervision, he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town. unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people. he must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive! stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! its up to his old friend dr ted nelson (burr debenning) to find him and try and help him. he has to work alone as his boss general perry (myron healey) wants it kept ultra quiet. nelson can't even tell his wife judy (ann sweeny). however, sheriff blake (micheal alldredge) becomes suspicious as general perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten. i don't really understand why this film gets such negative reviews, what do people expect? anyway, i really like this film. the star of the film are unquestionably rick bakers special make-up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent, and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible cgi makes them even better. writer and director william sachs isn't afraid to use them either, we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well, even now. photography, music and direction are a little bit dull, but professional enough. the script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster, shots of him looking longingly into ted nelsons house, or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently. the ending, set in a large factory of some sort, is pretty downbeat so don't expect any happy ending. which surprised me. also, the script doesn't really do anything with the premise, he just walks around melting and killing, with his friend trying to stop him, maybe a bit too simple. personally i think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion, her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too, it looks and sounds totally ridiculous! you need to see it to believe it! i like this film a lot and recommend it to 70's and 80's horror/sci fi fans. a bit of a favourite of mine.

to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. as a kid in the 50s thats all there was. in 1957 i saw "the first man into space" in a movie theater with my dad. it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. scared the good & plenty right out of me. the memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me. the incredible melting man is almost a re-make only in full glorious color...that is wherever the scenes were well-lit. just gotta love it for what it is......a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises, and that eerie music. bravo !

the melting man...a tragic victim of the space race, he perished melting...never comprehending the race had long gone by...!a man (burr debenning) burns his hand on the kitchen stove. but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream, he shouts something that sounds like "aaaaatch-kah!!" this movie you've popped in...isn't a normal movie. you've just taken your first step into the incredible melting man, the famous late-70's gore film featuring rick baker's wonderful makeup effects. baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar, and did this at the same time as his famous "cantina aliens" in star wars. for some strange reason, star wars became a household name, and incredible melting man did not. it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind-numbingly awful. from the opening credits ("starring alex rebar as the incredible melting man"...that's really what it says!), to the chubby nurse running through a glass door, to the fisherman's head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks, this film provides many, many moments of sheer incomprehensibility. "why did they...but how come he...why are they...?" after a while, you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is--a very entertaining piece of garbage.an astronaut returns to earth in a melting, radioactive condition; he escapes and, his mind disintegrating as well as his body, begins a mad melting killing spree. the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped, but (probably not wanting to "cause a panic") want him captured as quietly as possible. so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him. wow.storywise, surprisingly little happens during the movie. the melting guy wanders around killing people. a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter. various characters are introduced, ask questions, and leave. eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man, but is shot by a security guard for no reason, after he explains that he's "dr. ted nelson." the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo. the end.it's so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun, despite a fairly downbeat ending. supposedly, a widescreen dvd release is planned. a very special movie.

thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo, can't stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena, and even that granola over there doesn't look so innocent anymore! why wasn't the song "slop time", by the sherrys, used as the theme?

as a collector of movie memorabilia, i had to buy the movie poster for this film which, now that i've finally seen it, has to be the best thing about it. there's nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man. however, there's nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man. at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh. the character of dr. ted nelson has to be the most wishy-washy persona ever brought to the big screen. his dialogue is so trite it's unbelievable! ("it's incredible! he seems to be getting stronger as he melts!)and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to "help" him? if this movie was meant to scare its audience, i think it missed its calling.

astronaut steve west (alex rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of saturn. his comrades are killed instantly, but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones. steve returns to earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer, melting every step of the way, he is tracked by his friend, dr. ted nelson (burr debenning).this is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional. it seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's, and as such, it's a marvelously entertaining movie. that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. we're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything, but is still a gas to watch.writer / director william sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed. i think his pacing is a little off; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go on a little long, but ultimately he delivers solid, schlocky, b-movie goods with a degree of panache. the climax is especially fun.arlon obers' music is enjoyably shuddery (yet also amusingly silly during some moments), and willy curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times. that brings me to rick bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects, which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie, right down to the ultimate final melt.rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and does what he has to do well enough. debenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero, and ann sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife, but myron healey, michael alldredge, and lisle wilson are fine in support. it's also worth it to see folk like cheryl "rainbeaux" smith (doing an appreciable topless shot), janus blythe (of tobe hoopers' "eaten alive" and wes cravens' "the hills have eyes"), and even director jonathan demme in a bit part.this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore, chills, and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere.8/10

first off, anyone looking for meaningful "outcome oriented" cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated, emotive, heartfelt thespians, please leave now. you are wasting your time and life is short, go see the new brangelina jolie movie, have a good cry, go out & buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better, and leave us alone.don't let the door hit you on the way out either. the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young, tv friendly cast & crew, and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects, wakes up in a hospital, and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump. the melting man is played by one alex rebar, who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film. but once he starts oozin' with rick baker's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny, viscous blebs of grease.the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points: there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care, really. it's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it -- one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out. hilarious.the "hero" of the film is played by burr debenning, a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s & 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype; slightly twisted, neurotic, and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused. he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead (or the alien zone) that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma, which is where i suspect this film was made as well. the arid, cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same, and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning ... which also had a sick sense of humor, a tv friendly cast, and some pretty outrageous gore. i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies, as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man's cast.essentially, as others have pointed out, this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects & the inevitable boobs. the movie it probably borrows most of it's ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree. one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man's motivations: he simply goes on a rampage and the movie's drama comes from wondering if he's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness. the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen, rick baker's disgusting effects getting the lion's share of whatever was spent on this.sick, disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer. why can't people have made more movies like these? 8/10

"the incredible melting man" is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! the ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of hammer's "the quatermass xperiment" ...only a thousand times filthier! astronaust steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! in shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. doctor ted nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of rick baker. the melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader! another big advantage is that william sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. the repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you'll miss out on all the campy fun!

it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series, from one to seven. and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain. plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn't see and i what to see it so badly like part two. it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans, which is cool, and showed the return of the puppet master from part one. it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool, it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did.so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit.

this movie is a great way for the series to finally end. peter (the boy from puppet master iii) is all grown up and is now the puppet master. well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets. most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii, puppet master iii, puppet master 4, puppet master 5, curse of the puppet master, and retro puppet master (sorry... but i guess paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1). personally i wish puppet master vs. demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say "this is the final movie in the series..."

"the day time ended" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it's better than "close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story doesn't make sense. but that only makes it all the more intriguing. like many of the best works of art, "the day time ended" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the "existential" european films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)

the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. director john "bud" cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger, crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds. moreover, cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder. the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus: jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams, dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana, christopher mitchum as the concerned richard, marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth, natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny, and scott c. kolden as the gutsy steve. the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures, neat stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and nifty matte paintings. richard band's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot. john arthur morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick. a fun flick.

if you love cult 70's sci-fi the way i do, or if you like movies such as "repo man" or "buckaroo bonzai" than you're going to love this one. it's a stream of consciousness 70's sci-fi spectacular, including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now. this movie is pure 70's. put on steve miller's "fly like an eagle" or pink floyd's "dark side of the moon" and you're ready to go!

considering it was made on a low budget, the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work.the story involves a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they think. but their youngest daughter (natasha ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. and only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. thus the family, led by jim davis and dorothy malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.mixing in elements of 2001: a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind, the day time ended, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen. the desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters; and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubrick's or spielberg's films, the day time ended is much better than many other 2001/close encounters knock-offs. i give credit to director john 'bud' cardos, whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia, for at least trying--and on that basis, i give the day time ended a 7 out of 10.

bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the williams family, living in the california desert. they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other, a friendly and tiny little e.t. who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. this picture does show off a little imagination, if nothing else.very nice music by richard band, engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen, randall william cook, and peter kuran, and, importantly, a likable family are key assets. it generates a sense of child-like amazement; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.i found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion, and a decent credit for director john "bud" cardos (of "kingdom of the spiders" fame) and executive producer charles band.7/10

probably the most whimsical installment of the first season, 'shore leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short, but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode. kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on. it appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. the first indication that things might go just a little awry is when mccoy, leading an advance team, spots alice (from wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters. the one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person/place/thing they discovered right before they discovered it. this doesn't immediately sink in with kirk or anyone else. more strangeness ensues, including sightings of don juan, a siberian tiger, a ww2 fighter plane, etc; kirk meets up with ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his academy days, finnegan. the chase/fight scene with finnegan goes on too long but at the same time, mccoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. finally, an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening. the planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear. nothing is permanent; mccoy isn't really dead. once this is explained, kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all. despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending, 'shore leave' holds up as another first-rate episode of star trek's first season.

i watched shore leave the other day. i've seen it so many times, and i never get tired of it. strangely enough, every time i watch it lately, it takes me right back to the very first time i saw it. including this time. must be that sense of mystery and "what is going on here?" about it.oddly enough, the one part of the story that always felt awkward and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a huge effect on me-- ruth. i think a lot of it was gerald fried's score. a real masterpiece, that! the romantic section was reused-- much more extensively-- in this side of paradise. but of course, it debuted here. i get the impression that, out of all the girls kirk knew over the years, she may have been the "sweetest". when she said, "do you have to go?", combined with the music, i could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.someone commented online that ruth looked older than he was, yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years. which makes me think... maybe she was one of the teachers at the academy. kirk had an affair with an older woman! (perhaps he thought back to this in "miri" when he told janice, "i never get involved with older women." maybe he meant, "...anymore."reading st reviews the other day, i see where someone compared what are little girls made of? with i, mudd. but it seems shore leave oughta be in there, too. what are all those "people" if not androids? and could "the caretaker" be related to "the old ones" from the earlier episode? whoever he is, he seems to be one of the rare cases in st where you have a race that is actually "superior" as opposed to merely thinking they are.yeoman barrows seems to be filling in for yeoman rand. considering how much attention dr. mccoy showered on her, it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again! sheesh.one thing missing from the last several i've watched that snuck back in here was, spock smiling. he was! i saw him. i really prefer knowing there's 2 sides to him going on inside all the time, rather than this "submerged" business. when he said, "enjoy yourself, sir." near the beginning, you could see it wasn't just his addressing his superior officer, but talking to his friend. and at the end, when he needlessly says, "totally illogical!", i can't help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction. he may not be smiling or laughing, but i think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy.

this one's a romp; many trek fans don't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones, but this one is so well executed for what it is, so successful as pure entertainment, it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes, no matter what mood i'm in. several well known future movies ("westworld") and tv shows (the more bland "fantasy island") took their cue from the premise of this episode (then, of course, the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology). beautifully filmed (especially evident in the restored version and on dvd) and directed, it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to. it's odd that no animal life, even insects, seems to exist here (how are flowers pollinated, for example), but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past (kirk has a people-heavy past, it turns out), as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories. sulu even finds an old-style police revolver (adding to his collection of swords, no doubt).by this point in the trek series (halfway thru the first season), the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we'd come to know over the many proceeding years. here, we get to really see them relax, converse and work together to figure out this episode's puzzle: the strong narrative is a mystery again, of sorts, and the audience is along for the ride as kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them. it's almost whimsical, following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue (the enterprise had, it's suggested, just completed a harrowing mission). then dr. mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback; yes, this is dr. mccoy's final episode...just kidding. but, it's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story. mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and, like the best trek episodes, the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic, more desperate tempo of action and suspense. this is all signaled by kirk's resolute response to sulu, who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoy's death - kirk will get to the bottom of all this, come what may.but, it doesn't get much easier for kirk: what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days, a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet. yet, this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness, with another of kirk's past acquaintances. this episode runs the gamut of all human experience, rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet. it's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what's happened, as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines (unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there). and there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to 'work' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion, or we just don't function in a 'normal' natural way. also, note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand, who did not return until the first trek movie in '79. i believe that after this episode, even more trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters. but i leave this episode with a final, perhaps tantalizing thought: if mccoy was killed (verified by spock), how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship? perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data.

probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb balance of terror) with a lighter affair, shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi, and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry (the true triumph is trouble with tribbles, in season 2), the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness.diverting from the show's tradition, the enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode. instead, kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty: a well deserved break after three months of incessant work. the earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: dr. mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carroll's work. soon, other people begin experiencing similar things: a woman meets a don juan-like character, sulu has a run-in with a samurai, and kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy. throw in a freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt.the idea is a classic one: idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly. the episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful, weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious william shatner). and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of star trek's success.7,5/10

"shore leave" is mostly an average star trek adventure. nothing wrong with the episode, though. i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans. it is lightweight entertaining, nothing more. however, i'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. in this episode, kirk decides to grant his crew some time off, and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. as usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be. there are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played for laughs. good, but unexceptional.

another episode from childhood that, as an adult, i look back on with a different perspective. this was one of my favorite childhood episodes, one that really cemented my adoration of this show. however, on viewing this episode after 20 years, i'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones, played for laughs and amusement, instead of the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this, their first and best season. perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r&r too! as mr. spock would say, the story just isn't logical but there are some amusing lines like, of course, mr. spock's final one at the end--when he asks the captain, mccoy et al whether they enjoyed their r&r and they answer in the affirmative, he raises an eyebrow and says "fascinating..." in only the way mr. spock could do that. an interesting story line, of course, the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying "amusement" of disneyland, for example), being able to have one's wishes actually come true. really, a great idea but not that well executed. and coming from theodore sturgeon, another of the great sf short story writers they used in the first season, one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that sturgeon turned in.now, here is a little trivia i learned on this very site: in 1987, james gunn established the theodore sturgeon award for best short science fiction story. and i'll quote the rest from this site: in 1968 he {sturgeon} wrote "the joy machine", a third script for the star trek tv series {amok time the other}, that was never shot. the main reason that it wasn't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget. however, the script was adapted into a book by sci-fi writer james gunn (star trek #80, the original series) and published by pocket books in 1996.i'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable, especially if one doesn't think too much about it. just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe.

this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun. but, i appreciated this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. think about it--the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland, a bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills mccoy, and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end. despite all the danger, you just can't take everything very seriously--it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. so, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.

bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this. shore leave is really tos' first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles). it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of, for example, the corbomite manouever.looking for a place to chill out for a while, the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet, and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look. soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly perilous - but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery (mccoy has gone through the looking glass), psychological thriller (kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past), and romantic comedy (no comment).tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise, so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy-handed, potentially calamitous drama. unlike later series franchise writers, tos' production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before. and shore leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. my only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st's themes. the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run - both compositionally and in terms of acting.'nuff said. my recommendation - see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen - it order.

okay, we've got extreme verhoeven violence (although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks), we've got plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missing...oh, yes, it's missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci-fi movies. i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most verhoeven films, the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre. the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible. the crew has truly made an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects done on set). the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible, they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible.the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive. here, it takes place at a lab for the most part. i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or let's say steal something from people's purses, or something like that. but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie. grade: b

contains spoilers"hollow man" is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven, director of great movies like "total recall", "starship troopers" and "robocop" has ever made. that's probably not his fault. for some reason, verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script, and he made the best of it. the first part of this movie is rather good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even skunk anansie on the soundtrack. unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad "alien" clone. the ending is especially ridiculous <spoiler>, as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. </spoiler>. and the entire thing is quite shallow, indeed: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated.but all in all, verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie. **1/2 out of **** stars

paul verhoeven (genius and master film maker) strikes back with the less than perfect, yet still fun in a "dirty old man type of way," hollow man. the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints. yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it's mind blowing special effects (perhaps the best so far around) and two dandy performances by the leads. verhoeven's moral questions are of course thought provoking, and although the film turned off many, this movie is pretty soft-core for old verhoeven.two major flaws: josh brolin (aka walking ape-man) and the whole deal with the elevator. if there was an access ladder, why were they trapped down in the lab? a fun horror film for a saturday night.

hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade. the sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film. kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way.claude rains shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933, well now, kevin bacon has shocked *us* with hollow man. one of the most thrilling horror films ever. the action is intense and the chills are true. you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night. the supporting cast includes elizabeth shue, josh brolin, kim dickens, joey slotnick, greg grunberg, and mary randle. all of whom do an exceptional job. ---spoilers---dr. sebastian caine (kevin bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. after animal testings, they move on to human testing. but someone has to be the subject. volenteering, caine is turned invisible. but when his team is unable to bring back into visibility, caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge...*end spoilers*the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century. becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie 2, this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go. the first 45 minutes or so are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. think of deep blue sea. then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man. and then change the water into fire and explosions. a rehashing of a killer shark movie. interesting... hollow man gets 5/5.

this movie scared me so bad, i am easily scared though so its no big thing but this movie was scary and whoever wasnt scared by this movie, im surprised because everyone i know said it was scary, i hope everyone sees it, but dont see it with the lights off like i did....

remember h.g. wells' "the invisible man"? well here's another movie like it, only more extreme. "hollow man" is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. kevin bacon plays sebastian caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes. at first making the serum was the easy part, making the person come back was not. most of the first tries ended up unstable. until one night, when he perfected the formula. and who else, but caine would be the lab rat. the gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came to, it was a close one. so when the did caine, he decided to use it for fun. then when he got tired of being not seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh. however, the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should, and caine would delve into madness. so he ends up being one mad invisible killer. it would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you. i would care less about the ones who did you wrong. great movie, plenty of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!

hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr. sebastian caine (kevin bacon) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum. they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly, caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human. he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. but then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants...directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man. you know it's just after christmas, i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief. the script by andrew w. marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man (1933) film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit. it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. i thought the character's were ok, i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself. then of course there's the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.director verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that. there's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla. there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.with a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 hollow man is technically faultless, i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they? the acting was ok, bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well i know i do. good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.

a pentagon science team seem to have perfected a serum which causes invisibility but when the lead boffin tries it out on himself he can't reverse the process. frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychotic in the classic h.g. wells tradition.this is a gleefully horrible invisible man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful verhoeven and bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac. as with much of verhoeven's work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of boy's-own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals (women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels). whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea, the cg special effects by scott e. anderson are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere. in particular, a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where bacon drowns devane in a swimming pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects. the film also has a great soundtrack by jerry goldsmith and classic horror-movie photography by jost vacano. the young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree, but both shue and dickens are impressively out of their depth. this is a great fun nasty movie.

it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased, in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version. true, "hollow man" is a remake of sorts of "the invisible man", but that's where the similarities end. "hollow man" is an entertaining movie,period. if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible, then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place. true, some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable, but "hollow man" manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends. kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible. now his mission is to make them visible again. when this team of young scientists (working, as you might guess, for the pentagon)think they have the formula for making animals visible again, kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug. after that, of course, things go wrong, as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask, so his collaborators know where he is. feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin's character, and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator (elisabeth shue) is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team, he finally snaps. the movie then turns into a hybrid of "alien" and a slasher flick, but that's not saying it's a bad turn. there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace. the special effects are top notch (a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven's films)as we get to see some "body reconstitution" sequences never seen on a movie before. if there's anything to complain about, perhaps, is the predictability of the situations herein; by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end. and the ending is a bit abrupt, but despite this, hollow man is still worth watching. if you want to know what a truly bad movie is, then waste your money on "fear dot com" (with stephen dorf) or the even worse the untold (or "sasquatsh", with land henriksen). now that is "hollow"! 8* out of 10*!

first saw this movie in about 1990, and absolutely died laughing through it. it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we'd quote from it at the drop of a hat ("i'm going home in a bag!"). needless to say, the humor is still there, 15 years later. it's become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film (good thing you can still buy it off ebay!) i've found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek..and this movie provides it all- pathos, suspense, unrequited love,nobility and the list goes on. royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller. i remember seeing him in "the 7 faces of dr. lao" as a bad guy who met a bad end. here, you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning. if you aren't careful, you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie. the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments, little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies, and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e. coyote!don't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people- this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking, and shouldn't be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they won't know they're being mocked..).-now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna go get a 'zag-nut' bar....-ramsay "rc" cowlishaw, karaoke dj/entertainer

after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax. like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci-fi paraday. 'captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick. he was a brave man.' the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket. and always remember to beware of the 'doughnut of death!' keep in mind the number one rule of this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and 'prepare to die earth scum!' you just have to see it for yourself.

there are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off. the lead martian's jack nicholson take-off is side-splitting. the plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed. this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all. make some popcorn and have a great evening.

this movie is just plain silly. almost every scene has some bit of humor: running gags, slapstick, and great jokes. the acting isn't that great, and the plot is cliche, but the jokes more than make up for that. if you have a chance to see this movie, i recommend that you do.

this movie is to halloween what the hilarious "christmas story" is to christmas: both are relatively low-budget, no-big-name-stars type films...and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available, both seasonal classics!!! "spaced invaders" comes galloping out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters...all five goofy martians, klembecker the realtor, russell the deputy, vern at the "fuel dispensing depot" and so many more! you just have to see this movie to believe it, and, like "christmas story", it just keeps getting better and better with each viewing, and you pick up on fun little things each time!! most definitely a ten!!!

i found the memorable quotes searching for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites...old person 1: you know, i remember the first time they played that thing. old person 2: you remember pterodactyls. old person 1: and i can remember you fell for that, hook line and sinker. old person 2: oh, i did not. old lady: you did so. you put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight martians. old person 2: ain't you dead yet?

this movie is funny and suitable for any age. it is definitely family-type entertainment. the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid-western town of big bean, illinois. where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the interstate. the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians. but these martians are totally inept, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons... including one set on eradicating the martians, too! the martians dead-pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them... leave earth. j. j. anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines. watch this movie for laugher and entertainment; thought-provoking it isn't. but subtle and enjoyable it is.

like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. for example of the adult level humor, the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. the martian pilot, blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson; the scientist, that of peter seller's dr. strangelove. the special effects are surprisingly good for this film. the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is wayne alexander's "vern" character). i had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie.

anyone who does not find this movie funny, does not understand simple comedy. this movie is not a complex comedy, it is full of one liners, and sight gags, and will make anyone who wants to laugh, laugh... the alien who is doing a nicholson impression will crack you up!

if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot, it would have been just one more waste of time, money, and creative effort. fortunately, by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds, they have created a comedic marvel. who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson, complete with the lakers t-shirt. do not dismiss this film as trash.

normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles. but here is a sci-fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast.... and it is gold! the very concept of a small bunch of diminutive,aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent. don't be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids' movie it is unsophisticated - it isn't, there's a lot of hidden treasure... a gem!

this is cult stuff. my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie. its very funny and very dry . i've seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy it.the actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing! if you enjoyed "morons from out of space" you will love this. a great play on war of the worlds. i love the red-neck rampage to get the aliens, the bug on the hood, the dod, the heat seeking populous annihilator, the mine field, the red camo, breaking the speed limit by 1800mph! "i'll get the bucket!" very funny. i would love for this to come out on dvd! forget the negative reviews see it for yourself!

basically, this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do, rather than having to sit through it for two hours. or, as in my case, you see it as a kult hit, one of those movies wherein the humour, the plot, the acting, is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it, trusting the director well, the reward is: u laugh your a.. of !! the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above, actually makes the movie even more funny, because u get the impression the director isn't even aware of how funny his movie is, which doesn't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : spaced invaders !!

laughs, adventure, a good time, a killer soundtrack, oscar-worthy acting, and special effects/ animitronics like none other, what else could you want in a movie? if you see this will be on the telly, watch it, otherwise, run out now to rent it!!!

this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises, but who love the history and traditions of sci-fi and classic hollywood movies. each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci-fi character or member of hollywood royalty and it's pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean.

i loved this movie. you have to respect midgets that dressed up like tiny martians. sure the story may have been thin at times, but you can't take away from the way it was done. i used to watch this over and over again when i was 8. its a kids movie, and besides, it has some of the greatest quotes ever. blanzee's "home on the range" rendition is awesome. very well done if you ask me, 8 of 10.

this is a thinking man's silly movie. if you don't expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i - from casting the "voice" of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way.it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie.

if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating. but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone,just people with a sense of humor.for those people the movie is great! it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone, most of witch where b-rated themselves. along the lines of spaceballs and airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes, but it is well worth it.

being from a small town in illinois myself, i can instantly relate to this movie. considering the era it was made in, the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people i grew up with. yes the plot is so-so. and yes, the acting is not going to get nominated for an oscar anytime soon. but that isn't the point. the point is to suspend reality and just have fun. and this movie has fun aplenty. from the greedy,uncaring banker to the well meaning,but dimwitted deputy, this movie was made to poke fun at the scifi genre and small town living at it's best. who can't smile at the sight of the enforcer drone or the vern droid? and i loved the farmzoid. wish i had one when i was growing up. overall, considering the technology they had available at the time, this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood, when you could sit back on a saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand, and laugh at the foibles of small town living. this is a movie i would watch again and again, if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways.

"i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing!" the small town sheriff laments."this happens a lot in chicago?" his deputy asks.well, no, not really. the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles' war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion, and conclude they need to get in on the action! what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martian's haphazard attempts to conquer the town of "big bean, il". everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes, except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend, a kid in a duck suit.the martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on. it's a fun family movie.

"spaced invaders" is one of the funniest movies, i´ve ever seen. i don´t understand, why this movie didn´t get better critics, it´s funny, harmless and sweet. i first watched it, when i was 11, and i really fell in love with it... 2 days later, i got it on vhs :-p till today, i´ve shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. i think, that´s the problem, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... this movie never got a real chance, that´s sad, "si" has really the potential of a comedy like "monsters inc." or "spaceballs". ok, enough displeasure - what i really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it! even if you don´t get mad about it, it´s worth watching! --> prepare to laugh, earth scum!

i don't know how anyone could hate this movie. it is so funny. it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline. it's not your typical alien movie. these aliens are so stupid and confused. you need to rent it at least once.

this movie is not for everyone. you're either bright enough to get "it" or you're not. fans of sci-fi films who don't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie. i recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies. everyone i've recommended this film to has enjoyed it. if you enjoy monty python or mel brooks films, you'll probably enjoy this one. the voice characterizations are done in a tongue-in-cheek manner and the one-liners fly fast and furious.

looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun....i was lucky enough to see the film during its all-too-brief theatrical run. the audience laughed its heads off. i'm watching a tape of it as i type and it's still dang funny!it's also got a sweet side, with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. the late, great royal dano is especially effective as the lonely, down-on-his-luck farmer wrenchmuller. ariana richards and j.j. anderson are great as the lead kids. and the actors in the martian suits, although limited to mime, do a great jobanother thing to look for is the background details. the film is full of homages, pastiches, and references to other sf and fantasy films. take a look at the martian costumes next time. one of them is wearing a marty mcfly costume, another is a ghostbuster, a third is in a house atreides uniform, and a fourth is wearing a last starfighter flightsuit.

after mistaking a halloween re-broadcast of orson welles' classic radio adaptation of war of the worlds for a real martian invasion, a group of moronic martians shows up on earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.this really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. it will most likely appeal to sci-fi fans. this has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than i expected it to be. despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest martian invasion ever put to film. interestingly enough, the martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic action hero/sci-fi hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). fun for the whole family. "prepare to die! earth scum!"

this final voyager episode begins 23 years in the future. voyager has made it back home. in the many years it took to return tho, the vulcan tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. he carried a disease they were too late getting home to cure.captain janeway comes across aliens who have time travel technology. she realizes, there's a warp conduit in the delta quadrant that could bring voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and notify voyager. there's one problem. the conduit is deep inside borg space.janeway visits tuvok. he's like a child. he scribbles tho, obsessed, working on math problems or movie reviews or something, he's convinced are important somehow. in the institution, tuvok cries, asking for 'janeway' to please, please come back to him.janeway decides to commandeer a federation shuttle and equip it with weapons technology 20 years ahead of the borg, in the hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to guide voyager to the warp conduit.when she goes back in time and links up with voyager, janeway meets her younger self. the two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. the real-captain visits tuvok asking him if it's true he has a brain disorder. tuvok admits it's true, but it can't be cured by the facilities on the ship so he's kept it to himself.the young captain agrees to the older captains' plan. to increase their chances of success the older janeway plans to distract the borg with her shuttle craft. the borg actually capture janeway and her shuttle. the borg queen personally assimilates captain janeway. but janeway's expected this! the borg queen has assimilated a virus into herself that kills her. with the borg queen dead voyager makes it thru the warp conduit back to federation space.

i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 2-3 years. thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes. for those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through tng, ds9, voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- "i like the next generation" the best. that's because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation. but to be quiet honest, i appreciate the creativity of voyager's episodes more than tng. voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike tng. granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! endgame portray him as a husband married to an "organic", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before endgame, to disobey captain's order and make "human" mistakes. unlike ds9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, voyager has to survive 3 seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality. of course the rest of the voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, harry kim and tom paris -- very natural. i love tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a vulcan. finally, i'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank god for kate! she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. what a great job! thank you star trek for making voyager, i enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our cosmic expanse.

spoilers. like other posters, i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by "front loading" some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all moot.) i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew. as fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. fortunately, mulgrew(s) pulled it off.

this is a great ending to the show. the fact that adm. janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great. the fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the queen with a "poison" that in, essence, ended the borg was great. the way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. however, they did bring them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic!! it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. ending it with tom and b'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today.

the past few months i have collected voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd (i only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it. am i satisfied with the ending? i think i am. naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. in many ways "endgame" is similar to next gen's "all good things" the involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. a new romance starting in the finale (troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here), which results in death in the future. i truly loved "endgame," fair to all characters, neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. b'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom. tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. the doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe! but of course the captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. the borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager. alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. i feel sorry for susanna thompson though, the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen. maybe she wasn't available though. the special effects are fantastic, the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart! it's very tense. especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection, on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse. voyager could have continued. if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in harry's speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there. and then they could have got home in a film!overall, voyager was a bit hit and miss. the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible! my perception of seven of nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn't true. when she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. and her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. i like her, especially in "someone to watch over me," "imperfection," and "human error." when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. chakotay became my least favourite character. gone was the chemistry with janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time. i loved seeing tom and b'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. i always liked neelix a lot. tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with neelix. harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. the doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates ("tinker, tenor, doctor, spy" is fantastic!). janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it. i wish there was more, i love voyager!

fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults. the first thing about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in southwest idaho. season one's 'deep throat' takes place near ellens air base, also in southwest idaho. i'm wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in fearful symmetry. mulder and scully have some good dialog, always a plus. ed meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, old school teachers. they must have liked children at one time, you just can't imagine how. just like he must have cared more for animals at one point. i liked the concept of the episode, but i felt it had some inconsistencies. if aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely, why can't they put the animal back in the right place? and the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals? i don't buy mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. as if he's an expert on that. i also thought jayne atkinson's performance as willa ambrose was not well done. besides those nitpicks, i still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal dna as well as human dna.

it's easy to forget, once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more, that once upon a time, the x-files' wrote episodes like "genderbender" and "fearful symmetry", where the aliens weren't all little grey men or mind-control goop, but could actually surprise you."fearful symmetry" starts with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time, not a mile away from "the walk" - and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted. and it's very much an episode of wonderful moments. the subplot is annoyingly worthy - yeah, we get it, zoos are bad except when they're not - but the ideas that within it are fascinating, visually powerful, and very memorable, and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked - why *would* humans be the only things that aliens are interested in?in the end, it wasn't an instant classic, but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted, again, very memorable, and mainly, it's something that you couldn't imagine many other shows doing.

whilst it is universally acknowledged that fearful symmetry was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode they have been, they are, they will be, whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point. as a huge fan of both series i subscribe to the latter belief, although the less charitable may not do. james whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it off with style, the teaser being an absolute gem. lance guest does a great job of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack rader seethes with menace as ed meecham. forget fearful symmetry's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file.

viewing "impulse" is a very satisfying experience. unpredictable films are such a rarity, when one comes along like "impulse", it is something to embrace. the script is logical, and extremely creative. meg tilly, tim matheson, hume cronyn, and bill paxton, give believable performances. this could have played out like a zombie movie, but "impulse" is far superior to any boring "zombiefest", and originality shines through in almost every scene. you get the feeling that something like this could have actually happened, even though the script is pure fiction. from the "grabber" opening till the credits roll, you will be fascinated. very entertaining and definitely recommended. - merk

im not a big tim matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film.it was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy,i don't know were to classify this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thriller.i saw this at about 2.00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it.if you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad,the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better.i don,t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to video,i for one would buy this if it,s on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the x-files story attached to it.government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings.overall a good film.

i saw this movie back in 1984, we first started watching "this is spinal tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. so we went instead to see this movie. if you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head, you will want to watch this one. the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are: do you think the government would be capable of doing this? (in my opinion there is no doubt that they could) but i don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself.but, just to let you know, we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do.

i saw this movie on tv late one night years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day.the premise may seem a bit unoriginal - due to an earthquake, a hidden underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is breached, and a microscopic amount of the substance finds its way into their food supply. the inhabitants of the town begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint over every whim and base desire that floats through all of our minds from time to time, and that normally we know we simply must not act upon.the pace of the movie is slow, but for me that only added to the creeping unease as the townspeople's behaviour slowly starts to unravel. there are several surreal and very unsettling scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time.it raises interesting questions about what we could all be capable of if we gave in to our most feral instincts. did i enjoy it? i'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word. did it make me think? definitely. i'm still thinking about it. scary stuff.

ok, first of all, ignore the last person' review. they admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on!!! as thriller/horrors go, this film ain't too bad, it is certainly very watchable. right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the craziness that follows, and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clear.i enjoyed this movie, it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable. great to watch late at night! i give it a generous 7 out of 10.

i think that that creator(s) of this film's concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received. it isn't an oscar caliber film of course, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 (in the theatre). i don't think this is (and hope it isn't) a spoiler, but: imagine acting on your impulses. doing the first thought that pops into your head, saying the first words on your lips... no restraint, no conscious, nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that, as intelligent adults, we know we shouldn't actually say or do. if anything, this film only scratches the surface - it doesn't go as far as it could go. in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older "classics" to try and cash in on today, wouldn't it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success, for the sake of taking it to the next level? a bit further, or even to explore what the original crew didn't, wouldn't or couldn't deal with 20 years ago? that's just my opinion anyway. :o)

i am surprised at imdb's low rating of this movie. with all due respect, its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor. they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more gore.the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film. it is not, nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one. it is a psychological thriller. it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. reel.com's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie. all the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense. it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it.i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense. martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning. the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing.i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone. i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare.kudos to the acting as well. for such a low budget film, you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction, writing, and acting. please don't be fooled by the rating by imdb. this movie is worth it. i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice.

this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold. it's horror-- but not a splatterfest. it's equal part suspense as well as horror-- yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera. the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters.forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe. that's a red herring. he is acting here. 'camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story. adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance-- so she must believe the script has something to say. we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap "cut" and get their paychecks. this is not the case, here.forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-funny regularity. i don't think the intent was humorous-- but to keep you off balance. think of it less of a horror 'movie' and more of a horror 'play' on a stage-- that decrepit whitewashed house. then you might see it's really about paranoia, fear, and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace, usa.and it is twisty. time travel, mind control, secret experiments and nazi's who may not be dead. . .yet.i say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down.

the main problem i see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, "this is a cheap-ass movie." there's not much more to say here. the score just plain sucked.the second problem, which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between martha (adrienne barbeau) and the sunflower man (richard ziman), in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. at all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. in other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau. while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. the main point of her performance that didn't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo-like woman on a mission. this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon barbeau. to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.so what's my holistic grading of this piece? i'd give it a solid c+ to b-, depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism. i see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and nicholas brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance.all in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a nazi you love. :)

i've read some terrible things about this film, so i was prepared for the worst. "confusing. muddled. horribly structured." while there may be merit to some of these accusations, this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer. in fact, it actually had aspirations. it attempted something beyond the typical monster/slasher nonsense. and by god, there are some interesting things going on.ms. barbeau is a miracle to behold. she carries the film squarely on her shoulders.this is not to say that it's a masterpiece. unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition. there are just too many (unexplained) subplots trying to coexist. and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother, then why doesn't she just kill ma in the film's very first sequence? seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do it.still, i give unholy points for trying. a little ambition is not a bad thing.

just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me, was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say, yes the acting is cheesy, some of the effects are laughable.but you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005, and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good. i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last week.i have read the book so many times, and found myself going "ahh yes that's in the book" almost all the time, with the other version hardly anything of the book existed.so well done for at least trying to make a true version.

pendragon pictures' new film "h g wells' war of the worlds", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (march, 2005) but this never happened. the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielberg's version, which hits theatres june 29.i liked this film, with certain reservations.how faithful is the adaptation? it's not quite 100% faithful to wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me. at least several scenes were totally new, such as ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin. but on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george pal.its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. the majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds. this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets. the overviews of 1898 london look like something from a video game. numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- i guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. the only scenes shot for "real" seem to be those in open fields or forests.but within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. artistically, the film looks right. the martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to wells' descriptions. i was particularly impressed with the heat ray. although the thunder child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing. it's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation.the acting and direction won't win any oscars. for the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. the music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composers.i'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen. as it stands, i would rate this similarly to a bbc-tv adaptation of classic literature.a few nitpicks: most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). this may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd. and the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.bottom line -- is it worth seeing? if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, i think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original h g wells novel. if, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a mst3k fan). be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so i don't recommend watching it all in one sitting.btw: an entirely different version of war of the worlds (aka "invasion") came out on dvd the same month that spielberg's hit the theatres: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. this was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film - but it's much better! and to top it off, jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978, but that won't be out until 2007.

the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h. g. wells' great novel, "war of the worlds". this is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them. no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th century, 1900  using wells' original setting, in and near woking, england.imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as "spoilers". that might apply with some films, where the ending might actually be a surprise, but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world, it seems positively silly. i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature, so let's get right to the chase. the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease, against which they have no immunity. if that's a spoiler, so be it; after a book and 3 other films (including the 1953 classic), you ought to know how this ends.this film, which follows wells' plot in the main, is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th century photography. although filmed in a widescreen aspect, the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting. at other times, colors are washed out. these variations are typical of early films, which didn't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality, even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on  as you'll see on occasion here. the special effects are deliberately retrograde, of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s  and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic "feel". some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of big ben. the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd, particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair.this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells' original narrative  as has been noted. viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story. wells' description of the martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed. when the martian machines appear, about an hour into the film, they too give a good impression of how wells described them. both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural england  plus a few scenes in london (involving the narrator's brother). the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (big ben), but at least doesn't dwell unduly on the devastation of london.the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise, despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines. the narrator, traveling about to seek escape, sees much of what wells terms "the rout of mankind". he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality. they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest, where they discover an awful fact: the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene. wells adds that after eating they set up "a prolonged and cheerful hooting". the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder (cheers from the gallery; british curates are so often utterly insufferable).this film lasts almost 3 hours, going through wells' story in welcome detail. it's about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact. a word about the acting: don't expect award-winning performances. they're not bad, however, the actors are earnest and they grow on you. most of them, however, have had very abbreviated film careers, often only in this film. the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana, in his 2nd film. the curate is john kaufman  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing. the brother ("henderson") is played with some conviction by w. bernard bauman in his first film. the artilleryman, the only other sizable part, is played by james lathrop in his first film.this is overall a splendid film, portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it. despite its slight defects, it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors. if you want to see h. g. wells' war of the worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film!

i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i've every seen. it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it. in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better. but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up. and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it.thank you

all of the people reviewing this film, and probably many professional film reviewers, just don't get it. this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker, karel zeman. if you want to know what i'm talking about, i suggest you get any of zeman's films, such as the fabulous world of jules verne, baron munchausen, journey to the beginning of time, or on the comet. if you are unable to locate a film, then read the reviews in amg. they will explain the processes used. if one were to look at zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time, viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either. it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both zemen and hines "do not compute". they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. it isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. i thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. hines took a great gamble, and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing, rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work. regarding the actors, i think hines also took a page from zemen's book, in that many of zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first, but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. i will watch it for years to come, all three great hours of it.

i have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of h.g. wells' classic novel, "war of the worlds". timothy hines has finally done it! i just couldn't believe how good it was! from the acting, to the costuming, the out-of-this world special effects, i just can't say enough!it was wonderful! dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performances by a top-notch cast! it's got to be seen to be believed. i sure didn't. and i've read all those negative comments by the others, and can't believe what they were saying. we must've been watching a different movie, huh? and those real bad comments by that vepsaian guy, guy whoever he is, well, he just doesn't know what he's talking about.keep up the good work, mr. hines.

this movie is a lot better than the asylums version mainly its war of the worlds. the tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better. the action scenes were really cool. walking... walking...walking...walking!!! oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself. the thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed bunch of tripods. good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book. the music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty cool.pros. good soundtrack 99% to the book cool violence tripods and handling machines are cool to look atcons. some bad acting cheesy looking london

the h.g. wells classic has had several incarnations. the 05' speilburg version and the classic 53' version but only this one stays completely true to the book. nothing is changed nothing is removed.originally released as a 3-hour film. the director re-cut the film down to 2-hours of pure excellence. its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that "wells would be proud of" the story is as everyone remembers. martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines. the people of 19th century earth are ill-prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth.the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget. today b-movies have larger budgets.

i didn't mind all the walking. people really did walk places back then. it loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the martians. i too was disappointed by the effects, in particular the "thunderchild" scene, which i regard as one of the most exciting in the book. but i can't praise this film enough, for its faithfulness to wells's story! it's about time. the actors are likable and the performances are charming. also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear jamie hall's truly great musical score. it was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in london.

"the classic war of the worlds" by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h. g. wells' classic book. mr. hines succeeds in doing so. i, and those who watched his film with me, appreciated the fact that it was not the standard, predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. those who envision themselves as amateur "critics" look only to criticize everything they can. others rate a movie on more important bases,like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the "critics". we enjoyed the effort mr. hines put into being faithful to h.g. wells' classic novel, and we found it to be very entertaining. this made it easy to overlook what the "critics" perceive to be its shortcomings.

for a long time, 'the menagerie' was my favorite 'star trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'city on the edge of forever.' what i used to prefer about 'menagerie' was that it's more hard-core star trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current trek storyline. i still think it's fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of spock being court-martialed is a clever one. you can poke holes in the plot if you want. for instance, given the talosians' mind-control abilities and captain pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet? and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st's only two-parter.

imagine that you could have anything you wanted, go anywhere you wished, be anything you'd ever dreamed of being - through thought alone. now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life. what would you do? would such powers be worth your soul? this is the dilemma presented to captain christopher pike in "the cage" the now-legendary pilot episode of the original star trek series. famously deemed "too cerebral" and "too cold" by nbc brass and rejected, "the cage" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and gene roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic star trek episode, which embeds "the cage" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in tv history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen...star date 3012: the uss enterprise diverts to starbase 11 after mr. spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the enterprise. surprisingly, the message cannot be from captain pike after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident. kirk and starbase commanding officer commodore mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery, but before the matter can be cleared up, spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny, kidnapping the helpless captain pike and hijacking the enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few vulcan nerve pinches. soon, the enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of talos iv. mendez informs kirk that talos iv is under interdiction, and any contact with the planet by starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence, meaning that spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself, and kirk as well, given that the captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities. appalled, kirk and mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft, which itself becomes dangerous when the enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone. spock - knowing that kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the captain to certain death. after ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard, spock reveals what he has done to mccoy and demands to be arrested, after having set the starship on an irreversible course to talos iv. upon reassuming command, kirk demands an explanation, whereupon spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - mendez, kirk, and the crippled invalid captain pike. spock's encyclopedic knowledge of starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence. spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the federation and the inhabitants of talos iv - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the enterprise itself under pike's command. kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to talos iv by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously. among the survivors is vina, a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster. pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot, whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the talosians, a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality. after pike's capture, the rest of the "survivors" vanish as none of them really existed except vina. the episode ends when the tribunal learns that spock's "evidence" is in fact being transmitted to the enterprise directly from talos iv, in violation of starfleet regulations. starfleet orders an immediate halt to the transmissions, and we wonder what will happen next...to be continued in a review of "the menagerie: part ii"!

it is a well known fact that when gene roddenberry first pitched star trek to nbc, the original pilot episode, the cage, was rejected for being "too cerebral". when the series was given another chance, roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon, and did so by writing the menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still, at the time, an unaired episode.this time, rather than exploring a new planet, kirk and his crew are on starbase 11, paying a visit to the former commander of the enterprise, christopher pike (sean kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. pike joins his successor on the starship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: spock, who used to serve under pike, has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for talos iv, a planet which is off-limits (the punishment is death) since pike and spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. naturally, being a logical creature, spock turns himself in and arranges a court-martial so that he can justify his actions.there's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will play out in part 2. what really impresses is how roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe, by coming up with a particular type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what could have been of trek, had nbc not turned down the original project. in particular, it's fun to see jeffrey hunter (who was unable to return in the menagerie) play pike as a more serious captain than kirk usually is and nimoy's early days as spock, whose personality hadn't been fully established yet: this is the only time in the entire series that everybody's favorite vulcan spontaneously grins.in short, not just a great "mystery" episode, but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down the cage in its original form (it's available as part of the season 3 box set).

in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes, the tag line was "is it real or is it memorex?" the same might be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of "the cage," the first pilot of star trek. mr. spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet talos iv in order to allow capt. christopher pike, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, to return there. why the finagling? because to have any contact at all with talos iv invites a death sentence. why this is so is never explained - that bothered me tremendously - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. after he has gotten the ship to travel to talos iv, mr. spock turns himself in to dr. mccoy (the senior-most officer present; capt. kirk was off the ship) for arrest and says, "the charge is mutiny, dr.; i never received orders to take over the ship." what follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the talosians - we learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for capt. pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr. spock's death. the illusions the talosians create, the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic. and meg wyllie as the keeper (the head talosian) is wonderful. call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect! the talosians, having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can't really tell if they're male or female and it really doesn't matter. this episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced! what a neat thing if this were so! this is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times i've seen it (i even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly.

the menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot "the cage." the move was made out of necessity, to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced (such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time). one positive outcome back then was that audiences, unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier, were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters, as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history (though they still used terms such as 'united space fleet' in these early episodes).the wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot: the enterprise is diverted to starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans. astonishingly, though even mccoy belabors the fact that spock's vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible, it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain, pike, now horribly crippled. well, spock is half human, we tend to forget. or has he simply gone mad? it may very well be, for he's directing enterprise to talos iv, a planet so off-limits it's the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleet's books. when the jig is up, there's a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy, as uhura looks on in shock. even kirk, usually steady as a captain should be, doesn't know what to make of his first officer's illogical conduct.in the 3rd and final acts, we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from 13 years prior, when capt. pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers. we really don't know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish - and that's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it's all about in the 2nd part. not only is spock facing severe penalties, but it looks like kirk's career may be finished, as well. double jeopardy, folks. this is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts (none were available in the earlier "the enemy within" when the crafts were really needed). there's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then. finally, check out kirk's smug approach at the start of the episode - boy, do things go sideways on him as the story progresses.

indeed: drug use, warehouse shoot-'em-ups, 'matrix'-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of asian races, and a lonely vampire --all in the same movie-- seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a japanese pop/rock star. and that is exactly what 'moon child' is, and more. while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy b-movie of the week, 'moon child' pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the way.the film has a gritty, definitely independent feel to it, jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving glimpses into the characters' lives and barely scraping at a true plot. but the film makes no excuses, instead turning the story into one of friendship, love, trust, and betrayal all sugar-coated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, warring gangsters, and vampires.hyde as the somber vampire 'kei' is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing-out the overly-zealous acting of gackt as 'sho,' an orphan who befriends kei. lee-hom wang also shines as the vengeful 'son' who becomes friends with a grown-up sho. the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives, and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal.while the action at times is all-too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show-off, one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features. the superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. the movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. 'moon child' is rather enjoyable, humorous at times, and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!

i picked this up in the 'danger after dark' box set, and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt. i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america. instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that sho (gackt) develops through the movie as a person. the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards.on a side note, taro yamamoto's performance was very surprising. the only other film i've seen him in is battle royale, where he plays shogo kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo. toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. so, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with battle royale, you'll be very surprised by him.but don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. it's just a movie with a vampire in it. that hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. it's a really moving picture at some points, the photography is really well done. it's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at blockbuster.

this film was amazing. it had an original concept (that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film). it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship, love, immortality, death, and happiness, and comments subtelly on society. on the part of gackt camui, the role of sho was excellently delivered, and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire, kei. i also laughed and cried at the happy-go-lucky character, toshi, who grew up with sho. i loved each and every second of this this film, especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene, the fighting scenes, and most of all, the heartrenching ending.

...would probably be the best word to describe this film (in my opinion). besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls (well, that was redundant~), it was the story that blew me away. hurray for takahisa zeze and gackt! and i know some people will disagree with me on this one, but it wasn't any of the big three actors (the guys that played sho, son, and kei) that gave the best performance (for me, anyway). it was taro yamamoto, boy #5 from battle royale! don't get me wrong, i like hyde, i worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit 'off', but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guy's body killing the other guys. and gackt wasn't at all that bad too, i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start. nothing much i can say about my background on lee-hom wang, i won't pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the star-studded cast. this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations i've ever heard, orenji no taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). while the complete song lasts about nine minutes, you wouldn't notice the length because you'd be enjoying hearing gackt and hyde together. anyway, this movie is a must-see not only for the fans (huge fan base~) but for those who enjoy sci-fi, futuristic movies, asian-style.

i'm a fan of both actors/singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer,i just think this is a silly one.after a long waiting time,i watched it at last and here's my comment...i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first applause goes to acting,generally that japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.yet in moonchild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it,especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for hyde part,his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.i didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel of the film is story.it has some cheesy moments but it's ok for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals.an interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of american cinema,actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew,yet original on it's own.only problem that moonchild is it's a bit slow sometimes,i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it's not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters.but all in all;this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future,and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10

this movie surprised me! not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much! the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style! normally i am very careful when this is claimed! there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action! the fact that "moon child" would feature a vampire convinced me even more! how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires! sounds promising and interesting! the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow! it takes it's time to set the mood! this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes! but "moon child" isn't an action movie! it is a drama about friendship and loyalty! the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other! the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends! the only problem i had was with the plot! a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! example:when one member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment) alexander wang sees kei (hyde) drinking blood of one of the attackers! without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends aren't together anymore! also without a proper reason given son (alexander wang) and sho (gackt) have to kill each other! i know that this is done to add some serious drama! because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced! apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie! it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! but it just is! the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere!

i am extremely picky about the films i see. i'd heard about moon child completely by accident. i've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently.i finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought.being as critical as i am about films, i will admit, the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times...but they're meant too be, as another user suggested, it's the quintessential calm before the storm, quoting gary oldman from leon...without getting into the spoilers, the film hit me extremely hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and like marriage, it's until death do you part.hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics, their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally.upon seeing the film for the first time, i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes. i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film...this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike's "audition" and "suicide club" fame?man..i just can't say enough about this film, but i'll stop here.10/10

when i first saw this movie, the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far. another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie. the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act, very anime. i think that it's a really good movie to watch. ^_^ the action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10). ^_~ if you are gackt and hyde fans, you have to see it.

many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie (gackt, hyde, and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan). but don't judge it before you watch, is what i say. gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. it's a good film with a touchy story inside. several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. they made it so good until i can't stop watching this all over again. the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing. this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language (japan). but, it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie.i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life. when toshi was killed, when sho asked kei to turn yi-che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die, when sho's brother died, kei shoot son die, and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away~ even i told that hyde's skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scene!!there's a time where the plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is sho's brother in law.whatever, i love this movie~ (very much ^^). this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.

moon child was one of the more symbolic movies i've seen. what i really liked about it was the illustration on immorality/mortality,and the obstacles and guidances through life. the movie depicts a great deal of vampire kei having the power of immorality and the advantages to it. whether if it is having supernatural abilities or everlasting life, these are what humans usually wish for. moon child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, since the feelings towards loss impacts almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and kei. the meaning of the title 'moon child' reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other people's way, giving guidance. i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on. the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic. the scene where character toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it. some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game. the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed. nevertheless, i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching. the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers. it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch.

moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise. it's easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters. the fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people, and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else i've ever heard of. it doesn't get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire, it's just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem. the way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic- there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just don't work, which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part.the other area that really stood out to me is the languages. the fictional city of mallepa contains various cultural groups, and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak. japanese gang members speak japanese to each other, but chinese when talking to characters of chinese descent. possibly the most amusing exchange involves an australian and is conducted in english. the actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others' languages, so it's quite a feat that the movie was made at all. which, i suppose, brings me to the lead actors.much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of japan's biggest rockstars, gackt and hyde, as well as taiwanese superstar lee-hom wang, whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them. in my opinion, lee-hom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character. however, any lack of acting ability on gackt's part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over-dramatic. i wasn't sure if hyde's character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across, but it doesn't really detract from the movie either way.there are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns, which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally (although this doesn't seem to stop a lot of people). i found it's best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously- it's perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends. it does have its flaws, but overall it was very enjoyable and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a few subtitles.

this movie is amazing. the plot was just...wow.i was very surprised by gackt's and hyde's performance, after growing up in the american world of the actors who can't sing and singers who can't act.in this movie, a young sho (gackt) comes across a vampire, kei (hyde). over time, they form an unlikely friendship. kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire.it's a sad movie, but not sappy. the plot was very unique, and contrary to your typical vampire flick. the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing.the only fault i would say the movie had, despite it's lack of a happy--albeit peacefulending, would be it's multiple languages. i had the unsubdued version (i'm lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese), so i would recommend getting something with subtitles.all in all, the movie was just awesome.

vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. who could ask for more? moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick! gackt is the innocent sho - who befriends a vampire kei (hyde), their relationship grows with time but as sho ages, kei's immortality breaks his heart. it doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman. the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. it's a touching story ripe with human emotions. you will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry some more. even if you are not a fan of their music, see this film. it works great as a stand alone vampire movie.9 out of 10

moon child is the story of two brothers and a friend trying to make it in a futuristic, economically-unstable japan. after a cunning disaster gone wrong, someone new enters young sho's life, a special friend by the name of kei. years later they have grown rather close, and have found ways to combine both their talents into one unstoppable team. during another escapade, they encounter a new friend and his mute sister who become part of their band of friends. before long disaster again strikes and the group falls apart. alliances turn to enemies and their worlds are all turned upside down. regrets and hopelessness claim some while power and success take others. tragedy claims still others. truths are revealed and lives are forever changed. and you will never see a more beautiful sunrise.this movie is a gripping tale of undying friendships, webs of relationships, and a team that not even death can keep apart for too long. moon child combines sci-fi, drama, and action with the perfect cast and talent to create the most sensationally moving movie of the time, and great for most audiences. it minimizes the everyday romances and puts more emphasis on the important values we can all relate to such as friendships, loyalty, and believing in yourself. nothing could possibly compare. i personally have never seen anything quite like it, and i don't suspect i ever will again.it appeals to the wider population in many ways and is a must see for all.

i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. i just wanted to check it out. i was not expecting much of anything. after all, a musician, an actor and a screenplay writer? not possible for so much talent to reside in one person. right?? wrong!! obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects. the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along. as the credits roll by, you suddenly realize you were glued until the end.at times, the acting seems a little over the top. i do, however, believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character. otherwise, i wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed.it's worth seeing more than once. i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around.i completely recommend this movie. feel free to go in with your doubts, but i'm sure it will find a place on your shelf.

being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde, i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it. i was not disappointed. in fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations. knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors, i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances, but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on. moon child has just the right amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. i can't say that i've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde.

beautifully done. a lot of angst. friendship may not endure all, but in the end it's all that matters, or so a group of friends learn. i have watched it over and over again. the music is also amazing. when kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho, an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature. in the lawless streets of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races, and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay. a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does. i couldn't get enough of it. gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting, proving they are more than pretty boys who sing.

i voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws. other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! it's entertaining to say the least. the shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and i think gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his "matrix obsession" into it. it seems like their enemies just stands there...waiting to get shot at. however, this movie is touching and it always makes me cry. it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well. gackt is a superb actor i must say..he shows so much emotion. this was hyde's first time acting and he did okay. the role fits him. wang lee hom is absolutely great. the whole cast is what i would say, perfect for this movie. don't miss it! you'll regret it!

moon child, starring japanese rockers hyde and gackt, was a better movie then i expected. in fact, i was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies.set in mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, sho, sho's brother shinji, and toshi who rob and murder to make a living. on one of robberies, sho encounters hyde's kei vampire burning in the sunlight. through the coarse of events kei's true nature is shown, yet no one shuns him away.the time passes and implies that the immortal, never-changing kei has raised sho, and the two have a an extremely close bond. sho and kei then encounter son in an outrageous gun fight, and they become quick friends. both kei and hyde fall in love with son's sister, yi-che.time skips ahead again and shows a grown sho, this time void of kei. it also explains that sho and son have become enemies.through tragedy after tragedy this movie dives into the reality of life and all it's hardships, focusing on friendship and love. it is a truly touching movie that is sad yet beautiful at the same time.as for the acting, i think gackt did a magnificent job. hyde did an amazing job for a first timer.the shots were beautiful, but the movie did have it's rare and short gruesome shots.all in all, i must say this movie is amazing, moving, and i highly recommend it.

based on the idea from gackt, moon child took place in a poverty-stricken country called mallepa. in a futuristic timeline, the story followed the lives of the two main characters, kei (hyde) and sho (gackt) and their friends growing up together.despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous, i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship. even amongst all the hardships between each character, in the end, each of them wanted to have someone on their side, to have friends.unlike most vampire characters, kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live. a vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy, sho who's not afraid of kei. regardless of what some might've thought, i see kei as a fatherly figure to sho. kei was there throughout the earlier life of sho, he took care of him, and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives. on the other hand, sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man, he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn't all about fun and games, that death exists and able to take away his loved ones.i love the part where lee hom, the actor who played son, first appeared on the screen. the way they met up was quite cool indeed. son also has a big part within this movie, the fact that he's from a different race, a taiwanese, made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie. the way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie.i believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie. both hyde and gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters. unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs, they've done great acting jobs! moon child really made an impact for me, it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration, that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes. the movie shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad things that happen in their lives, that there's always hope. life can be cruel, that it seems hope doesn't exist anymore. it also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other, even when son became the enemy, sho did have some sort of "fun" at their last battle. every single one of them desired peace in the end, no matter how far apart they've become. the ending scene showed it to us.

i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time, so i was anticipating it greatly when it arrived. my worst fears were that it would be plodding, as well as... well, you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about? gacktnhyde=hawt yaoi love? that sort of thing? dreading it. i was very, very pleasantly surprised. the movie was surprisingly watchable, even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes, and the acting on gackt's part was quite good. hyde, being, um, hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend/gang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by. he's one of my two major beefs with the film itself. but the rest of the cast (including the child actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did- which was, mostly, get shot at and yelled at. but my second problem was very minor, having to do with the goriness. it seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over, really most sincerely dead, or lay there burbling for a rather long time. but sho just... takes the shots, repeatedly, keels over, bubbles a lot while he talks, and makes hyde cry. all in all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-film fan, it's definitely worth a watch.

this is, by all categories, the best movie i have ever seen. forget hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art! moon child's story starts with kei - a japanese vampire, who loathes what he has become and lives in denial. his wish for final death leads him to mallepa, where refugees from several asian countries live. here, he meets sho, an orphan living on the street.from here, the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie. it has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy... never has a movie touched me the way this movie do. and the actors are amazing - never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange. a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece...a last comment on this brilliant movie, is that it stars gackt (ex-vocalist of malice mizer) and hyde (vocalist of l'arc~en~ciel) in excellent roles as sho and kei. i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out.this is a must see. if you never see any films, see moon child, the crow (brandon lee) and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii - advent children. all in their original languages, of course!

this movie is really special. it's a very beautiful movie. which starts with three orphans, sho, his brother shinji and their friend toshi, they're poor children's, living on the street, but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money, and then their able to live on, to buy a house, and their life seems to become much better. they're making new friend, life-friends. but something went wrong and they're becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other.i was negative about this movie in the beginning, because when singers (gackt - solo, ex-singer in malice mizer, hyde - solo, singer in l'arc~en~ciel, both very famous in japan and wang lee-hom - taiwanese singer) trying to become actors, but this isn't like the other singers-going-actors-movies. they're doing a great job, and with no earlier experience in movies (except for lee-hom, who had been in two movies before).this is absolutely one of my favorite movies. maybe that's a little because i'm a very big fan of hyde, but - it was this movie who made me discover him.well, gackt (playing the main character - the orphan sho) was a part of the group who wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that hyde should play sho's friend, the vampire kei. at that time they didn't know each other, at least not like friends. but after the movie they became really good friend, and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation.the movie have many different feelings running trough the story, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. i think the first hour are the best, it's so beautiful. after that people are dying, kei's leaving and it all changes so much. but still it's a great movie, it's the only movie who has ever made me cry, it ends up so sad, but still beautiful.so if you haven't seen this movie, you really should. because it's wonderful, but sad. you won't regret it. ^^

despite what others had said (*cough*), this is my favourite movie of all time. i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it, but once i finally did, i immediately fell in love. sure, it's strange, but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour. for those who don't know, moonchild is one of gackt and hyde's first movies. they haven't done very many at all, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. so, give them some credit. we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either. i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there, but i over look that to find the best points of this movie, the emotions displayed and whatnot. therefore, i have given, and always shall give, this movie a 10 out of 10.

i must admit - the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a *huge* fan of hyde. i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were, shall we say, pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story. i mean, the synopsis sounded really out there. and now that i have just finished watching it - i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance! hyde and gackt both gave heart-wrenching performances, and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie. you get sucked into the story, and you really feel for the characters by the end. the element of vampirism - which i love, but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with - is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic, normal to this setting, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. i ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first...and then i went back and tried to think of why i wasn't giving it that last point. came up with nothing. so a ten out of ten it is. after all - i'm not much of a critic - the fact that i'm bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it. you can tell what side i'm on with moon child.

i must admit, at first i wasn't expecting anything good, at all. i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackt's and hyde's image, but i'm glad to say it has much more to offer.yes, the acting is not that great, but it doesn't suck either, all the cast's well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters. effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough.what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline, although it merges fantastic elements, it also displays a crude reality. the developing of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that's the key of this movie. it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst.it fulfills any expectations for a good drama. i would definitely recommend it to everyone.

when i first heard about moon child, i thought it was a joke. after a few months, i figured i guess it's for real. the few reviews i read that weren't made by squealing fangirls were not very promising.when i was given the opportunity to watch it, i was fully prepared to groan, wince, and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness.i was more than a little surprised, and in a good way.yes, moon child has its moments of cheese, camp, and general dorkiness -- i think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves gackt camui, a man not known for his sanity -- but all in all, it was wholly enjoyable.no, it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very, very heartfelt, amusing, with fun choreography, a touching score, and a fun cast. i know little of japanese cinema so i can't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience, i was rather impressed.if you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, see this film. at least rent it since it's coming to region 1.on a side note, there is zero homosexual/homoerotic content in this film. i didn't even see much of a subtext. don't let people that read too much into things ruin this for you.

i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were, nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and i'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it. i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it over embellish that fact. the characters all had human traits. the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. i give this movie two thumbs so far up. definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years.

this is what i call a "pre sci fi; sci fi" movie. it gets no better than lugosi/karloff in this incredibly good "mood" type motion picture. these two genuine artists are at their very best, as is the story line.karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity, pride, and scientific competition. i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts. i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in. this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake. this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role. it might be possible to do it almost as good.this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced. as i said..it gets no better. no way.

so many consider the black cat as the best karloff/lugosi collaboration. i disagree. the invisible ray is their best. a great storyline, fantastic special effects, and classic karloff over-acting. i love it!!

"the invisible ray" is part science fiction and part horror. it was also the third of seven karloff/lugosi features. in this entry the dominant role goes to boris karloff.through specially designed astronomical equipment, dr. janos rukh (karloff) demonstrates to colleagues dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), sir frances stevens (walter kingsford), his wife lady stevens (beulah bondi) and their nephew ronald drake (frank lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the african continent many millions of years in the past. rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to africa to find the mysterious element.rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names "radium x". due to rukh's long absences, his comely young wife diana (frances drake) becomes attracted to drake and the two fall in love. meanwhile rukh becomes contaminated by radium x to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. the contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.rukh goes to benet for help. benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.while rukh is continuing his work, sir frances takes news of the discovery back to france. diana and ronald accompany him. when benet informs him of this action, rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. when he returns to france he learns of the healing power of radium x as he cures his mother's (violet kemble cooper) blindness and of benet's work in curing the maladies of his patients.but rukh's madness intensifies. first he murders an innocent man whom is identified as rukh. upon hearing of rukh's apparent demise, diana and ronald marry. this angers rukh and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition. one night he is lured into a trap set by benet and...........karloff is excellent in the lead role moving from a happily married ambitious scientist to a raving maniac. lugosi has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part.at 79 minutes this film was the second longest of the six karloff/lugosi collaborations. karloff's film all the way.

one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray. boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd (especially the camera technique karloff, as janos rukh, uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and downright laughable, i didn't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. the effects are done well for the time, the acting is great, and the finish is particularly strong. it reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s, complete with ray guns and ridiculous science. you must watch this movie!

really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest, boris karloff and bela lugosi. dr. janos rukh(karloff)is on an expedition in africa trying to find an ancient meteorite. after finding it, rukh is poisoned by the its radiation. all he touches dies and the dark side of rukh makes him become an egotistic murderer. his friend, dr. felix benet(lugosi)finds a limited remedy to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases. the two fiends will battle over the radiations possibilities. pretty good special effects. others in the cast: frances drake, frank lawton, beulah bondi and frank reicher.

the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial. karloff plays dr. janos rukh, creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the carpathian mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe.before several guests, including lugosi as dr. benet, an astro-chemist who had previously scoffed at rukh's theories, he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element, here termed "radium x", contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago. karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories, but radium x is a tricky compound - it levels mountains at long range, and cures blindness at short range. rukh is careless, however, and poisons himself, glowing in the dark rather like those old ready breck commercials! dr. benet is on hand to devise a counter-active for the radiation, but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid. convinced he has been cheated, he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris, including his estranged wife, and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death...along the way we get the old pseudo-scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer (a remarkably distinct karloff!) and the radium x device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members. and even a touch of james whale in a cockney landlady in paris!the invisible ray is great fun, aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris. the film lacks pace, but is always absorbing. karloff slightly overdoes his performance but lugosi is terrific. universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster, this time with lon chaney jr. as the glowing menace (this time caused by electricity) and lionel atwill as a much madder doctor than lugosi is here. the invisible ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire. not as famous as other universal horrors, perhaps, but it works and is highly entertaining.

horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre-lover to watch a film, and, even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci-fi/horror gem. while lambert hillyer's "the invisible ray" of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff ("frankenstein, "bride of frankenstein", "the mummy",...) or lugosi ("white zombie", "island of the lost souls", "dracula",...), or both ("the black cat", "the raven",...), this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing. compared to other universal horror pictures, the storyline seems a bit silly, but in a delightful manner. karloff and lugosi, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography. karloff plays dr. janos rukh, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago. stunned by rukh's invention, the celebrated french scientist dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor. in africa, rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike... it is somewhat odd that karloff, who was in fact british, plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi, who was hungarian, plays a french scientist, but they are both excellent as usual. as far as i am concerned, these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory, and i am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the horror genre, and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre. by the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff. frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh's beautiful young wife. the rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. other than the casting of karloff and lugosi, the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline. my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance. he is fantastic as always, but his role could have been bigger, and more sinister. otherwise, "the invisible ray" is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror/sci-fi cinema, and a must-see for all my fellow lugosi/karloff fans.

scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. all (pseudo)science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there, including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed. when he summons his rivals -who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they propose a 'joint' expedition to africa...of course they end up stealing much of dr. rukh's original discovery, giving him only residual credit. in addition to that, an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst abbot&costello (lawton) literally steals dr. rukh's young trophy wife (drake), who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being. having grown horns like a deer wasn't going to make dr. rukh (karloff) any friendlier, so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission...killing 2 of his foes and friendly dr. benet (lugosi), the only one who had helped him...finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but ( to my utmost dissatisfaction ) sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married. acting is mostly fine, with karloff & lugosi being very good. check the hysterical chambermaid scene... other characters aren't worth mentioning... recommended, much like all old universal horrors...

prof. janos rukh (boris karloff) discovers radium x--a powerful force to be used for atomic power. unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death. dr. felix benet (bela lugosi) develops an antidote--but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him.the plot is silly and the "effects" that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable, but this is still a fun little chiller. it moves quickly, has some great atmosphere (notice rukh's "house" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and karloff and lugosi (as always) give great performances. there is also good acting by franic drake (as rukh's wife) and violet kemble cooper (as his mother). so it's ok but just a notch below all the other karloff/lugosi movies. the plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. still i did like this. i give it a 7.

the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein; and there's a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and the invisible ray is certainly one of them. the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director lambert hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film. the plot focuses on the good hearted dr janos rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth. his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it. however, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him mad...the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - boris karloff and bela lugosi, and both give excellent performances. karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with. bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in, and it's a great performance from him also; it's nice to see a bit of versatility from lugosi. the film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up. the second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well. the film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely. overall, the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but it's a very good one and comes recommended.

boris and bela do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.i saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from borders this year. this time watching it with my children,i took note of 2 things: it held the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it.very swift story with an unpredictable end. a must for movie buffs!!!

there are so many good things to say about this “b” movie.“b’ maybe in connections, but not in commission. this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen. a grade a effort by universal. the script is well done, imaginative, and without fault. writing credits: howard higgin original story & douglas hodges story, john colton (screenplay). director lambert hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well. no skimping on the loads of extras and locations. i loved beulah bondy (jimmy stewarts mother in “it’s a wonderful life”. the fem lead, frances drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her karloff husband. lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in. as i said there were so many good things: the african discovery of the radium “x”, the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the ten little indians in and then there were none (agatha christie) (the barry fitzgerald version)), the glowing of karlof in the dark. karloff’s mother played by violet kemble cooper with elegance. and because of all these virtues, i found myself believing in the science it portrayed. i guess that’s the mark of a good piece of art.

for real film people, this film is a must, since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. janos rukh/boris karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. this light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good. on the one hand it blinds his mother, on the other it is used to cure blindness ("i can see!" shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected). when rukh/karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are out).there is a wonderful passage near the beginning where karloff/rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years, as the light from andromeda was emitted from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. there are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the persona of beulah bondi/arabella stevens; and religion, emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun. one has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in germany at the time, and particularly at riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm:triumph of the will. happily in the end, mother (violet kemble cooper) intervenes, reminding janos rukh of the first rule of science. if only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout: "i can see!"

while not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as the black cat and the body snatcher), this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd. boris karloff plays dr. janos rukh, a weird scientist who lives in the carpathian mountains--near where the dracula character's home town. bela lugosi plays dr. benet--whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french. i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles, as the carpathian role seems tailor made for lugosi--especially with his accent. however, despite this unusual twist, the two still did excellent jobs. karloff's was definitely the lead role, but lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person--something he didn't play very often in films!! it seems that dr. rukh is a bit of a pariah, as other scientists (especially benet) think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical. however, over the course of the film, rukh turns out to be right and benet is especially generous in his new praise for rukh. but, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (don't you hate it when that happens?). while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story, the plot was well constructed, the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting.this film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger-budget film instead of the cheap quickies both lugosi and karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. good stuff.

okay, note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd-collections: i truly am grateful and i hugely support the initiative, but  have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection? when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role ("tower of london", "the strange door"). "the invisible ray", however, is part of the bela lugosi collection and here it's actually boris karloff who overshadows bela! this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead! bela lugosi's character is quite possibly the most good-natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here. "the invisible ray" features three main chapters. the first one, set in dr. janos rukh's carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience, but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film. dr. rukh (karloff) demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues (among them bela lugosi as dr. benet) how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self-manufactured device. the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa. there dr. rukh isolates himself from the group, discovers the essential element "radium x" to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself. the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one, as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks (melting statues) and a surprising climax. karloff glows in the dark and, convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life, he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch. the narrative structure of "the invisible ray" sounds rather complicated, but the film is easy to follow and entertaining. the story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director lambert hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense. boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi, even though he deserved to have a little more screen time. their scenes together are the highlights of the film, along with the funky images of the glowing boris.

with a special telescope, dr. janos rukh (boris karloff) successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in africa containing an unknown, but extremely powerful element. dr. benet(bela lugosi) form an expedition led by rukh to locate the element. unexpectedly, rukh discovers "radium x,", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them. the sparks really fly between lugosi and karloff in this classic science-fiction film during the post-world war ii era. director hillyer used a few standing sets from "flash gordon" series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from frankenstein. universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film. karloff and lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations.

boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together, but on the whole (interestingly enough) karloff usually is the better man of the two. the real exception is "the black cat" (1934) where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult, and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life. but more usual is "black friday", where (whatever his motive) karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug. in "the raven" lugosi is a sadistic surgeon, who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough. rarely are they both negative characters totally. in "the body snatcher", karloff does kill lugosi, but lugosi is trying to blackmail him.the one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film, which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned. in it karloff's dr. janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the "official scientific community" for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago. he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens (walter kingsford and beulah bondi), and has another scientist, a frenchman named dr. felix benet (lugosi), rukh's young wife diane (frances drake) and a friend and protégée of the stevenses named ronald drake (frank lawton).before they leave, rukh is warned by his mother (violet kemble cooper) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy. he tries to dismiss this, but he is worried by what she says, his scientific standing, and whether or not he is going to get his due credit.what he gets is a disaster. he finds the substance, but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity. he finds that he is slowly burning up, and if he tries to touch people or animals they die. he's actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet, who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger. but there are two things that are unbeatable here. the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time, and has to be replenished. and the radioactivity has affected rukh's brain. he is increasingly jealous of diane's friendship with ronald (encouraged, unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella), and he is equally upset that (due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that) benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that "radium x" is giving to man. soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives, ending with his own.the film certainly picked up on science to an extent. madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium. few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936, but some idea of it was coming out. the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a "curse" on the expedition. of course, with the idea of a "cursed" expedition (on the continent of africa) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago, financed by a titled englishman, we have entered archeology not physics or geology (paging howard carter and lord carnaevon).on the other hand, benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths, and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england. during the whitechapel murders, sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper. it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. but the idea did not die. jules verne used it in his novel "the brothers kip" in 1899, and here dr. benet uses it. as this is a science fiction story, he finds the image of rukh on the the plate, but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters.the film is good on many grounds, the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other. there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films. the other performances are good as well, in particular ms kemble cooper. she is best remembered as basil rathbone's frightening sister (jane murdstone) in "david copperfield". here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end, and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target.

there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s, the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films. after being universal's "first monster" in the seminal classic, "dracula", bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent (sadly, this last factor would also led him to be type-casted during the 40s). in the same way, boris karloff's performance in james whale's "frankenstein" transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster. of course, it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen, and the movie that united them was 1934's "the black cat". this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade, and director lambert hillyer's mix of horror and science fiction, "the invisible ray", is another of those minor classics they did in those years.in "the invisible ray", dr. janos rukh (boris karloff) is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda. while showing his invention to his colleagues, dr. felix benet (bela lugosi) and sir francis stevens (walter kingsford), they discover that thousands of years ago, a meteor hit in what is now nigeria. after this marvelous discovery, dr. rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa, looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor. this expedition won't be any beneficial for rukh, as during the expedition his wife diane (frances drake) will fall in love with ronald drake (frank lawton), an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition. however, rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip, as he'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor.written by john colton (who previously did the script for "werewolf of london"), "the invisible ray" had its roots on an original sci-fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges. given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi, colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story, playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up. one element that makes "the invisible ray" to stand out among other horror films of that era, is the way that colton plays with morality through the story. that is, there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style, but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices. in many ways, "the invisible ray" is a modern tragedy about obsessions, guilt and revenge.a seasoned director of low-budget b-movies, filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles. thanks to his experience working with limited resources, hillyer's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains, and "the invisible ray" was not an exception. while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films, hillyer's movie effectively captures the essence of colton's script, as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci-fi. finally, a word must be said about hillyer's use of special effects: for an extremely low-budget film, they look a lot better than the ones in several a-movies of the era.as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff, the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality. as the film's protagonist, boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes. as his colleague, dr. benet, bela luogis is simply a joy to watch, stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was. as rukh's wife, frances drake is extremely effective, truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress. still, two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh, and beulah bondi as lady arabella, as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time, making unforgettable their supporting roles. frank lawton is also good in his role, but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast.if one judges this movie under today's standards, it's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience. however, that would be a mistake, as despite its low-budget, it is remarkably well done for its time. on the top of that, considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept, it's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate. one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters, specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr. rukh and the cold dr. benet, as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors.while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the "frankenstein" movies, nor the elegant suspense of "the black cat", lambert hillyer's "the invisible ray" is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures' catalog of horror films. with one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror, this mixture of suspense, horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had: boris karloff and bela lugosi. 8/10

the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi. karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even his wife. his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends. this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. it is hard, however to hear his accent and believe he is french. the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science" but, in a way, even the junk science makes it work well. since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are as "relevant" today as they were when the movie was made. and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be. this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again. i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times. the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing. i highly recommend it.

this is just about in the same league as `the black cat', although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9+. that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing!`the invisible ray' is part horror, part drama and certainly part sci-fi. for a movie made in 1936 the sci-fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. the mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend, while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better.director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often. what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot. the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. it's a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre.as with `the black cat' and `island of lost souls', i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd. when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling.anyway, watch this film if you get the chance. when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library.

one doesn't get to enjoy this gem, the 1936 invisible ray, often. but no can forget it. the story is elegant. karloff, austere and embittered in his carpathian mountain retreat, is janos rukh, genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in africa. joining him is the ever-elegant lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "astro-chemistry." frances drake is the lovely, underused young wife; frank lawton the romantic temptation; and the divine violet kemble cooper is mother rukh, in a performance worthy of maria ospenskya.the story moves swiftly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still handsome. it also contains some wonderful lines. one rukh restores his mother's sight, he asks, "mother, can you see, can you see?" "yes, i can seemore clearly than ever. and what i see frightens me." even better when mother rukh says, "he broke the first law of science." i am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is.this movie is definitely desert island material.

karloff and lugosi - together again! this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much. it's not an all-out horror film like the duo's previous two hits, the black cat and the raven. but, it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when re-visited.the invisible ray was directed by lambert hillyer, a director who mainly made westerns, but curiously in these final days of the laemmles' reign at universal, he found himself helming this and the laemmles' final horror film, dracula's daughter. both are crisp, clean-cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements.just as lugosi went wild in the raven, much needs to be said of karloff's hamming in the invisible ray. the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that karloff's character, rukh, acts so madly before he is poisoned by radium x, that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing. this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining - he's basically a loony right from the start. there isn't any real transformation. same here. halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind. i still enjoyed his performance, though, just as i did lugosi's over-the-top antics in the raven.meanwhile, lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained, and thoughtful turn as rukh's rival in science, dr. benet. lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh, of which i am in alignment with horror film writer john soister on - "and if he (rukh) touches anyone?" the inspector inquires. lugosi hesitatingly replies, in a way that only lugosi could deliver, "they die". just as lugosi could be so off, he could also be more perfect than any actor. this is one of those moments.therefore, karloff and lugosi's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff pared off against the cool logic of lugosi. karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times, however, one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one. he only had one more chance (ninotchka).the invisible ray is a fun film, and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans. it is one of those films that improves on each viewing, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story complements the darker, more horrific pairings they had. the special effects, by the always innovative john fulton, are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate. frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman, something seldom seen in classic horror films. the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film. a terrific, fun film!

fatal error is a really cool movie! robert wagner, antonio sabato jr., janine turner, jason schombing, malcolm stewart, and david lewis are in the film. the movie's cast all acted really well. robert wagner played his role good. the relationship between saboto jr. and turner was a nice one. there maybe a big age difference there but they are a unique couple. the two actors really worked together rather well. the music in the film is really good by ron ramin and fits the flick very well. there is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie which you don't know what is going on and what is going to happen next and this movie keeps you going from beginning to end. if you like robert wagner, antonio sabato jr., and janine turner then watch this excellent movie!

i really liked this movie despite one scene that was pretty bad (the one when samantha and nick are flirting in the hotel). the story is so cool and can't wait to read the book! bravo for the super station!

the way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the x-files continues without mulder and scully, these would be a pretty good replacement duo.

the movie wasn't all that great. the book is better. but the movie wasn't all that bad either. it was interesting to say the least. the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldn't say i was actually interested in the movie itself. janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching :)they have a few cute scene's that should appeal to the romantic's. overall i'd give the movie a 7 or 8. it wasn't bad, just a little lacking plot wise.

and a made for tv movie too, this movie was good. the acting in it and the plot was just so great. this one of the only movies i've seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen. there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie, but it's very easily over looked.antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner. this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful. after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on (four times) and it too kicked was great. if you ever see this movie come on tv, i'd watch it. the effects in this movie were pretty well done, i honestly don't know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldn't suck so bad.watch it. it's really good, no really, it is!

for a danish movie, i have to say, that this is very good movie.it's in a class of its own, yet it has an international potential.the movie has a big budget, and is starring famous danish actors, and a few newcomers, who play very well. it can be watched by anyone who like adventures, and a little bit of 'ghost' movie.don't be afraid, be thrilled!

wow! a danish movie with this kind of content? i mean, the actors, the story, the pictures, the efx - everything was where it should be. and a danish efx house producing those vfx - wow! this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that quality.*spoiler ahead* the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good, but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghost-movie. *end of spoiler*but anyway, this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud of.the only "bad" about this, is that it wasn't a danish director, but a swedish...

i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister. instead, i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared. in many ways still a children´s story, but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential. could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers***this movie, "the divers", is really interesting. all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history, underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish. but i decided to check it out for one reason, the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine. i've got a fetish for german subs, especially wrecks that can be dived upon. so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part, but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part. knowing that nordic films aren't always that good and not sure of the budget size i was, to say the least, very sceptical.upon viewing i was ... surprised.i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate, seeing how some are very young, the two main actors in particular. this was not an issue, they both perform very well. as do the other actors, who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond. this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old, not often seen on the screen. not unique in anyway, but somewhat rare. and it's all good.as for the danish language, it is nearly impossible to understand. but this was no problem, it had subtitles.another issue was the submarine itself, i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine. having decided their budget was slim, i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst. again i was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. having a fetish for german subs, i knew what the sub should look like, especially inside, and was not let down. the team has done some serious research. it's all good.i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a "warning". the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war. it's a special purpose sub. but to give you a hint of what to expect, it's a crossing between a type vii, type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i-52. it's god a good design and makes a nice wreck.the setting is on a danish island or peninsula, i can't remember. it's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. their grandfather is a mariner of sorts. the cinematography is quite nice, a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks, some newfound teenage love, nice diving weather and a general feeling of "perfect". once again, it's all good.plot-wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind, a gathering of men hire one of the boats, an old minesweeper and it's crew. one of the visitors, a man in his 50's, has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back. the island's senior citizens all remember when a german u-boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths. the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945. no submarine was ever found.what to expectkey elements are nazi experiments, nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy, and ...a surprise.*** warning - spoiler ***i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard. not being a big fan of supernatural events, it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem. it's not like "from dusk til dawn" where everybody turns into vampires towards the end. this is a bit more subtle.overall : really good movie, i gave it an 8. some due to the fact that it isn't a hollywood movie with unlimited resources. i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans. but even if this had been a hollywood production, i would give it a 7 or 8. definately worth your while. yes, a child's story in a way, but then again a mature tale. it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure, which i found very appealing. and, again, the cinematography is really nice./medusa 2001

this is a bad movie in the traditional sense, but taken for what it is meant to be it is quite good. very funny and well made, although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste, what with jiggling breasts as a girl suffocates and so on.

i can't understand why many imdb users don't like this movie. why they think it's sooooo bad etc. it's not worse than anything else out there. personally i think "soldier" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre.reasons why i liked "soldier": kurt russel, connie nielsen, jason scott lee, the script (david webb peoples), great visual effects, and the directing (paul anderson).i even think that this is the best work i've seen from director paul anderson, who has previously directed the entertaining "mortal kombat" and the not so entertaining "event horizon".

i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies. kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays. but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie. oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie. if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel. i give soldier *** 1/2 out of *****

i loved this movie and will watch it again. original twist to plot of man vs man vs self. i think this is kurt russell's best movie. his eyes conveyed more than most actors words. perhaps there's hope for mankind in spite of government intervention?

i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video. i am a big nut for sci-fi action flicks though anyway.without giving any of the story away, it is worth seeing if you like sci-fi without requiring much thought. the story is basic, and the plot is very good. worth your time to see!maybe they will make a sequel? :)8 out of 10

i really liked this movie. kurt manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves. he doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action. he is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny.

of course, by any normal standard of film criticism, soldier is a very poor film indeed. kurt russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a gladiators contest without the crash mats.abandoned on a junk planet, he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. kurt doesn't talk much. finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. kurt gets angry and kills everyone. a planet gets totalled. the end.unless the academy start a new category for "best explosion", soldier is not going to win any awards. however, as ludicrous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience. the military hardware is the coolest since aliens (the apc's especially) and, at 90 minutes long, it doesn't outstay its welcome. please note that the below mark is only a guide. knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns.7 out of 10

i have to say i quite enjoyed soldier. russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity. very watchable and nowhere near as bad as i'd been led to believe. yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment.

interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to. however, i'll try. this was a very good action film with some great set pieces. you'll note i specified the genre. i didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation, and i didn't berate the acting. enjoy if for what it is people, a well above average action film. i could go on but i've made my comment.

soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be. i found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in paul verhoven's starship troopers. the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere.one particular trivia-bit stands out for me - todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate. for the oblivious ones out there, tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty's elegiac last lines in blade runner. to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least. maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic?i'll give this one 3 out of 5.

this movie is ok if you like mindless action ,corny acting, and a very small plot !the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of"event horizon". the costumes are like something from a mad max movie .none of the soldiers talk ,so others tell them what to do.it eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place. i personally liked russell better in "tango and cash""escape from la/new york" and "executive decision". it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie!!

i've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit--which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing.first of all, this movie attempts "serious" science-fiction, social commentary, more than action-adventure. there is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. if you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad "aliens" clone. but, again, that's not what it's about.the movie is really about todd's (kurt russell) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly *back*). but because it's not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer, kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. and he really does a wonderful job--it can take two viewings to appreciate it.the surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.

what a perfect example of "less is more..." kurt russell (sgt. todd) only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words. what a challenge! like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotive gesture, all combines to make a stronger impact. this is one of those top 5 movies i can't live without, right up there with the classics like road warrior. if you liked this, check out "mad max 2, the road warrior" and "braveheart" both starring mel gibson. also "gladiator" with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also. the "thirteenth warrior" starring antonio banderas and "blade runner" starring harrison ford.

i fell in love with this silent action drama. kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well. raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, todd (kurt russell) is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers.the stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born - soldier. not rambo, not schwarzenegger, not bruce willis, not mel gibson, not jason statham - kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his - original, daring, and all too human. i miss the fact that sequels were never made.10/10-ld_________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this was excellent. touching, action-packed, and perfect for kurt russel. i loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. this movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend. i cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. the ending wasn't twisty, but it was still excellent. if you like escape from new york, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you. not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect. something for everyone.

stoic and laconic soldier sergeant todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant colonel mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by jason isaacs), who has todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants. todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. director paul w.s. anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by david webb peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. moreover, anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. bang-up supporting turns by jason scott lee as brutish rival soldier caine 607, connie nielson as the compassionate sandra, sean pertwee as the kindly mace, jared and taylor thorne as mute little boy nathan, gary busey as crusty seasoned veteran captain church, michael chiklis as the jolly johnny pig, and brenda wehle as the sensible mayor hawkins. better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might. david tattersall's polished cinematography, joel mcneely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing.

kurt russell is so believable and the action so non-stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest-to-goodness important themes [overcoming fear of the stranger, learning to rise above early conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the storyline. this is so very rare for a 'guy's action flick' that even i [who thinks most a/a is violent pap] liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i know.....it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action-adventure box office hits -- it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non-stop action moments. i'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it. anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi-layered, multi-themed beauty or not care about it. this film could convert anyone who avoids a/a as mindless violence. if a guy takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a cable listing] to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks.

nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russell's career.i have my reasons.firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of russell's interpretation of todd, the eponymous soldier. i'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting i've seen russell pull off. todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.the portrayal is spot on. todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. he suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. his hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood. many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.todd's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. fear and discipline we are told. always. fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsen's sandra - but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - fear and discipline indeed.then there is the subtext of his abandonment (twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in our world, in his it can only be worse. russell quickly picks up the mantle of mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death.then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between busey's church and the hotshot from hq, mekum. mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. any one of them could pound todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them. an incentivized todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance. it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.there are many other subtle themes. when a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you.

this is a great movie. it has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. this takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.the story is very well done and there are no holes. kurt russell is a solider named todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives. eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. jason scott lee being one of them. as a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like todd. they test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle russell is injured and assumed to be dead. the military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that russell is alive.todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on. for a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. he rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people. when they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.just as russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. what the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like todd and the other old soldiers. so while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than todd, todd easily outsmarts them. the military starts realizing this and todd kills all of their men but one. that one is jason scott lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between russell and scott lee. russell obviously comes out on top.this is one of the best action films i've ever seen and i've seen a lot. this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines. the writer also didn't forget that russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women "sir". there are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining.an awesome one man army action film for fans of rambo, commando and missing in action. this is highly recommended for all kurt russell fans and action/sci-fi fans.

soldier may not have academy acting or lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me. i won't tell you what its about, i'm sure you already read the summary. this is a great doomed futureistic action/science fiction movie. kurt russell doesn't say much, he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character. there are great action and fight scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but thats hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives. i have not seen soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites. i'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy/sci-fi movies.

in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, breed to be expendable warriors. but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is, " you should have made them smart as well as fast". kurt russell did a incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined. even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when he is given a hug, and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself, and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier.

the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the -thematic- conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between todd and his bio-engineered replacement. both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.peoples' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half-way through the movie, which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp.nonetheless, kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little.not a great film, but one worth seeing.

ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence. you can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot. kurt russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding. recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!

i watched this movie expecting what i got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. what really surprised me was that kurt russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue, and because you are playing a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! howzat? kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. in spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, russell pulls off an incredible characterization. his robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints. great job!as usual, jason isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. connie nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous. i'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eyes off her. unfortunately, gary busey's role was too small and limited. much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling, i don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. by the end of the story the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. yes!the sort of feeb who thinks that russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point.

when i rented this movie to watch it, i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie. instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating. and you know what it worked. kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was. i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film.

i don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here. i only saw it when it came onto cable. the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was.i'm certainly happy it was'nt - kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. the scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner, alien, silent running, logan's run or thx1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest i've seen to it in a long time.he changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack arnie one liners, he does'nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending.that's why this film did'nt do well. it did'nt follow formula, and among a 18-25 year old target american audience, that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.fear and discipline.always.

kurt russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action-thriller from paul anderson (event horizon, resident evil.) set on a garbage-dump planet, soldier plays like a cross between rambo and shane, with russell barely speaking as the title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for dead. the supporting cast of colonists, including connie nielsen, sean pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute michael chiklis, is able. they spend most of the movie being scared of russell, and the rest of it running for their lives. russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. with almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances. it is almost a mime performance. when the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass--and does so in a strong, silent, matter-of fact way. there are flaws. jason scott lee is brutish as a "superior" genetic soldier. jason isaacs does a great impression of frank burns from m*a*s*h as a weaselly commanding officer, and gary busey busts a gut (and nearly busts his girdle) as todd's mentor. this is an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of blade runner--david webb peoples wrote both screenplays.

david webb peoples meets paul anderson...if it already sounds weird to you, then you are right, because it is.peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc... he covered these issues in bladerunner, unforgiven, and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines.paul anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. not surprisingly so have all of his other movies! and here is a violent thriller with moral implications!peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie. soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill, and never had a normal life. they are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead. there he must cope with a group of refugees, some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. but then......the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. big, violent, loud action ensues and peoples' script turns into an anderson action-fest. it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the end product is better then i expected. entertaining, somewhat, though admittedly not very, thought-provoking, and exciting once the action starts. 7/10rated r: a lot of violence

in a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. they are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. this is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `soldier,' directed by paul anderson and starring kurt russell. the scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. russell is sergeant todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. but even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when todd and his peers are no longer the elite. a new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and todd's generation is suddenly obsolete. what follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: fear and discipline. russell gives a commanding performance as todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. he has few lines in this movie, but russell speaks volumes with his eyes. this role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before. and he's given todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. notable performances are also turned in here by connie nielsen (sandra) and jason isaacs (colonel mekum). rounding out the supporting cast are jason scott lee, memorable as caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; sean pertwee (mace); gary busey (captain church); michael chiklis (jimmy pig); and mark bringleson (rubrick). anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. it's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference. much like `1984,' and `mad max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of universe in which we all must live together and share. i rate this one 7/10.

ok, so soldier isn't deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable.the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnie's in the t films (and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).so to the film itself, a reasonable us/brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not. the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe escape from la - sequels are such fickle creatures!). sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci-fi lineage. and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance. i don't think you will be disappointed.

soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons. but i liked soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me.first, the art direction is tight and well executed. as far as science fiction backdrops go, soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre. the sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; i didn't love all of their future military style, but i was impressed with the effort. for me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.second, i'm a kurt russell fan. i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films. soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero. it's not an award winning role, but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog.third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. this isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.if you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice. just don't expect the next bladerunner.

its time to pay tribute to the great charton heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one. his other films of a past generation were ben hur, the ten commandents, omega man and planet of the apes were his better works.this film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth , in 2022, that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called "soylent green" which is manufactured with human flesh. this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes india's population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it.charlton heston's character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism.unfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they deliver is not the greens party of today's ethos thank god. cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in new zealand , fiji and borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization.another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made.the film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great edward g. robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons.this is a dud of a film and i wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or charlton heston fans. all the other reviews of this film i have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the usa in which an ecological disaster has occurred.the only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.

in terms of the arts, the 1970s were a very turbulent era. in literature and the visual arts, it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted. in music it was a decade that many see as a low point, due to corporate rock and disco. on television it was a golden age for situation comedies, from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to m*a*s*h to all in the family, but in film it was even a greater period of creativity, in all genres, that saw the rise of the american auteur- directors like robert altman, francis ford coppola, and martin scorsese- from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century. these directors wanted to craft literate, arts films for the masses, of the sort that had been staples in europe since the end of the second world war. yet, the studios were trying to keep pace, with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s.but, unlike the films of the 1930s, starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield (usually co-starring the dead end kids), that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way, or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage, the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films, which allowed the left wing of hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment. there was precedent for this approach, for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the mccarthy era- most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body snatchers. and the early 1960s saw rod serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone. among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive silent running; george lucas's first film thx 1138, which dealt with consumerism, group think, and existentialism; and logan's run, which hammered away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual. some of the film's references are quite heavyhanded- and reek of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant inflation. a few jarred strawberries cost $150, and soylent rations its assorted colored foods- soylent yellow, soylent red, and the new soylent green, reputedly made from 'the finest undersea growth,' in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time. scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film's release, and the scenes of crowding, and bodies, live and dead, lying all about are still chilling, as well as influential. a later film like escape from new york is an obvious progeny. the rest of the script, by stanley r. greenberg, however, is rather pedestrian, and fairly standard for a dystopian flick, but fleischer and cinematographer richard h. kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds, to spice things up. the use of soft, dimly lit visuals, murkily filtered, add a stygian feel to the new york of the film, almost like a colorized version of carl theodor dreyer's vampyr. the only light in the film comes from artificial sources, and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless.the end of the film, where thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into soylent green wafers, is both chilling, and oddly drama-less. in the end, the soylent minions hunt thorn down, but he survives long enough to utter the film's catchphrase to chief hatcher. yet, one does not know if it is enough, for hatcher has already been co-opted, and has a track record of taking the easy way out. yet, that fact, and its ambiguity, shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters' dilemmas, and has a depth many later, better made films, sci fi or not, do not have. it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching.

"soylent green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. this film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic. the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company. charlton heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... the script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. the riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. edward g. robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for joseph cotton ("baron blood", "the abominable dr. phibes"). this is science-fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! no fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.

in this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies. this is amusing at first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances, how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.characters often interact in a peculiar way, with no tact or manners or respect. i believe this is intentional, not bad acting. after all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave like that.i didn't like most of the action scenes, apart the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. the plot isn't too polished. but the great scenes and ideas - like the death of sol, the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with, the "furniture" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film.8 out of 10.

this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, great music, and excellent visuals without significant special effects. it is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. that's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: "1984", "2001: a space odyssey (compare its space station with our international space station) and isaac asimov's "i robot" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's).

soylent green is a classic. i have been waiting for someone to re-do it.they seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days (i.e. war of the worlds)and i am hoping some director/producer will re-do soylent green. with todays computer animation and technology, it would have the potential to be a great picture. anti-utopian films may not be that far-fetched. the human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it. we, as humans, have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand, but there's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves. despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish. classic malthusian economics states that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing....that's obscene.

this movie came to me highly recommended by matt groening. well actually i watched both the simpsons and futurama and it gets a mention in both so i figured "what the heck". the film brings home a few "what if's" that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted. interesting though that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor! nice that those responsible didn't over load the film with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc. some nice looking 'furniture' once you figure out what that means. remember, "tuesday is soylent green day"

in the '70s, charlton heston starred in sci-fi flicks of varying quality. "soylent green" is one of the better ones. he plays robert thorn, a detective in 2022 new york. in this future, most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called soylent green. but when thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product, he finds himself on the run.i guess that it's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays. but even so, it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture. also starring leigh taylor-young, chuck connors, brock peters, joseph cotten and edward g. robinson (in his final role).

i've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s; some horrendously bad, and others thought provoking and truly frightening. soylent green fits into the latter category. yes, at times it's a little campy, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some of the film seems awfully prescient. here we have a film, 9 years before blade runner, that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark, scary, and nihilistic. both charlton heston and edward g. robinson fare far better in this than the ten commandments, and robinson's assisted-suicide scene is creepily prescient of kevorkian and his ilk. some of the attitudes are dated (can you imagine a filmmaker getting away with the "women as furniture" concept in our oh-so-politically-correct-90s?), but it's rare to find a film from the me decade that actually can make you think. this is one i'd love to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, i don't think the overall scope of this film would receive its due. check it out.

this is a great movie but there could be more about soylent green. there should be more scenes of what they do to people. how people act in 2022. i think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond. even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie. so go rent or buy this movie right now!!

not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary. but clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition.we should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment. but, didn't we say this of "1984" ? had james orwell known the internet becoming reality not long after 1984; in fact it was in 1994; he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did. hindsight rewarded.it doesn't matter. what does matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a "love apple" when necessity knocks at our door. a snapshot of ourselves at old age.whatever the time-line will prove to be for us, i know for a fact we haven't seen the beginning of it yet.

especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed (1973), this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong. too many people, and nothing works. the only people who can live in comfort are the rich. it's set in new york in 2022 (i think), and it reminds you of your worst vision of calcutta.i got to appreciate charlton heston's acting after seeing him in orson welles' touch of evil. he was (maybe is) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi-heroic people. here, he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt (taking rare food treats from the rich), and being totally corrupt (actively condoning evil). the movie all seems to take place at night, and sweat is dripping off everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. even though i hadn't seen it before, i knew the famous ending (which will not here be revealed), but the ending is certainly foreshadowed.great scenes with edward g. robinson: going to the council (made up of elderly jews with heavy accents, so it seems), where the truth is revealed. and then going off to the thanatopsis to check out.gritty, pre-star wars dystopian science fiction.

my evaluation: 8/10i like a lot this movie. compare to today brainless movie (just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas), "soylent green" ask to something that today doesn't exist anymore: to think.well it would not a big surprise a day human eat "cookies" which are create with body of human. with all what happen on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible.sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again. rich at paradise, other in the hell. well a luck today they are tv and idiocy like "reality show".tv is a good wash brain. it's pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like technologies. since writing all stop.if you like reality show this movie is not for you. if you believe all politician same too. if you don't like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie.

soylent green i found to be an excellent movie.if you like logan's run you'll like this.yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as "cheesy" but the story is excellent.the story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant.at the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace.it's nearest modern day equivalent would be "dark angel" in terms of how the us is shown to be third-world country.

is this the future that awaits us? an overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? this film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much. it had likable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline, and the macho-est macho man out there: charleton heston. richard fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feel. you're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants.the characters are wonderful. charleton heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, is thorn. the man created this role of badass, yet likable tough-guy. i could definitely put myself in thorn's shoes. he sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead. edward g. robinson (in his last film, r.i.p.) plays the lovable old sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. everyone else is great, especially leigh taylor-young as shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.the special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. the soylent green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. the polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. the empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.one final note is the ending, which even now still shocked me. it is gruesome, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea.the bottom line: an excellent 70's science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy.

truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening. a world vastly overpopulated, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer, and all our natural resources spent. in this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great charlton heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder, opposite the film noir legend edward g robinson turning in a fine last performance.one of the images that will always stay with me from this film, is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which thorne (heston) has to hop through them every time he uses them.the movie's use of music is note worthy too, although it contains no score in the usual sense, the opening theme is good, and the subsequent snatches of music we here in simonson's apartment, and especially the beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric.

nyc, 2022: the greenhouse effect, vanished oceans, grinding unemployment and scarcity of water, power and food.. and new york's population has topped 40 million. this is a little gem of a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st century citizens. the low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: set to music, a low-tech 'tape-slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973, depicts an unspoiled american pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes. succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise. the police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's tv detective show, and the other interior sets look basic at best. the budget probably all went on trying to 'futurise' the soylent executive's 'chelsea west' apartment with state-of-the art goodies, meaning the other costumes are perfunctory, some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.the memorable scene where sol and thorn (charlton heston) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society: they enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple, and beef, and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges.robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called 'home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors.this is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s. yes, i know we're not eating the dead yet, but with our resource-sapping longevity, spiraling poverty gap, corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change, the lasting prediction of 'soylent green' may come to pass.

the world of the 1973 sci-fi drama soylent green is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful. it is a world in which new york city's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022. overpopulation, air pollution, year-long heat waves, and food shortages are the rule. the only hope comes from a food product called soylent green. but what is this particular food stuff really made of? that question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film, based on harry harrison's 1966 novel "make room! make room!" charlton heston stars as thorne, an nypd detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive (joseph cotten). as it turns out, cotten was on the board of directors of the soylent corporation, the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing. heston believes that this wasn't just a garden-variety murder, that cotten was bumped off for a reason. he gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute "book" (edward g. robinson, in his 101st and final cinematic appearance), and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like. what robinson finds out about soylent green shocks him beyond all imagination; but before he can tell heston all of what he knows, he has himself euthanized. and when heston does indeed find out the secret of soylent green...well, that part has become immortalized into cinematic history.under the very professional guiding hand of director richard fleischer (the boston strangler; fantastic voyage), soylent green is a fairly grim but thought-provoking look at a dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources. indeed, this was a project that heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968, after he had struck gold in the sci-fi genre with planet of the apes--a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra-conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation (after all, soylent green is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism). robinson, as always, is the consummate professional in his last role; the sequence where he is euthanized (as he looks at video of the world from a better era, set to the music of tchaikovsky, beethoven, and grieg) is quite simply heartbreaking. the film also benefits from solid supporting help from chuck connors (as a very convincing heavy), brock peters (as heston's superior), and leigh taylor-young as the woman who tries to help heston in his inquiries.it must seem easy these days to dismiss soylent green for being dated. but those who do it ought to think twice; for this film's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don't watch what we do with what we have today.

the time is the future and for many not aware of it, that day is now. in this final movie for legendary actor, edward g. robinson, "solent green" becomes a landmark classic. many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history. the movie is taken from the novel entitled, 'make room, make room' but who's working title was changed to "solent green." the story concerns the earth as it evolves into the future with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing short of catastrophic. the planet's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple staples. they come in a variety of colors, such as solent yellow, solent red, and now 'solent green.' however there are those who know the 'real' ingredient in solent green and cringe at their own culpability and fear divine retribution. the first is a food executive named william r. simonson (joseph cotton). upon his death, a dedicated police detective called robert thorn (charleston heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. although corruption goes all the way to the top, it begins with simonsons' bodyguard, tad fielding (chuck connors) and security chief donnovan (roy jenson) who target thorn for a waste desposal factory. thorn's boss, lt. hatcher (brock peters) believes his suspicions but warns him of those 'higher and hot' who want the case closed, but thorn will not risk his "job" for an easy way out. what thorn discovers marks him for death, but like the film, awaits a final warning. ****

as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . overpopulation means there`s too many people to feed ? i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . stalin`s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao`s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . and let`s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth , hong kong and macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn`t strictly down to overpopulation - it`s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( it`s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughablebut don`t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the70s . it plays on the contempary audience`s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line " if i could afford it i`d smoke two , maybe three of these a day " . but it`s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that`s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world thorn`s generation has never known . this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth

this was a very thought provoking film, especially for 1973. at the time it was actually a huge box office success. after the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely.it was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time...no one had ever heard of the 'greenhouse effect'before 1985, and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up.the sets and special effects might look a little outdated, but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period. if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense. this is a message movie, not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions.this was also hestons last good film, the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy. after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash. this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made, and the ending might be creepy and depressing, but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this.

the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach. both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms. on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet.maybe there's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now. new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green. environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming. for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck. obviously there's no family planning in this world either.charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g. robinson who's old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck. there's been a murder committed, joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation, a multi-national concern that has come up with a food product, some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population. it's latest product is soylent green.the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man, but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind. as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people, that we've become a race of cannibals, the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative. we've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.this was the farewell performance of edward g. robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views. a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia, he passed away in real life. not many did, but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them.though the timetable was off, it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass. hopefully we'll have not just the intelligence, but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening.

i watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the b side on the omega man dvd. the omega man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later, the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies. but soylent green is in a whole other league. i bet this is one of tarantino's favourites. there are at least 3 scenes in the film that i've never seen anything like before. heston casually getting into bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely unrelated! a whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! a priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this. and what the heck is going on between heston and edward g. robinson? is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? luckily, i saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. then i watched it again, and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. a very nice script - and some great sets too. just when you thought you'd seen everything . . .

this is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. i have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! this is the only movie i know of that has such polarized views based on gender. perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots--but whatever the cause, i have always found this difference fascinating.the film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by charlton heston. this is set in the near future and the head of the huge international soylent corporation has been assassinated. as the film unfolds, you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future american society. the rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including "furniture"--a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). at the same time, the masses are dirt poor, unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed! why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with i really should not discuss--it could ruin the film for you. however, the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. plus, it features edward g. robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to heston. though not for the easily depressed or squeamish, this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound.

very interesting. the big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working. it really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world i live in a lot more. charlton heston does a good job, as do all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film which was surprising. it lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. the main fault that i could find was that i didn't want the film to end when it did, i would have liked to see what happened next.7/10

soylent green is...a really good movie, actually.i never would've thought it. i don't really like heston in his sci-fi efforts. he's one of those actors who, like superman, manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time. i prefer more vulnerable heroes. and indeed, he sneers his way through much of soylent green, too, but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully i don't really mind.i can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie. soylent green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973), and it's lacking in action. but i admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt, and highly stratified society, and i was so pleased to see that edward g. robinson had such a moving, funny final role. nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with heston - really make the movie.the message of soylent green is pretty relevant these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. funny, isn't it, to see heston in a prototype michael moore movie...

i saw soylent green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on t.v. or video. it was always one of my favorite sci-fi and/or charlton heston films.recently, the egyptian theater in l.a. had a twelve film charlton heston retrospective. i flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period. soylent green looked great on the large egyptian screen with a perfect new print. from its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic.charlton heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and eddie robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great.their chemistry together is wonderful. the film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print. fleisher really knows how to fill the screen,and the cinematoraphy, writing, music used, and everything about it works. the film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future. just think how the world population grew, the rain forest that disappeared, resources used up, green house effect getting worse since 1973. i just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years. its reputation should be better.speaking of reputations, often people speak as if charlton heston is not a great actor. seeing him in el-cid, soylent green, the warlord, the omega man, will penny, and major dundee back to back i am convinced he is one of our best actors. of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are.

this was eddie robinson's 101st film and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after shooting was complete. all of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignant.although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated (also note the video game shown in the film), but the subject of the film is pretty much timeless. heston said he had wanted to make the film for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation.several things make this film a classic. the story is solid.the acting is top-notch, especially the interplay between heston and robinson, with nice performances also by cotten and peters.the music is absolutely perfect. the medley of beethoven, grieg, and tchaikovsky combined with the pastoral visual elements make for some truly moving scenes. this was the icing on the cake for the film.and the theme (or the "point") of the film is a significant one. yes, it's a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note it's a cautionary tale about what can go wrong with man's stewardship of earth. it's in the subtext that you find the real message of the film. pay attention to what sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present), and note how thorn is incapable of comprehending what sol is saying.this film is one of my top sci-fi films of all time.

a great film! slow: yes....but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and horrifying, perfectly surreal (feels like a nightmare).i'd compare it to david lynch (eraserhead, inland empire, blue velvet) style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton fink and naked lunch (insects!). also a bit of jodorowsky (fando y lis)....add some night on earth, angel heart and a bit of begotten, pi, (would it be wrong to mention tetsuo?) jacob's ladder, barker's the forbidden and salome - that should form together at least the concept of a dark night... nuit noire.if you're out for avantegardistic and/or surrealistic cinema (like i am) you're gonna like this one. if you're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something else.final words: the plot is very, very strange and unusual and that's probably the #1 reason why most people who don't appreciate this film hate it.

this film is amazing - it's just like a nightmare. the bizarre story, the dark decors, the swarming insects everywhere, the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams... really great! people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. it seems a little to the films of david lynch: the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains. nuit noire contains almost no plot. it's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings, nightmares and meetings. that's a drawback. if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement, i would give it a 10 out of 10. but that's missing, and that's why i gave the movie an 8. nuit noire is a film worth watching. search that dvd and you'll be rewarded!

extremely interesting and intriguing movie. the similarities to david lynch (who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of franz kafka (the house keeper in this film is called mrs. grubach, as is the one in der prozess...) are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of belgium in africa. the exact content of the movie i can not clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well, and his quest for social contact and love. these are the symbolic themes i deduced from the movie, but in fact they're no more than impressions.but even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery (beautiful close ups of beatles, larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style). maybe you can say that i didn't quite 'get' the film, but i have been watching like hypnothised for 1.5 hour, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity.

in my mind, this remains one of the very best depictions of superman on tv, as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period.this series paid homage to both the superman films of the '70s/'80s and the superman comics series "reboot" of 1986-onward ("man of steel," "superman vol 2," "action comics," "adventures of superman," etc). the opening score and titles were stirring, based on the john williams score from the films, updated for a saturday morning action series. marv wolfman, one of the main contributors to the comics reboot (writer of "adventures of superman") was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series. overall, the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid-friendly.superman was presented as believable, strong, and iconic. his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his megalomaniac/ceo incarnation. the daily planet characters lois, jimmy, and perry were portrayed well. one of my favorite appearances was by wonder woman, and the story revolved around her home island of themyscira ("paradise island"). both her design and that of her mother hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted wonder woman comic book series of the era, and it seemed like an equally well-done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same.the one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on dvd/blu-ray! it deserves to be.

after the superfriends and scooby doo left the saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986, i pretty much stopped watching saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in. and since neither the real ghostbusters nor the flintstone kids seemed very promising to me, i "retired" and started sleeping in on saturday mornings. i only returned to saturday morning tv in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show. a new animated show of superman was something i was not going to pass up. i was 17 and in high school at the time, but so what! i loved this show. from what i can recall, this series was a gift to fans i suppose in celebration of superman's 50th birthday that particular year. it had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of john williams movie score from the richard donner/christopher reeve superman movies. i honestly felt that the animation style ruby spears did was reminiscent of the super powers team: galactic guardians series by hanna barbera a few years before. sadly, danny dark was not back as superman, but i felt beau weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of superman and his clark kent was nerdy like the chris reeve version. after hearing him as reed richards/mr. fantastic on the 90's fantastic four, i could still see this version of superman in my mind. ginny mcswain as lois lane. lol! what a rhyme. she was a voice director for hanna barbera and ruby spears and i guess she took it upon herself to do lois. memories of the superfriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast. jimmy olsen is mark taylor, who on the superfriends was formerly firestorm. perry white is none other than former batman tv writer stanley ralph ross, who on superfriends was gorilla grodd and brainiac in the super powers shows. and lex luthor, now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than superfriends voice alum, michael bell, whom i know best as zan and the riddler as well as many other characters on many other series. i felt this series was a combination of the movie superman along with the post crisis john byrne re envision of superman, with lex luthor as a billionaire tycoon, jonathan and martha kent being alive to see clark as superman. the bruce timm series and lois and clark would also do this. unfortunately, we never saw brainiac, bizarro, toyman, metallo, or darkseid. other than luthor, we saw only the prankster and we did see general zod. i especially enjoyed that one episode with wonder woman, who was voiced over by bj ward who played her on the super powers team as well. the episodes were smashing and i also enjoyed clark's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to metropolis in the short little segment, superman's family album. the only two things i didn't like. it only lasted one season. and after wonder woman's guest spot, i was hoping batman would turn up voiced over by adam west (still thinking about the super powers team episodes i guess). i also hoped for it because on the prankster episode, the metropolis baseball team was pitted against the gotham goliaths. every popular super hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare. for spiderman, i feel it's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as amazing friends. for the incredible hulk, it's the 1982 cartoon. for the fantastic four, it's the 1978 series with herbie the robot. for batman, it's the new adventures of batman 1977 by filmation featuring batmite. but for superman, the rarest series is this one. superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it. this is another series that wb should consider for dvd release. all in all, this 1988 version of superman is well....super!!

this early anime movie was a rather good film that i caught once on the science fiction channel when anime was actually popular here in america and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network. i quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet. this film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie, though i would rather watch the original japanese version. americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed. this film features a young boy who boards a train called the galaxy express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot. he wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun. during the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother, a beautiful woman named matel, who as with most woman in anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero, or really bad. he goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named captain harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series, so basically the galaxy express takes place in that universe. all in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending. there would be a sequel to this one, but it was not quite as good as this one, however the ending was a bit more final than it was here.

what can i say ? an action and allegorical tale which has just about everything. basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world ..... and more. he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains, and has quite a time telling them apart. a definite must-see.

anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. this is a fine movie that tells about tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grows up in the process. the journey on the train sort of represents tetsuro's journey from boyhood to manhood. the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated (you can tell it's a 70's movie) and the animation is only slightly better than your average "star blazers" episode. but the story and the characters are so strong, it really doesn't matter. a must-see for any animation fan!

one word can describe this movie and that is weird. i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting. well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.

galaxy express 999 (ginga tetsudô three-nine). made in 1979. directed by rintaro. based on the original work by leiji matsumoto.what little i know of the history of galaxy express 999, it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by leiji matsumoto. ge999 is set in the same star wars-type of space universe as matsumoto's other famous space manga: captain harlock. in fact space pirate harlock and other characters from that manga (including queen emeraldas and tochirô oyama) make appearances in ge999. ge999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes. it was aired in 1978. a year later came this anime film, which isn't a sequel to the series, but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie. the story is set in unidentified star wars-type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility. people of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years, maybe even forever. the protagonist, tetsurô hoshino, is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel count mecha, whose entire body is made of mechanical parts, kills tetsurô's mother. tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body. to obtain it he must travel to a far-away planet with space train galaxy express 999. however, since tetsurô comes from poverty, he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket. by a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman, maetel, who bears a resemblance to his dead mother. maetel offers a ticket for tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey. and so the journey beginsi first saw this film last october, about six months from now, and again yesterday. i feel that i must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film: it seems very rushed. then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series? whatever the case, the situations change with a fast speed and tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance. i feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes. however, there's no arguing that ge999 has deserved its place as an anime classic. the animation itself, very faithful to the style of matsumoto's manga, is detailed and beautiful to watch. even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become "out of date" but puts many later anime films in shame. the music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat "old" these day (it was the 70's after all). i have not heard any english dub of this film so i can only comment the japanese audio which is good. voice actors give life to their characters, most memorable ones being masako nozawa (mainly known as the voice of goku through out the entire dragon ball saga) as the excited and young tetsurô, and masako ikeda as the calm and mysterious maetel. the supporting characters are not left in shadows, but also have a life of their own, most memorable to me being waitress claire. the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours, as well as for those who try to find deeper messages. ge999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as tetsurô's journey from boyhood to manhood. the whole film is told from his point of view, so we are forced to feel what he feels. i think many people can relate to tetsurô, for despite the fantasy elements, he is a very realistic character: young, hot headed, awkward and naive. we follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not. maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end, when she reveals who and what she really is, it doesn't much answer to anything. maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man, always close but just out of reach. it's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between tetsurô and maetel that still awakes talking and questions, and fascinates after the decades. people have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends, of mother and son, or of two possible lovers (which wakes a lot of critique since maetel's age is unknown and tetsurô hasn't even reached his puberty yet). without any means to sound deep, i think the best term to describe them is "soul mates". there is no question that the two feel devotion, caring and love for each others, yet it goes beyond that of friendship, family and lovers. i think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories, it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters. the ending scene, even if you already know what is going to happen, is still very touching and memorable.all in all, despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes, galaxy express 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like katsuhiro otomo's akira (1988) and mamoru oshii's ghost in the shell (1995). the film is directed by rintaro, who had previous experience of leiji matsumoto's works as he had worked in captain harlock series. later rinatro directed a wonderful looking metropolis (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines. galaxy express 999 (1979) is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan.

yeah, it is. in fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies. number 15, i think. anyways, i'm usually not one for plots, but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games, (final fantasy 7, for example) and not movies. but this one has it all. vivid drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written screenplay. while this is not really for children, they can still watch it, it contains no graphic blood, guts and silicone. but i don't think they're going to understand it.

i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say, galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time. if you've never understood the appeal of anime, discovering this film may be your golden ticket to otaku-town.the story is as delicate and poetic as ridley scott's blade runner. the cell animation, while somewhat traditional, possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling.this is one of those unique children's films like star wars, the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends 'family entertainment' status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms.i highly recommend this film.

those childhood memories...when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.one of the initial memories i have from childhood is this animated program "galaxy express 999," about a young boy named tetsuro, who goes on a train ride around the galaxy, in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold-hearted, trophy gathering mechanical hunters. accompanying tetsuro on his journey is maetel, a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago...back in the early-80's, as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in seoul, south korea, "galaxy express 999" was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from japan, which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them. the memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9pm before bed time...those were some wonderful memories, never to be had again...as i moved to america, and while residing here for over 2 decades, i sometimes wondered about that time and place, in a country thousands of miles away divided from america by an enormously vast ocean, of this childhood program, with its hit theme song, and of the boy named tetsuro, his protective companion maetel, the enigmatic train conductor, and of the spacefaring train galaxy express 999.many, many years passed...last summer while i was in korea, i was able to track down a copy of the original "galaxy express 999" (1979) on dvd, and it brought back a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. "galaxy express 999" remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago, opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and embarked on their life's journey into manhood.here's to wonderful memories. "good-bye, maetel. good-bye, galaxy express 999...good-bye, to my childhood."10/10

attention, spoiler!many people told me that «planet of the apes» was tim burton's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film. so i decided not to see it. another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet, advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a tim-burton-movie is still a tim-burton-movie'. i decided to do it, and i found that he was right.it's clear that a remake of such a famous film as `planet of the apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. still, tim burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `beetlejuice' or `batman'. if you are already fond of burton-movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some flaws: nerve-racking monkey squeals, over-dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been, without difficulties, replaced by anbody else.what the film gives us in the first place, is an answer to the question: what's the result when tim burton is instructed to create a remake? first of all, burton wouldn't be burton, if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start; it's a `re-imagining'. on the other hand, burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston (as human), and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared. so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes. concerning the story-line, burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first, and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  and here is the spoiler  leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever. now, this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing, shocking ending of the first `planet of the apes'. an ending, even more unexpected, more astonishing and: completely confusing, because  and here i'm disagreeing with various `planet of the apes'-homepages and -platforms  it does not make any sense. there cannot be a meaning to it, or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective. tim burton is playing his cruel games, he does it with a grin and he does it well. burton fans will sure like it, others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism. well, and i don't think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake again

....after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me!!!! whatever happened to the old burton who read "the dark knight returns" by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988-89? by the looks of it burton didn't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong! this movie sucks! it's not as good as the original and it doesn't deal with the same subject as the original. if you want a good ape movie watch the original.**out of****stars

take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. it's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. visually, it's incredible. everything else was just ok. for what it is, i think the movie is awesome, but i like everything burton has done. people need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b/c of this movie. it wasn't supposed to be a remake, and it's not. the ending was cool. . i took it as a parallel universe.

charleton heston wore one, james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth. i hope no one casts him as tarzan. linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. she's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. this movie has three great actors tim roth, ms. carter & paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch. superlative make up (a certain oscar) costumes, sets, music make this the hit summer movie of 2001.

this is an excellent little movie! the acting is good and the music is fantastic!! play it on a 5-1 sound system and enjoy! it will never win any awards but its good clean fun for all!! i recommend this movie to all fans of pretty girls funny and hansom men as well as robot lovers everyone!!1 p.s. it also stars lisa rinna! enjoy!!this is a very hard movie to find, it is out of print. i first saw it on showtime many years ago but recently found a used vhs copy. its still a must see for all!!!this is an excellent little movie! the acting is good and the music is fantastic!! play it on a 5-1 sound system and enjoy! it will never win any awards but its good clean fun for all!! i recommend this movie to all fans of pretty girls funny and hansom men as well as robot lovers everyone!!1 p.s. it also stars lisa rinna! enjoy!! dave engle this is a very hard movie to find, it is out of print. i first saw it on showtime many years ago but recently found a used vhs copy. its still a must see for all!!!

okay, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but i've voted for "10" to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo's who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews. each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers... three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big-time hollywood productions. performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive, with notable turns by bill paxton, james karen, vivian schilling and brion james. martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe-lamp, and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim. but overall, it's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments. definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!

one woman, by herself in a house for 45-minutes of screen time, doesn't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat... but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come! writer / star vivian schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress, and enlarges them to terrifying proportions, so don't watch this film alone!

unlike other commentaries, i found this film fascinating, even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors.being a technologist, i found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic, experiments are being conducted now to do just this. i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage, with results so far not favorable.the characters in the movie are well cast. the girl, although overacting a bit, looks suitable dumb. the truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers. the minister conveys doubt at first, (the principal investigator tells the minister that him (the minister), is not sure whether he believes that god created man or that man created god. but the minute when the chips are down, he falls back on his faith. only the phd plays the zombie. the secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters. in the face of death they react as real human beings would.the movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by government. as strictly a thriller, the movie does not have enough thrills. as a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinnings it is fascinating.

"secret of the lens" is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine. the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki, who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. i wish he did more campiness like this.my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence, the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen, the party riots that bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, worsle appears.check this out.warning:this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans!

people don't seem to be giving lensman enough credit where its due. a few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the lensman experience.the year: for the year it was made in (1984) lensman features some of the most stunning effects i've ever seen. as a person who watches a lot of early 80's animation lensman is unique in it's use of what appears to be computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive. kim's battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this. every time i watch that i have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made.the soundtrack: lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that i've heard, and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film. lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine. while the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the thionite factory on radelyx, the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of chris. it's interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when i was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format - since there wasn't a single second of silence available to use as a reference point.western influences: helmut - sounds like "helmet" and has roughly the same voice as darth vader. clarissa fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the princess of sw and her name sounds suspiciously similar to marissa fairborn of transformers. takes over han solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise. buzzkirk - a definite improvement on chewbaka. the lens - a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach christianity at the audience than in the original sw. while the force relied on belief far more than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration tool. theoretically, anyone could wield the lens. the lens is far more limited than the force - being purely a defensive/offensive weapon.technology: the boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships. they look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white. the idea of a dna weapon was nice if only it had been developed. the galactic alliance looked like starblazers (or whatever it was called - that 60's series where they were battling the xylons). there weren't enough ship to ship battles for me - this is much improved upon in the second lensman film.finally a note on worzel. this character is a unique and very interesting character-design who fortunately continues on to the second film.

lensman is a rather lesser-known anime gem from toho and mk studios.it's loosely based on the novel,but it reminds me more of the game "metroid".if you want to see this,see it in japanese with subtitles or just plain japanese.the english dubbed version was almost cropped and edited to death.there is not much new,despite the fact that it's the 1st animated feature to combine cg-graphics with hand-drawn animation,but it's fun to watch,nevertheless.

though i like e.e. "doc" smith's books and david a. kyles books of lensman, the anime, which is loosly based on the books, is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair.though the story may seem familiar to sci-fi/fantasy buffs, such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family, it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless. plus, lensman was the first animated motion picture to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once. sure, it may look a bit outdated now, but it is still an innovation. if it were not for lensman, none of that would have ever happened (personally, i think computer graphics look better in animation that live action.)too bad they only released it on dvd/vcd in a few countries in the worls (mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different). i just wish they release the lensman movie and tv series on dvd/vcd in every part of the world, not just certain parts.p.s. worsel rules! i just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well.

the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland, winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead. michael gaffikin (james warwick) a former paratrooper in the british army, is the local dentist, he's not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson (celia imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip(maurice roëves) at the islands police station, inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp, dr goudry, for closer inspection. a quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. over dinner that night with michael gaffikin, fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one colonel howard (jonathan newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength, one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer, another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain. with a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn't work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. reports of ufo's and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin's idea that aliens might be involved, but a rise in radioactive levels on the island, has him doubting himself.the nightmare man is based on the novel, child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire, it is here adapted by dr who and blake's 7 scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci/fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. the nightmare man though is on the whole, a succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down to the minor characters, time is given to giving them all a firm background. the island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over, but its one that i enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama, but credit to camfield, he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. there is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point. if there is one negative about the killer its that, we are given his/her/its pov for the killings, an acceptable cliché on its own, but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens, it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer, given the clues presented, but it's a fun and very well acted piece. the local scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. imrie, never one i've taken to in other works, is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production. the outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, it disappointed me in some ways, but taking into account when it was made, its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it, is even more terrifying.

the next-to-last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting, sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season; though flawed, 'all our yesterdays' has its moments and overall a moody, compelling feel to it. kirk, spock, and mccoy beam down to a planet, assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there, since the planet's sun is due to explode within hours. but as it turns out, the people there are all too aware of the planet's fate, and using a kind of time travel device, have escaped into the past. each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a 'library,' run by an elderly man named mr. atoz. atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well, and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers. there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode, with lines like:mccoy- where did they go? atoz- wherever they wanted to.the misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily, but for plot purposes, it isn't, and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th century england, while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age, 5000 years in the planet's past. from here, the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment. spock begins acting increasingly emotional, showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for zarabeth, the woman. he eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on vulcan, 5000 years ago. kirk makes his way back to the library first, and finally convinces mr. atoz they don't belong in his planet's history. spock and mccoy return just before it's too late, leaving zarabeth behind; the enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes, destroying the planet. the interaction between spock and zarabeth provides this episode's most memorable moments, though kirk's adventure into the 'english' past is amusing. all in all, a very decent latter-day star trek outing.

there's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. from the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. kirk, spock and mccoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.the librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england, while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. the intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by mariette hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age, and ian wolfe as the urbane librarian. somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode city on the edge of forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. this has to be one of the best of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.

this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek. there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool. first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode. they meet a freaky librarian type dude (very well played). then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth. mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy.spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves. you can literally taste the sadness at the end. leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching. spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human. albeit, in a not so nice neighborhood!anyway, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode....a love story, the salem witch trials, spock as a human, the desperation of being left in total isolation...abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film. this one is a classic, don't miss it....i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans!!!!!!

dr. mccoy and mr. spock find themselves trapped in a planet's past ice age, while capt. kirk is in the same planet's colonial period. however, it's the former pair that has the most trying time. besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary to be found only in caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy zarabeth (mariette hartley). as spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction to zarabeth and throwing "caution to the wind" about ever leaving this place. only with dr. mccoy's constant "reminders" does spock hold on to some grasp of reality.this stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some "emotion" and nimoy (spock) plays it to the hilt, coming close to knocking the bejesus out of deforest kelly (mccoy). surprising to previous installment, captain kirk (william shatner) wasn't allowed to get the girl, another plus for this one.perennial "old man" ian wolfe assays the role of "mr. atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past.

kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. they intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr. atoz who operates some sort of high-tech library. despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly 'make a selection while there is still time'. they have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror-like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past. then, while a disk is in the viewer, kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis xiv (the 1660s). when mccoy and spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository.while kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, spock and mccoy's is much more eventful, as spock falls head over heels for mariette hartley--who was sent to this awful place as a punishment. the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy.spock's departure from the norm, the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode--one well worth seeing.fyi--ian wolfe, the excellent character actor, played mr. atoz. i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969. interestingly enough, despite looking ancient, he lived on another 23 years--dying at over 95 years of age!!

the penultimate episode of star trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season. essentially, spock, mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr. atoz, the librarian. all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidon's past. spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the 'city on the edge of forever'--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidon's present. in the end, all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova. the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes.ironically, as william shatner notes in his book "star trek memories," this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisette's script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way. nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer, fred freiberger, that vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love. (p.272) however, freiberger reasoned, the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state. this was a great example of improvisation on freiberger's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode. while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in "plato's stepchildren," play music with hippies in "the way to eden" or sometimes display emotion, the script here was more believable. spock's acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner. (p.272) the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time, mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state, not just spock. but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows, the brilliant spock/mccoy performance and the originality of this script. who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past? this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'classic trek'--a genuinely inspired story. shatner, in 'memories', named some of his best "unusual and high quality shows" of season 3 as the enterprise incident, day of the dove, is there in truth no beauty, the tholian web, and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome. (p.273) while my personal opinion is that 'and the children shall lead' is a very poor episode while 'is there in truth no beauty' is problematic, "all our yesterdays" certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films. i give a 9 out of 10 for 'all our yesterdays.'

an unusual take on time travel: instead of traveling to earth's past, the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet. they beam down to this planet, whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours (that's cutting it close!). in some kind of futuristic library, they meet mr. atoz (a to z, get it? ha-ha) and his duplicates. it turns out, instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel, the usual way, the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras. mr. atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection (check out the discs we see here, another trek prognostication of cds and dvds!). when mr. atoz prepares the machine (the atavachron-what-sis), gallant kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of earth's 17th century, where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery. there's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time, using phrasing of the time ("...you're a bully fine coo.. witch! witch! they'll burn ye...!"). spock & mccoy follow kirk, but end up in an ice age, 5000 years earlier.kirk manages to get back to the library first. the real story here is spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors, the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago. this doesn't really make sense, except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change (even so, spock & mccoy weren't 'prepared' by atoz - oh, well; it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away, instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical vulcan). in any case, spock really shows his nasty side here - forget "day of the dove" and remember "this side of paradise" - mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged. spock also gets it on with zarabeth, a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment (a couple of trek novels were written about spock's son, the result of this union). all these scenes are eye-openers, a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in. it's also ironic that, only a few episodes earlier ("requiem for methuselah"), mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens. kirk, meanwhile, tussles with the elderly atoz, who insists that kirk head back to some past era ("you are evidently a suicidal maniac" - great stuff from actor wolfe, last seen in "bread and circuses"). it all works out in the end, but, like i mentioned earlier, they cut it very close. a neat little trek adventure, with a definite cosmic slant.

ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for "jean de florrette". hello! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form. i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point. this film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called "american humour" which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap. the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off.thankyou

i think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best 'national lampoon's' films, it also has a very catchy spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about.... men in white!!!! the story is a spoof of many films including a will smith film, as you might have guessed, 'men in black'. i will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny (leslie nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (garbage cans). also, they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry (garbage collecting truck) in that scene too. the acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, but that is what makes the film funny, it is a comedy, loosen up!! i love the story line, partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (or should it be un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. i am great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also a fan of the real thing, and with this films, it is hard to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film carries it off successfully. the two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a tv sketch show in the uk called 'little britain'. this film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, national lampoon's film to date!!

what is with all of the european (especially england) comments here? all i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great. of course it's stupid. that's the point. you have to see the movie dr. strangelove and men in black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come on people, what did you expect to see? i can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and they were expensive hollwood films with real actors in them. for what it's worth, men in white is a very stupid-funny mock of a movie. and with all the stupid-funny stuff that england has been making for the last half century, i am shocked at all the negative comments. us stupid americans like our stupid humor. p.s., see 'team america: world police" for some true laughs that europeans will especially like. ha!

the "men in white" movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not the funniest, comedy movies i ever watched! (and i watched quite a lot!) it is about two garbagemen, who become "men in white" and then stop an invasion from space. it is also a parody of lots of classic movies, such as "men in black", "star wars" or "dr. strangelove". anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head. there are tons of funny gags and jokes here, and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard (it happened to me!). if you can watch this movie on tv, watch it now - you certainly won't regret it!

i found this movie hilarious. the spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest i have seen in this sort of movie. give it a try. if you saw the movies that this movie is spoofing, and you get the humor, you should enjoy the movie.i (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part in the movie (this is not a spoiler because i will not tell you what actually happens) was a scene with the "flashy thingy" from mib. when they first discover the device and do not know what it is does... and then again later in the movie... you'll understand when you get there.my only complaint about the movie is that i have never been able to find it in dvd so that i could buy a copy.

this movie has recieved horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like dude wheres my car and dumb and dumber this movie is for you. if your into movies like citizen kane and casablanca id have to sugest you in a different angle. yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of "kiddy" this is one of the few movies me and my freinds have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible. great movie. this movie should the afis number 1 because its so friggin' high class. the only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists. so i dont know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere. i still have it taped from when it was first on, you can come over if you want and watch it bute i might be sleeping. this movie rocks and thats basicly all you need to know.

actually i liked this movie very, very much. not because of it`s plot, acting, jokes, no. i liked it, because it`s one of the worse movies ever created. it`s so lame, so bad, that it becomes terribly funny. some jokes are actually cool, but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter. "men in white" are so dumb and stupid, that you can do only two things. turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot:). i chose the second option.

another excellent arnold movie. this futuristic movie has great action in it, and is one of arnie's best movies. arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death. this movie is excellent and a great sci-fi / action movie. i've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! perfection

the running man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks.in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary, post 1980s-boom. forget that though! there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film.schwarzenegger is on top form as ben "the butcher of bakersfield" richards, and the inclusion of bond-belting one liners was completely inspired-thety are truly leg-end-dary (with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight).the design of the stalkers is authentically american, and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc 'gladiators' tv show, and the wwe as well. buzz-saw's grisly end will chill any viewer to the core (as a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour?)jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle (and are arnies buds in real life), and its even got mick fleetwood in it too! what more could you ask for?i highly recommend the running man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action, with a glossty finish and some great characters. just don't expect an education from it (at least on surface value).quality, i bloody love it actually. you will too unless you're a thesp. 7/10

i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn't know about this website and i didn't realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show. for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can't tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt. the episode where starsky (kill starsky) almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show. what to you expect of a kid at age 12. now, i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i'm so there!!!!!!!! just got to say happy birthday paul!!!!!

although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my dvd rack and i don't know why. i think i like it because the moral of the story is 'television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life'. for those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book, its nothing like the film at all. to ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building, killing himself, everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time. i read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9/11.

this is an arnold movie. now that you know that, i've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review. if you don't like arnold, then you wont like this movie. if the case is the other, then you will very probably like it. it's as simple as that.now, if you're still reading this i expect you like arnold. good for you! he is quite good isn't he. the running man is a very typical arnold feature. it's got the usual retro-future we know so well from 80's b-sci fi, it's got a bunch of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending.in this case, the evil opponent is the all-controlling 1984ish government, which uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows. arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down, with a little help from his two confederates and the good-looking amber.it's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it. it's hopelessly 80's, but i find that charming. acting is varying, arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing, with a helping of stone-faced one-liners. heroine amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named damen killian is a typical evil tv man.in spite of all it's flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. it also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience. this does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming.if you've seen arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one. enjoy.

set in 2017 (although one might easily mistake it for 1987, judging by the hairstyles and clothing), the running man sees all-round good guy ben richards (schwarzeneggar) framed for a crime he didn't commit. after a daring prison break, he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal tv game show the running man, along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female, amber (maria conchita alonso),.used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses, the show pits convicts against a range of colourful (and often quite camp) opponents, each having his own unique killing style: dynamo fires electricity from a special suit, buzzsaw uses chainsaws, sub zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick, and fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders. but these killers are no match for ben richards, who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner (followed by the obligatory witticism).towards the end of the movie, ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host, killian.twenty years ago, arnold schwarzeneggar ruled the action-movie universe and, to his legion of fans, he could do no wrong. the austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies: comic book violence plus logic-free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one-liners, minus acting ability equalled massive profits. the running man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a t and arnie's (mostly male teenage) audience lapped it up (myself included).now, two decades later, and having just finished re-watching the movie for the first time in years, i find it a strange movie: one totally devoid of technical merit, decent acting, and convincing effects, yet somehow totally entertaining. directed by paul michael glaser (best known as det. dave starsky from cult 70s cop show, starsky and hutch), and adapted from a short story by stephen king (writing under the nom de plume, richard bachman), the running man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated, yet despite (or maybe because of) the film's shoddiness, it has a special charm which is hard to describe.with no attempt at creating a realistic near-future setting, the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles. check out the scene in which ben discovers amber's secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes(!); marvel at the crap 'futuristic' graphics used on advertising billboards and the running man board game (as a graphic designer, i found these particularly amusing); be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements.the running man may be utter rubbish, but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that i have no hesitation in recommending to fans of arnie and sci-fi action in general.

why didn't dynamo have any pants?! where did they go?? it was never explained. that's why this movie was so awesome. plus starsky gave his kids the aids!!!! great acting too. richard dawson deserved to win best supporting actor! a i d s my favorite line from the movie was "that hit the spot" a i d s. this movie was for the "birds". i tried to give this movie the "stinkeye" but it continued playing. what am i doing wrong???!!!! i thought the "hateboat" was funnnny lol ;) i would like that for a show. why wasn't dynamo wearing pants. i know his arm was skewered but... what's up with those crazy futur nets. why didn't that family feud guy ray combs get a net?? he could have used one. aidsssss

running man viciously lampoons the modern-day american media complex, and hits its target dead-center. it may be an easy target, but they pull it off none the less. rm effortless takes on pro-wrestling (featuring some pro wrestlers as the hunters), network television, the nielsen ratings, the american government (suggesting it's entertainment-oriented anyway), crime & punishment, and a half-dozen other things along the way. it's a far cry from the original stephen king novella, and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either. but who cares? it's basically a arnie flick, with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-liners such an undertaking requires.

running man isn't a great movie, in fact it's kinda silly. but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment. i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture, it's so silly and over the top, that it almost makes fun of itself. by the way, this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there.

this comic book style film is funny, has nicely paced action and a great futuristic style to it. writer steven de souza, who also wrote commando, gives arnie plenty of lines to dish out: "send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a pen into the lawyers back; "what a pain in the neck," after strangling subzero with barbed wire; "he had to split," after slicing his body between his legs; and finally, as killian slams through a billboard bearing his own face, arnie concludes, "now that hit the spot." funnily enough, bears some similarities total recall, another sci-fi flick starring schwarzenegger.

this is one of the great movies of the 80s in my collection that i think about all the time. the running man is one of arnold`s best and most different films even to this day and when i first saw the running man i was so excited to see a movie like this. i just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie. it also has jesse ventura, the legendary professor toru tanaka, sven-ole thorsen, the beautiful maria conchita alonso, yaphet kotto, kurt fuller, richard dawson, and thomas rosales jr. who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as universal solder, the lost world, robo cop 2, predator 2, and among others. all arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed, star filled, and its one its one of arnold`s best to date!

didn't mystic pizza win the oscar for that year? this movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why i felt that way upon leaving the theater. only "wargames" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling i was getting a glimpse of our future. history has shown that this is exactly what happened.the casting is a pop-culture cuisinart of the 1980s: you get arnold as ben richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to "run" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; richard dawson as damon killian, treating his role as if he were the host of family feud with the contestants using real guns; jesse ventura as "captain freedom" and co-wrestler professor tanaka as "subzero," both "stalkers" who kill the "running men." even mick fleetwood (mic) and dweezil zappa (stevie) show up, while the "dancers of the future" are none other than the laker girls. this movie screams "80s." the plot is a good excuse for the action: ben richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the running man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as "contestants." maria conchita alonzo as amber mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge salma hayek in the 1990s.the production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. i remember thinking when i was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? if the running man were listed in tv guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. the government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down american public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for "national security" is downright chilling. ben richards is played brilliantly by arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of america is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.the movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with back to the future iii, the "ravine" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. it is tragic that, as with wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. "serious" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their "common man" counterparts, such as this one.an absolute must-see.

amongst the standard one liner type action films, where acting and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. if the person in charge of casting were to have put "good" actors in this flick, it would have been worse(excepting richard dawson who actually did act well, if you can call playing yourself "acting"). i love this movie! the running man is in all likelihood god's gift to man(okay maybe just men). definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line: "it's all part of life's rich pattern brenda, and you better f*****g get used to it." ahh, more people have been called "brenda" for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine.

if you were brought up on a diet of gameshows you'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix. well, in the world of the running man, your needs will be sated. for in this game show, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate prize - their very lives.i loved this film. it was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis. it isn't one of schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it is a very good film. the underlying idea that television corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very believable, and is very well portrayed in this film. of course there are the usual arnie one-liners, my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the gameshow host asks "any last words?" arnie says: "yeah, i'll be back" but the host quips "only in a re-run" and presses the eject button. i give this film a 10 for sheer originality. i must have watched it 30 or more times. the only film apart from the die hard series that i watched this often!!in short, do not for a minute think that you own the t.v. - it owns you.....

the running man, along with total recall, is my favorite schwarzenegger movie. no, this isn't 2001, but it's not meant to be. and the acting and script here isn't even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator. but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. a state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are equipped with none) in order to satisfy the public's lust for sport and blood. the ultimate prize for a winning runner: freedom. or so the rules claim.for a movie with such over-the-top gory death scenes and cheesy one-liners, it really does have a lot to say. someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culture/government presented in this movie, so i won't go into it here. suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie, you will enjoy it very much (especially if you're a big sf fan with a lot of imagination). like i said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shoot-em-up flick. the premise is borrowed from a richard bachman (aka stephen king) short novel, but diverges fairly strongly from its source material, especially towards the end. (the book ends rather nihilistically; needless to say this movie doesn't.) i enjoyed both, but i like the movie better.my favorite line: "guess it's caused from steroids."

this is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring arnold schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including the television networks. one of their most popular tv shows is "the running man", where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. it's set up like a game show, where the audience votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky "contestants". audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. and the host is played by none other than family feud's richard dawson, who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. when ben richards (arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game.this movie is chock full of classic arnold one-liners, such as his famous "i'll be back" right before he enters the arena. and he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "how about a light?" i could go on and on, but i don't want to spoil the movie. it's funny stuff!whether it was intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "reality tv" craze. already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are televised for their "entertainment value". running man demonstrates what would happen if reality tv hit rock bottom, and it is a scary picture. one can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far.overall, this is a fun film & i highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!

arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives. but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play! the movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen, controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state. it's most popular game show is the running man, in which criminals are forced to survive against "stalkers" that live to kill them.the movie opens with ben richards (arnold) leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress. he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them, refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison, in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help. the government blames richards for the massacre earning him the name "butcher of bakersfield". eighteen months later richards along with two friends william laughlin (koto) and harold weiss (mcintyre) breakout of a detention zone they worked in. they make their way to the underground, led by mic (mick fleetwood). mic quickly identifies richards as the "butcher of bakersfield" and refuses to help him, but his friend's convince him otherwise. they want him to join the resistance, but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job. soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name amber mendez (alonso) has taken his apartment. knowing who he is she won't help him, but he convinces her, but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out.meantime, the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill. damon killian (dawson) the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture. richards refuses to play, killian threatens to use his friends instead of him, so he signs the contract. you'll love that part. but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure killian knows he'll be back. the runners begin to make there way through the zones and fight characters that are memorable, sub-zero, buzz saw and many others. eventually richards is joined by amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too. together they find the underground and make there way back to killian and give him a farewell send off.the running man is another one of arnold's great movies from the 80's. the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen king's book of the same name. some have said that the book is better. i'm sure it's not and i don't care anyway i loved the movie. as in all of arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even ventura gets a couple in. but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film. being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded. the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you. keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows, "hate boat" among others. also the cast was great besides arnold, koto, and alonzo don't forget professor toru tanaka, jim brown, ventura and sven-ole! with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now, but i'm sure the hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the "evil bush". the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one. some how the aclu managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things. blasphemy! overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him ,you can't miss this. its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day. the futuristic world and humor are great. overall 10 out 10 stars, definitely one of his best.

the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger films.but, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality tv. it is quite different to the stephen king book, true, but i doubt whether hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form.but, on with the review.ben richards (arnold schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. the economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like jumping for dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is the running man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian (played by the entertaining richard dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.some, however, try and speak up against the government. when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield, california, a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. when richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. he is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (yaphet kotto) and goes on the run.however, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez (marita conchita alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on the running man.and there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode. richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of los angeles (why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. amber also becomes curious about richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed. guess what happens to her, then? so, as amber, richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop. he's super arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accent.yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's arnie fun. there's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('he had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. it's a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.if you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed. but if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it. but the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.if you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv. it's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv. we've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. it seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.with that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...

i'm sitting here nov 2006 and i still can't help rave about this movie. arnold's best movies came in about a 4-5 year span. running man, predator, and total recall (1990). all 3 are amazing. the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall. they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017, but you can't help but snicker at the 80's style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv's. also the computer graphics of the "the running man" game show intro would not look like that in 2017. nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic. not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today's movie's. i really think that arnold's acting is much better than he's given credit for. now i would not have elected him governor but that's california for you. buzzsaw, dynamo, fireball, subzero are fantastic "stalkers" as well and i find the producers don't try to overkill the fight scenes. when the stalker is dead...he's dead. it doesn't go on for 20 minutes each. the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don't try and overplay it. i give this movie a 10/10 and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy a lot of movies these days. if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary.

this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time. when watching this movie , your filled with action, and when somethings not really happing , the humour is un matched. brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix , of a game show where criminals are the contestants, and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood.also arnold doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners.i don't want to spoil anything for you ,but i will tell you when arnold gives his "i'll be back line" he gets the best response of them all in this movie. hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did.

this is an awesome action film with great one liners from arnie!. it's stylishly made, with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied. the characters were awesome, and richard dawson, is very menacing as the main villain. yes it has tons of plot holes,however it's highly highly entertaining, with a great ending as well. it had a great story, too it, and arnie and maria conchita alonso had great chemistry together. the character development was also pretty good, with, some superb performances. the directing is great!. paul michael glaser, does a very good job here, with awesome use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, awesome camera angles, and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. there is a little bit of gore. we get a few bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, slit throat, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood, and an impaling. the acting is great!. arnold schwarzenegger is amazing as always, he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners, kicks that ass, and as always is a big physical presence!, and was tons of fun to watch! (arnie rules!). maria conchita alonso, does well here, she was really cute, and had good chemistry with arnie!. yaphet kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. marvin j. mcintyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!. richard dawson is awesome as the main villain, and was very very menacing, and he was fun to watch. jesse ventura,jim brown,erland van lidth,gus rethwisch,and professor toru tanaka, all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers. overall a must see! ****1/2 out of 5

mild spoilersin the near future, arnold stars as ben richards, a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'the running man', a deadly tv game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the 'stalkers'. of course, people are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold to prove the system wrong.i haven't read the stephen king book, but this is a great film regardless, one of arnold's best. he does what he does best in the action man role, delivering death with unforgettable one-liners. classics are probably the 'he was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a guy with barb wire, and 'he had to split!', referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically. dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter, and all the 'stalkers' are suitably camp. the action is violent, but its an action film. that's the point. the film is fast paced, and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. with starsky and hutch's paul michael glaser at the helm, and made in the wake of the success of the terminator, previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold, and very far fetched. but today, anyone who watches a lot of tv could see how the film is getting closer to reality. i wouldn't be surprised if i turn on the tv in the 'near future' and see a show not to far from this.on that depressing note, i must however recommend 'the running man' to anyone who likes the 80s, arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film. 9. 5 / 10

of all arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man. a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad. it may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. not when you think about it. currently, reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. if the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man? how long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the justice department? there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows.the biggest message of all is 'you are being lied to'. it's no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots. and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. it's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future. it's no secret that reality tv is not very realistic. it's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. usually it's far from the real truth.although rather different than stephen king's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical arnie formula. yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'i'll be back' (which he never really said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been (these two were considered before arnie believe it or not).the director is none other than dave starsky himself (paul michael glaser). it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. andrew davis (not a director i particularly like) was attached before glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.first of all, harold faltermeyer's score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release. gone is the horrid letterbox picture. in its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. the new dolby 5.1 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing. there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. definitely one of the best re-masters i've seen so far. two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'meet the stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.

i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago. then, the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional, if indeed they could ever transpire at all. not any longer. now, the politics, society, and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed.consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year the running man came out) that are present today:concern with, as richard dawson's character damon killian puts it, "traditional morality." checkentertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort on the part of contestants. checkcameras everywhere. checkrestricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports ("travel passes" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. checkan increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media. checkcomputer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage (such as the "digital matting" of ben richards' image onto the stunt double). checkjailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. checkflagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy; increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent. check, check, checkthen again, maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king novella. but just to be safe, i'm moving to switzerland.

this was stupid funny movie.. cheech and chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever... i rate this film a 7.. but if you like this one then go see jay and silentbob! there funnier and crazier. now cheech is a sellout working on kids movies..... wheres chong?

spoilersa buddy of mine said next movie was the best cheech & chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and the blues brothers. next movie has no plot, has no pacing, really has no anything of what defines a movie ... but it is funny. and for what it is worth, cheech and chong show some heart.well, in this little paragraph i put in the plot, but being that four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would usually start a story. i will just say that cheech 's cousin shows up.was there no other funnier moment when chong made cheech drink the pee twice? what about the rooster? was that pee-wee herman's first movie appearance? you would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. i don't think next movie has strong enough balls to make it awesome, but the movie has heart and hey, my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 7.

ok, needless to say, this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people.that being said, if you are one of these aformentioned people, this film is a must. in fact, i think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong. what monty python's holy grail is to geeks and nerds, so is this movie to potheads. i first saw this film 10 years ago or so, and i still crack up every time i watch it. the jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle, far better than latter day knockoffs like half-baked attempt to.there isn't a plot, so to speak; the film is more of a collection of various skits; as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary haze. despite this, the film has an excellent sense of pace, and doesn't drag at all. many people cite up in smoke as c&c's best work, but i would have to say that next movie is superior.so if you're in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs, light up, tune in, and let your mind float away =)oh, and free tommy chong!

this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech & chong flicks. it's the first one i saw with these guys. i found it to be really good. my dad actually recommended me to get it. what a great role model, and my grandma actually bought it for me, knowing what it was like. what a family i have. well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic. i must warn you though, this isn't gut-busting funny. it has its moments but not as funny as there's something about mary. check it out anyway. i'm sure you'll laugh. unless your an anti-drug activist or something.

the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission, as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot, filled with gas. "don't spill it man !", hilarious stuff. and then, as 'the plot' ensues, you're in for one heck of a ride. i watched this film recently and it holds up, being just as funny upon each viewing. check it out.

the best cheech & chong movie so far!! of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far. i think i've seen them all about twelve times at least, and i love them all. but this is most definitely the best. compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs. part of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. i hope that one day they can make another one, because they still are great comedians. i heard they are writing a new script so who knows... i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre. i wonder if john ashcroft ever watched one of them...

i'm a fan of c&c, going back to their records, and liked this movie, but at one point in the mid-1980's on cable television in san jose california, it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie. all references to marijuana were replaced with "diamonds". the bag that "red" drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana, but the conversation still remains the same ("...it's worth ~$3000/lb"). there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing c&c, and talking to each other about getting the diamonds. at the end, instead of "space coke", it's something else. i'm not sure who created this version, but it was horrible, and obvious that they were attempting to make it family/child friendly. it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all.

this movie is fun to watch , doesnt have much of a plot (well, there isn't a plot), but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at. the basic storyline is cheech is trying to have a nice date, while chong is partying with cheech's cousin (they smoke dope , go in a music store, a massage parlor, a comedy club, and even go into someones house they don't even know! rated r

and i'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill-advised. everything concerning drugs is cut out and covered up!!! how do they do it, you might ask? well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure. anyway, instead of the marijuana which cheech and chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever!

a typical romp through cheech and chong's reality which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, pee wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and space coke !!. it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny, without becoming as strange as nice dreams. there are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work. also funny is cheech's song (mexican-americans) and chong's follow up song. another notable scene is the welfare office scene with jones (human noise machine), from the police academy series, and the old laughing man. all in all, this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not.-celluloid rehab

cheech & chong's next movie (1980) was the second film to star to pot loving duo of cheech marin and tommy chong. the lovable burn out smokers are now roommates. they live in a condemned building looking for ways to score more smoke and just lay about all day. but cheech is the "responsible" one. he has a job and a steady girlfriend. one day, cheech wants to get his freak on so he tries to get chong out of the house. another problem arises as well, cheech's brother "red" (cheech is another role) is in town and wants to hang with him. firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone, cheech pawns chong off and red. what kind of adventures will chong and red get into? will cheech get his freak on? how long will chong go without some smoke? just watch cheech & chong's next movie to find out!!tommy chong takes over the directorial reigns for the sequel. he received some experience when he did some uncredited work on up in smoke. funny but not as good as the first film. but cheech and chong fans will enjoy it. followed by nice dreams.recommended.

the invaders is a fast moving sci-fi thriller starring ben cross and sean young. ben plays renn, a traveller from another galaxy trying to find annie (played by sean) who is physically ideal to have his child. this child, if allowed to be born and returned to his planet, may be the only chance for his race to survive. the enemy, an alien who has destroyed renn's people, has also followed renn across the stars to stop this birth. cross again shows great range from comical beginnings as the alien enters a local bar and orders his first earthling cocktail, to his race with the enemy and the drama of whether he can keep annie and the child she is carrying alive.

nick and kelly are ready to be married but travis (kelly's dog) leads nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for kelly. richard burgi and susan walters play nick and kelly and make a good couple. nick loves to drink, smoke, and play pool with the fellas for fun but nick suddenly abstains from this type of fun. sex is the one thing that he loves because he wants a child. we find out that an alien race is dying and needs to interbreed with women from earth to save their population. it becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved. a fine film.

this picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of alien invaders taking over a town and many of its' men folk.the town and the players are all decked out in sort of 1950's style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it. some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature.all the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd rate to add to the amusement.these type of films often deserve a cult following:8/10.

i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out.since i had already seen the original, when i saw this on sci fi channel- i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi - i knew what it was within the first few minutes. since i like richard burgi as a character actor, i wanted to see how he would pull it off.the writers/producers etc, modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the "aliens" (they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help) using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90's. maybe it added a bit of polish to the film, or not.this film. film? this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place, although no resolution of the alien's problem.i sort of remember that in this remake, the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi/alien- i think it could have ended better. but the ending is just the ending, and the yarn is a swell yarn, being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock. many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film.this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something. i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi, this one came off well. i actually enjoyed this quite a bit.but if anyone really wants to see this story told well, i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott, directed by gene fowler jr.

not only is this film entertaining, with excellent comedic acting, but also interesting politically. it was made at the end of the soviet union, but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through. the story is set during the early days of the soviet union, and it questions the rationale behind the revolution both in cultural and practical terms. of course, by the late 80s and early 90s, the bizarre strictures of soviet society are already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some well-deserved deconstruction. happily, all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining package!jur

having first watched the movie at 14, i remember being struck by hearing the word 'govno' (sh*t) for the first time ever on the then-still-soviet tv (i bet it really was *the* first time in history  anyone wants to add this to trivia section?:)... what an open boldness and freedom, i thought! as years passed, i was more and more impressed with the movie and the incredible acting, but my feelings turned to a kind of mixture of enjoyment from a genuine piece of cinematographic art and a bitter realization of a concept diametrically opposite to my 14-y.o. impression: helplessness. there's an air of inevitable catastrophe looming throughout the movie, of primitive degenerate tide (embodied by sharikov) sweeping the lives of the finest minds advancing humanity in their areas... it's a great metaphor of russian revolution in general, inspired by intellectuals ashamed of their superiority and hoping to 'upgrade' the lower classes, only to unleash the power of mediocrity and get swallowed by it... an extremely fine and talented piece, wrapping a truly sad idea in a brilliantly satiric and elegant form. symbolically enough, the movie itself marked the end of the soviet movie traditions era before the hollywood tsunami had knocked them over  for good, it seems, judging by most current russian movies (most of them labeled 'blockbusters' in prerelease!!! trailers and posters:).funnily, that 'govno' episode is in no contradiction to efenstor's comment above re rude language of current generation... from what i've already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this, but it was not. a mild word by current standards, it was way too rude back then, and just rude enough to show the true nature of all sharikovs... btw, re efenstor's lament, it is sooo naive to juxtapose being intellectual and using rude lexicon, especially for russian speakers, where a single cussword could have meanings that take sentences in translation! but i join in regret that all the meaning in today's teenager's talk may be expressed by cusswords. i feel that this is the bigger problem than their choice of the medium that's most efficient for the task:) well, this movie and the book are great food for thought that might change them, or anyone who might have a luxury of watching it.

one of the most excellent movies ever produced in russia and certainly the best one made during the decline of the ussr. incredibly clever, hilarious and dramatic at the same time. superb acting. overall a masterpiece. score it 10/10. 

it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance. i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing. if you loved bulgakov's book you would be, understandably, afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen. there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita. as complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves out nothing. it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakov's work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score--with not a note missed. why can't we find such talent here in the u.s. ? so now my favorite book and movie have the same title.

the cult movie for every true russian intellectual. everything is brilliant, especially acting: it's beyond any praise. the movie, as the book, is full of symbols: my favorite one is the brightest symbol of razrukha (colloquial russian word for "devastation", often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 civil war) -- the wide-opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch-black hole of the doorway behind it.now the film is released on dvd with fully restored image and the 5.1 sound, there are well-translated english subtitles too, though some obscene words of sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation. i don't know is that dvd available abroad but if you'll find it grab it immediately, it's really worthy of watching.and, in conclusion, a fact: about the 50% of russians today, mostly youth, can be identified as sharikovs in a considerable degree. it's the post-soviet effect: soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the western civilization, tv-producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every russian. even among the internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it's amazingly common in colloquial speech.

this movie (and yes, it's a movie - it was shot as a two-parter, but the two parts together come down to slightly more than 2 hours) is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema. a very well-mannered, and yet at the same time absolutely savage denunciation of the soviet regime and the type of person who flourished under it, the film is a faithful adaptation of the long-banned eponymous book by mikhail bulgakov. the sets are flawless, and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia, adding a feel of authenticity where a late-80s washed-out color incarnation would have all but ruined the film. i won't say much about the plot, which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself, but the performances are true oscar material; special mentions go out to e. evstigneev, who plays the old professor with such presence, gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture, he ends up stealing every scene he's in. the second, of course, is creature/sharikov, who, played to horrifying perfection by v. tolokonnikov, is by far more frightening a character than hannibal lecter, because not only does he exist in real life - entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history, with all that ensues.while it's a socio political allegory, it is worth mentioning that the movie is also brimming with humor, albeit dark - there are many outright comedies which haven't made me laugh as much as this film. what's more, when laughing at this movie, the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement, which is always a plus.there is hardly a complaint i have with this movie - the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectual/bourgeois snobbery i caught at times from the "enlightened" characters. but that's a minor quibble.sadly, this film appears to have been bypassed by western licensing companies. it's a crying shame that one of the all-round best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated (which shouldn't be incredibly hard - though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation, the film's main themes should be accessible to all). while we're waiting with our fingers crossed for the criterion edition, i'm considering creating english subtitles myself. will see how that works out.

granted i had seen some "speed racer", but i never really watched it and i had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five. this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it. it actually ended, the bad guys done in unlike nearly every american cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformers that ended with galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the autobots, dungeons and dragons with the kids never making it home, with gi joe with cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth. this one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. as it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one android 16 used against cell in dragonball z, then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out. then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. he would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called bobo in america. the villains not only consisted of dr. hell, but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head. interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion.

i was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series (heidi, barbapapa, il etait une fois l'homme..., most of which i love). i find that other similar japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match mazinger z, as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern.that very thing, the novelty, may be one of the best features of mazinger z. another good point is its inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and bizarre characters; actually, we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us!

after viewing several episodes of this series, i have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still they can only -almost - make it work.the dialog is good! the male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions. most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side-kick. and most of the episode plots come across as palatable. so what could be wrong? how about the, the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them. the producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series, in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader. why, i ask, why?the episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen. these actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles, and you don't actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments. a blind person could tell. just listen to them talk. they deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom. who would believe these women are phd scientist, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors?in a nut shell, if the producers have their choice of a stockard channing or a morgan fairchild, guess who they'll choose - every time? and of course, the series suffers for it. too bad!

i loved this show from it's first airing, and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week. the plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding! then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining, well written show. i say bring it back, i know all of the actors would come back. i would suggest buying the dvd's, i am. i hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. i only watch one show on that channel now, (ghost hunters), but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too.

intelligent, wry, and thrilling, "the invisible man" stood out in 2000 among sci-fi's usual lineup, balancing out "farscape"'s fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty, cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. the show sat between "law and order" and "doctor who" on the believability meter, but there was no denying the fact that "i-man"'s characters went beyond caricature. even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper, the official, and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. paul ben-victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly, made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. the show's low points are still entertaining, and i've never seen such taut pilot episodes. matt greenberg and sci-fi should be commended, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show. every time i come across a marathon of "hercules: the legendary journeys" on sci-fi, i roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that "invisible man" and its ilk represented.

the invisible man is a show everybody s gotta love! it reminds me of the old school 80's series(a-team,airwolf,knightrider) the special effects are small but very effective!! but what is most important is the fun they had shooting this series. it really shows! the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want!! especially paul ben victor and vincent ventresca. ventresca really shines in this one! for me its unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style doesn't get a shot in a big movie (mr tarantino this was the show you should have directed! instead of that major boring grave danger(c.s.i)) get this show if you can. well worth it!!!

i'm going to keep this review short and sweet....i saw the trailer for this and thought i'd give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were "what the hell is this?" but after 10 minutes i was hooked and after 20 i was picking my jaw up from off the floor. this film is a great example of how different a movie can be, and furthermore it's french. this film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package, the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didn't do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and i found myself wishing every film was made like this. i think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters (just watch any hong kong legends film in english to see a perfect example)i gave it 9 although i gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels....

this film is absolutely stunning. a new blade runner - future noir at it's most gritty. the vision of paris is superb, both recognisable and visionary, with sweeping vistas, grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality.the story line is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what i like most about the film. it is a visual treat. done in 3d and rendered in black and white (no greys!) with only one short spot of colour, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. there are many "arty" camera shots - closeups and odd viewpoints - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form.i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped, such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions. but unlike "a scanner darkly" - which suffers from (or indeed is enhanced by) inconsistent character definition (just watch the way some of the hair changes shape!) - renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. when the character is in close-up, added details and texture can bee seen, but when in mid-shot or further away details are omitted, but not to the detriment of character definition.for me, the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one-off project. such a shame, as i would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style.oh, and the english dub is great too.all in all a great film and highly recommended.

much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself (and its film noir influences), so does christian volckman with renaissance.it is the year 2054, in paris. in the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright, sparkling multi-teared jewel. this is a jewel in a setting of misery, inequity and darkness; bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath. one of these "bright" people at the top, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (avalon), is kidnapped. the well known and efficient, captain karas (voiced by the new james bond himself - daniel craig), is assigned the task to find her.the plot and layout is not overly original. it is heavily influenced by film noir, gibson's neuromancer and other detective stories, along with movies like blade runner, sin city, fritz lang's metropolis and minority report. there is the main plot, surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end. it is not hard to figure it all out.the movie's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation. paris is an intricate array of levels and sub-levels. at its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure. as the city rises, so does its architectural complexity and luminescence. yet in this structure, the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior. paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white. the movie is closer in spirit with sin city (the comics) then sin city the movie was with its source material. this is done all the more easy, because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium; animation. much in the same way as a scanner darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling, so does this. the light and dark, black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us. the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time.in keeping with the spirit of the movie, i can be both critic and fan. i can love and loath in the same light. it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts. so pour another black and tan, enter the void and enjoy the ride.

i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed: "a scanner darkly" and "immortel ad vitam". if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy renaissance. it immerses you into the world of a future paris. it is not quite dystopian. they did the animation so well that i thought it was rotoscoped, but from what i can tell, it was not, it was merely motion capture. the facial expressions are amazing! not since tron have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation/live hybrid. the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams, watch for it. the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find. the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises.the plot is secondary, but it isn't terrible. it is noir-ish. there is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth. there is weather. there are "sets" so you can feel like you are in different places in paris. there is some action, and even a car chase. i am going to have to see this one again to get everything. i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.

'renaissance (2006)' was created over a period of six years, co-funded by france, luxembourg and the united kingdom at a cost of around 14 million. the final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic-book style animation, aesthetically similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with 'sin city (2005),' but this film employed motion capture with live-actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format. presented in stark black-and-white, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of paris looms ominously above us. directed by french filmmaker christian volckman, in his feature-length debut, 'renaissance' draws significantly from other films in the science-fiction genre, and the tech-noir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before, but, from a technical standpoint, it is faultless.the year is 2054. the city of paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths, the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings. the city's largest corporation, avalon, achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth, and the company's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process. ilona tasuiev (voiced by romola garai in the english-language version, which i watched) , a brilliant young scientist, is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work, and so it falls to legendary detective barthélémy karas (daniel craig) to uncover her current whereabouts. possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is bislane (catherine mccormack), ilona's hardened elder sister, whose trustworthiness is in question, and jonas muller (ian holm), the dedicated medical doctor who adored ilona as his own daughter.the eerie, dimly-lit city of paris is reminiscent of ridley scott's 'blade runner (1982),' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in 'minority report (2002)' {which was, coincidentally, also set in the year 2054}. however, despite this familiarity, volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit. blending classic film-noir and science-fiction, the result is an eye-catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows, which, i should warn, occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes. the dialogue is a little banal at times, and the story, though engaging, doesn't offer anything strikingly original {except for the ending, which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula}, but 'renaissance' is intended to work best as a visual treat, and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied.

2054. paris is an escher drawing with people and vehicles scurrying along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to fritz lang's metropolis. paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay. and in the blink between surveillance sweeps, a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub. a tough police captain investigates. shown in stark black and white, with the gloomy corridors, shadowy alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard-boiled of film noir, comparisons to sin city are inevitable. but the story owes more to masamune shirow and william gibson than to frank miller, as high tech surveillance, near-invisible stealth suits and ruthless super-corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars. the film never quite generates the doom-laden atmosphere of gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its tech-heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that all seem to have their own ministry of fear, but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent. and as the police procedural plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker recesses of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of avalon corporation's cultivated pr image. the motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between b&w comic books and next generation rotoscoping, and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your tastes. nevertheless, a great visual sense is on display here, and future paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both spartan and baroque. worth a look.

time for hollywood to sit up and take notice! if the actors are acting snooty, all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel. renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings. although the voice overs by the cast (craig, mccormack, pryce etc.) are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the 'cartoons' are unnerving.this style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting. ironically, such technical wizardry makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie. the pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp.plot: disappearance of a mega corporation's top employee unravels a tale of deceit and corruption with a cold hearted hero at the helm. can't say much without giving it all away...except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless.a must watch..even for the 'grown-ups' who smirk at 'cartoons'

i would almost give it 10 out of 10. however, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss-leading which hurt the flow/continuity of the film. the story line is great and well composed; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it. the characters are complicated and so is the story line, expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head, it's a film where all is explained in the end. the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else i've seen in animation. it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it's worth watching it on a good t.v, or plasma. the character voices do save this film in its english version, but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris, i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles. one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it! and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like; waking life & ghost in a shell 2 innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.

there's about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it. beginning with existential themes of blade runner, as well as the vision of the future - with corporate billboards advertising their products, to the technology of the later matrix films and spielberg's a.i., and finally the black and white graphic novel look similar in style of sin city. the creators have put in a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well crafted future neo-noir. add a detective story and you've got an interesting film. i know what it wanted to be, but regardless of the stunning visuals, it wasn't enough to get it to the final destination.

punctuating the opening credits sequence is a swarthy man having a strange, all-too-real nightmare. closing in on its dystopic 2054 paris, the film begins to follow a woman into a grungy club, where she and a slavic bartender convene outside on the deck. they toss exclamations at each other to the effect that she owes him more money although she believes she's paid it all. another woman obstructs the budding violence, only to have a bitter fight with the woman herself. the initial woman storms out, and she is kidnapped. christian volckman's renaissance appears to be another one in an assembly line of recent motion-capture-animated sci-fi noir pictures, but in spite of whether or not that is essentially true, it tells a neatly arranged, classically unraveling detective story that keeps us in the dark in its opening minutes, even whilst introducing karas, the hard-boiled cop we recognize from the beginning as the man awakening from a terrible dream.the rudiments of classic film noir are all hit upon without any anachronistic changes, for all intents and purposes. it is in the harshness of its monochrome that volckman's french thriller has followed no example. for the film's animators, unfettered by the challenges of physical lighting that would normally be faced, have been able to begin with a totally black frame, and to affix utter pitch-white according to the action on screen. as they scrupulously imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame, the distinction of black and white here is full-blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters' less starkly definite moral codes, and the outcome is a harsh and judgmental vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going, sporadically caused to undergo the most blaring and ruthless of illumination. it is the artistic study of film noir taken to their visual boundary of its philosophy, and nothing before has ever shared quite the same execution of this visual concept.all the characters in this decent cyberpunk film seem as if to have been walk off with purely from a gothic comic book in black ink, but all together their physical responses, their motions and the nuances of their facial expressions look ashore within a clear humanity. normally, films that try out new developments in animation allow their technical advances upstage all other facets of production. sin city, for example, left substance and overall good screen adaptation from its source material to be desired.it may not be mind-blowing, it may have its narrative conventions and its voice-over cast may simply be adequate, but renaissance, made for $19 million over six years, not only feels like actual noir instead of a rashly penned appropriation, but also is not secondary to all the visual innovation, which is played as if to be incidental. one leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when karas is evading bullets shot through a crowded glass parisian street, but more about its ponderance of life and death, how life's tragedies, such as death, make life meaningful.

in 2054 paris, avalon, a computer generated system, controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped, detective karas (craig) must go against avalon to find her.renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many.pixar are the animation masters. their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall-e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch. renaissance isn't a film aimed for the young audience though, and like 2007's persepolis, brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation.in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later, christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making.volckman's picture however is a full on animation but it doesn't half look realistic for the majority of it's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time. the faces of the character's are well portrayed and in particular, this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow. the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions. it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed also.for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapirenaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot.the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen. the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we don't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance. renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman, and then we see craig's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements. there are many things wrong with the scripting, not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old, but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages.

every second of the film is gorgeous. and that's why it earns a 7, because the plot is not especially devious, and thinking back over the last 90 minutes i never really felt any excitement or investment in the characters. if anything, the luxurious graphics and framing have made certain scenes (the car chase, for instance) more pedestrian than they ought to be - not that they don't look lovely and have some very original design and occasionally novel camera angles - but they are missing the kinetic movement and close-up shots that are part of the language for any normal action/thriller. the first hour plods along, and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit stagey - people wait for each other to finish and don't always react in a natural cadence, which would be a problem of recording each individual's dialogue separately. on rare occasions the emotions in the voices don't quite match those on screen; something that should really have been avoided. the futuristic architecture is very attractive (lots of glass walls/ceilings/screens, lovely smoke/mirage/special effects) and nice-looking cars, but again - it's more an exercise in graphic design, having no real impact on the story. i'd argue that the whole point of using drawn animation (instead of actors/cgi) is to really push the limits of imagination and design; to do that which is too difficult/impractical in other mediums. although the animation in renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly well-accomplished, i never felt like i was seeing something that hasn't been done before.immortel, another french cgi film, also suffers from an imbalance of beauty over story & pace. to be fair, some marvellous and engaging french movies also have a languid pace, and lingering shots of the look in someone's eyes or the rain on paris cobbles can evoke great emotion - but animators need to understand that while animation brings unique strengths, it also has weaknesses when compared to real-life technique. perhaps it would break from the 'noir' rules that the film wants to stick to, but i think the film-makers also missed a glaring opportunity to explore their future society a bit more - the social strata, the fascistic grip of the corporations etc.i have no problem recommending renaissance to anybody who enjoys stylistic design and/or animation ('manga' fans in particular), but i wouldn't make my other film-loving friends sit through it. take away the sumptuous visuals and it's a barely average film.

just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level, this is a rebirth for motion capture. neither movie nor cartoon, this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir, akira, sin city, blade runner and the new generation of european cartoonists. you see paris the way it almost could be, the characters seem as real as you and i. they blink, trip, shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before.don't go watch it hoping to find a mind twister. you will most likely figure it out before you're half way from the movie. the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers, but this definitely is bliss for the eyes.

a very unique sci-fi animated film, and frankly i love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be, better or worse. this french film is quite interesting to watch, the technique part is innovatory, like "waking life" i recently watched.it took me quite a long time to get used to the black-white style, but eventually i love it, the sketchlike images are really fancy! the contracted future world is a symbol of human race's final destination which i adore it very much.the whole plot is fine for a sci-fi, not so intriguing but it's ok, like some hollywood's products, a giant conspiracy about human's eternity, a little bit cliché and the twisted ending is not so convincing, some development is just too plain and insipid, and the whole movie is too long.so i think i'm just in love with the style this film shows, others are not so good.about the eternity of life, i think most people have come to a unanimousness that we don't want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos. leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but that's also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills one's life and make the world colorful and lively.

i read that this did not well, that the story is not solid, that volckman feels he has failed in some way.i disagree. first, it is well executed. volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique, but to have a focus that is worth thinking about: would immortality reduce the value of life? big question ...i can see he trying hard to build a feeling, and he is not compromising. this is to be applauded. i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form. i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment. i identify this film with this.further, it is much more interesting than richard linklater's roto-scoping, and volckman's story has more meaning than linklater's later stories of a wasted life on drugs. old news. everyone knows it, but no one does anything about it. renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better.well done, volckman. really nice work.

i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with karas and the tasuiev sisters, renaissance.and firstly, that it looks as it ought to look; a boys' adventure, renaissance is the tale of a cop's investigation in search of a missing young scientistilona tasuiev, the geneticist and researcher for the avalon company.the tale of karas, ilona and bislane is, though much less known than sin city, the better movie, and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs. to the french comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful (i have enriched my french comics collection last week, though i'm not so uptodate). the atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are all nice and endearing. a parisian top cop, karas, is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medicalgenetic research, ilona tasuieva mildly hot blonde, whose rebel sister bislane was erotically preferable, i guess.for me, an oldie aficionado of comics and tv series, renaissance, a marvelously beautiful cartoon, was like a replay of a wild wild west episodehere, a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological futuremore jaded and blasé but, in a sense, as thrilling. renaissance is not suspenseful; nor does it look especially wellpaced; but it's seducing and hypnotic. moreover, it achieves sketching, albeit briefly, a world, a true worldand we will think about the avalon, nakata, jonas mueller, the tasuiev sisters, and goran, farfella, and karas telling of his distant childhood in kasbah . i liked renaissance's feel, of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness, and also the professional, assured look; among these new cartoons, this one and linklater's dick adaptation (--the only and first dick adaptation ever--) stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement.i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and, when not conventional, vividly eerie (like the invisibility costumes).as advisable, the characters have exotic names, like bislane and farfella, mostly gathered from the arts and entertainment's world (goran and ilona and naghib ).none seems to have noticed that renaissance's poster features a rourke look-alikethat guy is marv; which doesn't make it a sin city rip--off, but not a paragon of originality either, and in fact there's more resemblance to the miller talenamely, the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society, the brio of the hero (in fact a cross of willis' character and rourke's persona in the previous movie )on the other hand, this cartoon breathes a more public air, a brim of straight adventurousness, and, in a word, it's like sin city for kidswell, naughtier kids i mean, 'cause there's a bit of nudity on display. to what i have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic, even as clichés and common places of the futuristic more adult comics' look; true enough, and it was oldie miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some resemblances here and there. now it's also fair that every ring ought to have its eragorn, so to each sin city, its renaissance. i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales, a rather undemanding specialty.

this is a film i decided to go and see because i'm a huge fan of adult animation. i quite often find that when a film doesn't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles.this film is certainly more about style than story. while i found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films), it was a bit hard to follow at times, and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have. it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together. whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer. visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and in that sense a work of art.if you like adult animation, or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment. i would recommend it. all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better

animation always seems to be fringe. in japan, this might not be the case, but in europe and much more so in the usa animation has a big fat "kids" tag on it. france is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries, home of classics as tin-tin, asterix, lucky luke, valereon and so on(if you've never read these, it's not too late. there's no upper-age limit on them and they don't carry the nerd-stigma of dc or marvel) it seems natural a movie like this one pops up in france. it suits my prejudiced image of the french as art-loving, anti-usa-oriented and talented movie-makers. luckily there's also "a scanner darkly" out there to suppress that view - seems art is pretty much international.anyway, as you might have gathered renaissance is artsy and french. if you're a normal person you will get scared by this. there's no need for that however! beneath it's cool, sleek cel-shaded appearance there's a good thriller and a good movie overall.that was one of my fears for this movie. it's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick, much like sony & c:o are doing with their pixar rip-offs. i was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring and not very engaging movie, but luckily i was wrong.i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well. note: i've seen the french dub which was ok as far as i could see. english might be more interesting what with craig and everything.a final word of praise to the animation. it was awesome. futuristic, well-crafted, nice camera-work, smart solutions(eyes for example looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning i felt like bursting out "this is so damn impressive!". then again, i really like animation and i appreciate the effort the studio put down, so my verdict is a bit biased.good movie anyway, definitely lives beyond it's "gimmick".

picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper-stylized black and white visuals of frank miller's sin city. then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as steven spielberg's minority report or richard linklater's a scanner darkly. an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut. but although volckman's work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them, such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance, volckman's end result, justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that.genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. as such, renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least, with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama, which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion. the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one (although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation - the film's title also becomes far more poignant) managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through. though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers, the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes, making for a truly compelling work.volckman's film truly excels in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight - superbly moody and stylish, it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have. with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot, and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene, the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic, but with a twist, the end result being consistently visually sumptuous. the film's english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting. the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim, stoic policeman karas, and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating. despite a wavering english accent, romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question, and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation avalon. ian holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes.all together, renaissance boasts a visually stunning, unique and compelling futuristic thriller, just as intelligent as it is entertaining. though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be, the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms. for fans of either of the film's intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller, or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted, slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller, the film is without question worth a watch.-8/10

blade runner (deckard is a replicant!), city of lost children (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far less than what we might dream of), anddark city: these really ought to be added.for a while now, i've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as miyazaki's stuff has. this one is the 1st.hmm, scratch the "animated" part of that.i have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly love, right? but, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a wonder to watch.these people did an incredible job!

if the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent movie. i've just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris (where the action of the movie takes place)and i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my eyes...what a visual shock ! i've never seen such a beautiful black&white photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies. i strongly believe there will a before and after "renaissance", similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences. this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative (a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named "renaissance"...) will receive the success and recognition it deserves. vive la france !

i just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire. it's style is definitively unique and very well made. it is filmed with actual actors, but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before. it goes one step further than sin city, and it does it well. it's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures. the story and mood remind of blade runner, and if you liked that one you will surely like this one, too. the storyline is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. this film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely don't like sci-fi or b&w.

i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto, a short film festival in guanajuato, mexico. one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed: one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white.i shouldn't go on with the details 'cause i think it is a film worth seeing. the sci-fi story might be found average for many... to me was really good. the action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere. things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully. the cast performance is good, in my opinion no one hits the wrong note.now, the thing that i found awesome is the animation. 3d grafics look 2d. a bw comic book brought to life. the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand (i'm sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth). the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! the director, she said, is brilliant, but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv. so, many people had true faith in them. they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them.don't miss it. i think you won't regret it... maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think.

first things first, this movie is achingly beautiful. a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter/compositor, the visuals blew me away. every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story, well, it's okay. it's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic blade runner-esquire tales (and who doesn't?) then you will be fine.i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole. i saw it at the cinema in english, but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere.definitely worth seeing.

i highly recommend this film. set in the bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 paris, it is in most respect a classic film noir script: lady in peril, sister trying to find her, honest cop fighting everyone. luckily, it avoids being stereotypical, and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting, innovative visuals. the film might remind you of sin city in look, but it has an even sharper, even more graphic novel look that i found really compelling. each frame, each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. in terms of story and artwork, you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the eiffel tower and sacre couer) and movies like casablanca, as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations. make any excuse you need to see this film.

if you've ever seen the trailer for the film "the recruit" with colin farrell and al pacino, you'll never have to see that film. sadly, renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers.the story of renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher. the setting is a futuristic paris, and science fiction elements feature throughout. the special thing about renaissance, though, is its visual style, and not its story. renaissance is 3d computer animation, like final fantasy, but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. the result looks stunning (although the problems of 3d animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to tome: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden facial acting, etc) as a highly stylised, beautiful film noir, renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience, especially visually. the story and writing, though, are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals. it's not a bad story (and presumably, if you haven't seen the trailer, it's a lot more exciting than it was for me). but it is a story that isn't highly original, and verges on the corny. a few lines of dialogue were painfully corny, making the writing sound like a beginner's first efforts.i will definitely recommend renaissance to friends. it's unlike anything i've seen before, visually, and i believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. it is also a watchable story, even if it isn't perfect.

one reason pixar has endured so well, and been so successful, is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics, they have a story to match their style. and often very moving style at that: affecting, charming and cross-generational. that a lot anime (speaking in broad terms) and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is, i think (and i might be wrong) partly because either the makers aren't bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image, or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous, so enervating that they don't have the energy to create a really engaging story.that same cannot be said of renaissance. there are flaws in its plot, but i'll get to that later. those same flaws, however, are not reflected in the visuals - renaissance is nowt short of stunning. the ultra-high contrast images (sometimes so high-contrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible) and incredible detail are always impressive, always a joy to behold. the futuristic paris on display is the grim offspring of blade runner and brave new world; dark, murky, quite affluent and even clean, but shrouded in intrigue, corporate malfeasance, obsessed with beauty (capital of the catwalk, after all) and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental, sophisticated architecture.it's a compelling environment, not entirely original, but great all the same. the film's much-touted 'motion-capture' technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a black-and-white photographer would die for. not that the detail prevents entertainment, because christian volckman crafts some superb action sequences: a hell-for-leather care chase, a couple of gruesome(ly imaginative) murders, several tussles in the dark and a nasty dust-up in a gloomy apartment. the locations are great, too (i want to visit the nightclub). while the central character of karas is your regular off-the-shelf maverick cop, the other two female characters (who are sisters) are the real motors of the movie. coming from war-torn eastern europe, products of a war, diaspora and a family spat, they're a compelling metaphor for europe as a whole.the film is tremendously atmospheric, its dizzying, swooping faux-camera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience. however, the plot... it never becomes more interesting than the initial hook, in which indefatigable plod karas must find ilona tasuiev, a drop-dead gorgeous and pioneering scientist, after she's snatched from the street. the sinister corporation avalon (is any corporation ever not sinister?), which she was working for on 'classified', projects are hell-bent on her retrieval, and soon karas is up to his neck in official reprimands, dead bodies, cigarette-smoke and narrowly-missed bullets, and falling in love with ilona's sister bislane (very sympathetically voiced by catherine mccormack), as he plumbs the depths of the city's sordid underbelly (and his own past).text-book noir, in other words, but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city (to which it bears a passing visual resemblance), the plot and resolution are dull, the theme of immortality being raised but never examined, and the shenanigans of high-rolling avalon ceo paul dellenbach are also dull , undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension. the basic ideas are familiar sci-fi genre materials, and there's a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane material.however, the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent, even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry. but it's the projection of life in paris circa 2054, the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold. i may be taking it too seriously, and if that's the case i can at least say that it's superbly made, extremely entertaining (and pretty mature, too), and with an ambiance like no other.

a scanner darkly, minority report, blade runner, sin city and sky captain and the world of tomorrow  if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out.french animation project 'renaissance' took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight i finally got to see it at a private screening for the international film festival in stockholm. my spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection is 'huh, neat' and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding 'meh'. it is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface, but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent, as do the flat characters. nevertheless it is clear that the people at onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface. the visuals are staggering. they have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background. for those of you who are not down with the 'technical lingo', the film looks like a fully-animated sin city. its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning. it's a vision. yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons, suspenseful music, heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking. it's every tech-nerd's wet dream...the film zooms in on an eerily-lit, bleak, futurescape paris in which a major corporation called 'avalon' has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance (think the fluid transparent screens from minority report) and genetic engineering. the latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher ilona (voiced by the lovely romola garai). cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and protagonist karas (daniel craig)  a man who takes the law into his own hands  who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving ilona. during this case, he is being aided by illona's sister with whom he also begins a love affair. a very half-assed love affair, if i may say so.the world of renaissance is remarkable. director christian volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads, rats, femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum. the problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story, or the film would have been "too surreal" for mainstream audiences, owing to its lurid animation format. it follows then that we have a multitude of clichéd characters such as evil-laughing villains, sleazy crime bosses and butch tough-chicks who blow smoke every chance they get. it shoves noir in our faces, and it isn't necessary.what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived. it seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot. this is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction. daniel craig helps here too by bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his hard-edged cop character. at one point in renaissance, he is seen in a vivid car-chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top notch sequences of the film. unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and 'renassaince' could benefit from being slightly shorter. in summary, a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience.7 out of 10

i've seen this film in avant-premiere at imagina festival in monaco.i saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, i was waiting to see the final result. i haven't been disappointed.it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. clearly inspired by some comic books, such as the ones from f. miller. in this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent "sin city" adaptation from r. rodriguez. this time, (almost) no grey or any middle color, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film.(can't wait for scanner darkly)the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise.the futuristic story (paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end. despite a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations)the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms...)gives this movie a great interest.despite it is an animated film, this one is obviously not made for children. you won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. it is far closer to a good film noir.i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film: we still feel the well known paris, but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism.nevertheless, i regret a few mistakes. the montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some poor dialogs. even though the technical is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like "final fantasy" did). those little things makes it a 7/10.altogether, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can. the director, christian volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (luckyly, they didn't ask john woo to do the job!).to conclude, it is a film with blasting visuals, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. watch it if you can!please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.

late, great grade z drive-in exploitation filmmaker par excellence al adamson really outdoes himself with this gloriously ghastly sci-fi soft-core musical comedy atrocity which plumbs deliciously dismal and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and jaw-dropping stupidity. in the grim totalitarian future of 2047 sex has been deemed an illegal act by the big brother-like impotent bumbling idiot the controller (an amusingly goofy erwin fuller). however, sweet'n'sexy cinderella (radiant blonde cutie pie catherine erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. with the help of her effeminate fairy godfather (a flamboyantly campy jay b. larson), cinderella attends a grand gala ball with the specific plan of seducing handsome stud tom prince (the dorky vaughn armstrong) and teaching everyone that making love is a positive, pleasurable and wholly acceptable activity.adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his customary all-thumbs incompetence, staging the incredibly awful'n'inept song and dance sequences with a totally sidesplitting lack of skill and flair. the uproariously abysmal "we all need love" number with people in absurd animal costumes awkwardly prancing about the forest is a hilariously horrendous marvel; ditto the equally abominable "mechnical man" routine featuring a bunch of clumsily cavorting robots. louis horvarth's crude, static cinematography, the tacky plastic miniatures, sparky sugerman's groovy throbbing disco score, the copious gratuitous nudity (ravishing brunette hottie sherri coyle warrants special praise in this particular department), the brain-numbingly puerile attempts at leering lowbrow humor (roscoe the robot law enforcer is especially irritating), and the uniformly terrible performances (renee harmon's outrageously hammy portrayal of cinderella's wicked overbearing stepmother cops the big booby prize here) further enhance the strikingly abundant cheesiness to be savored in this delectably dreadful doozy.

as a young teenager at the time, airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their "cowboys and indians" to have amazing gadgets and whizz-bang explosions.in many ways, the show was essentially knight rider in the skies: similar comic-book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of one man making a difference.but in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from knight rider, street hawk, the a-team and other action shows of the time. for one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by stringfellow hawke's possession of airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his mia brother, st john). and then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s cold war context, complete with soviet espionage and central american dictators, not to mention the enemy within. sure, the a-team constantly referred back to vietnam and the team's status as fugitives, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself. with airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (ill-advisedly) diluted as the series went on.with hindsight, the cold war setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are creaky and contrived, and much of what airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. but that's really not the point. airwolf was rip-roaring fun, it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences, and it didn't sugar-coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died. sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a tv budget to boot.for uk readers, dmax (sky channel 155) have just started (jan 2008) daily re-runs of airwolf. set your sky+ box for this blast from the past - we may even get the re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly vastly inferior) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the uk.

one of my favorite shows in the 80's. after the first season, it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast. deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine's character go at it with each other. the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season. unfortunately during those days, blacks did not last long on television shows. some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show. when it went to usa, it was disgusting!!!

i used to watch this show when i was a little girl. although i don't remember much about it, i must say that it was a pretty good show. also, i don't think i've seen every episode. however, if you ask me, it was still a good show. i vaguely remember the theme song. everyone was ideally cast, the costume design was great. the performances were top-grade, too. i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i don't think i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

airwolf the movie, a variation on the original 2 part pilot, yet the movie although shorter, does contain extra footage unseen in the 2 hour pilot the pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie where as a pilot movie is normally the same (2 parter combined) but the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there.worth a look, even if you have the season 1 dvd set, i'd still pick up a copy of the "movie" it's still in some shops like virgin, woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores, although it generally needs ordering, but it saves needing to buy online (as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping) but if you look around airwolfs in storesairwolf was truly 1 of the 80's most under rated shows.a full size airwolf is currently being re-built for a helicopter museum :) info and work in progress pictures are over at http://airwolf.org also with airwolf mods for flashpoint and flight sim games it seams she's finally here to stay :)

so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered. i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly i like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now. i thought it interesting that belisario's airwolf and jag have similar theme - the lead actor (hawke and harm) both are looking for an mia relative (brother, father). wonder if robert belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' theme.question - does anyone have pictures of hawke's cabin. i love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about airwolf.

elisha cuthbert plays sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father, until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face poverty...i was clicking through the channels and found this..i read the synopsis and suddenly saw elisha cuthbert...i thought okay....and watched the movie.. i didn't realise elisha had done films before....'the girl next door and 24' elisha provides a satisfactory performance, the plot is a little cheesy but the film works...its amazing how this young girl went on to become the hottest babe in hollywood!

i found this family film to be pleasant and enjoyable even though i am not a child. it is based on the concept of a high school girl, susan (elisha cuthbert) discovering that the elevator in her upper class apartment building becomes a time machine when a key on a key chain she got from a blind scientist is turned in the elevator lock. she learns how to control the machine (with some uncertainty about time of day).the film is not a work of serious science fiction. you have to ignore the usual instability paradox associated with altering the past through time travel, i.e, the past is changed to prevent the 1881 walker family from becoming poor, but the change means the family never got into financial trouble, so victoria wouldn't have told susan about the financial problems her mother had, which means that susan shouldn't have had a reason to change the past in the first place! but other than that, there are some nice touches in the story, such as the old elevator panel, found in the apartment of the woman who secretly invented and installed the time machine, not having a space for the lock that activates the time machine feature. as in many stories for children, we need to also suppose that a child will not share startling information about a time travel device with a parent or other adult but instead hide the time traveler.it also requires disregarding some poorly staged scenes and uninspired performances by some of the adult actors. (the child actors (elisha cuthbert, gabrielle boni, and matthew harbour) all were very convincing in their parts.) in one scene in the 1300s native americans notice susan observing and photographing them. but they don't register surprise in the sudden appearance of this blond, white skinned girl in peculiar dress. their response is to simply stop what they are doing and to walk calmly towards susan. in the same scene an indian mother is carrying what is supposed to be a baby but is so obviously a doll (its white skinned and its head flops around).timothy busfield, the award winning actor who originally came to fame in tv's old "thirty something," gives a somewhat uninteresting, sometimes listless, performance. in the other extreme michel perron hams it up as the italian building superintendent (janitor), as does richard jutras in his role as a nosy neighbor. (the neighbor's name is edward ormondroyd, which is the name of the author of the novel the film is based on.) i suspect that these problems may be the fault either of the director or possible of a low budget.despite these flaws, i recommend the movie for kids. in addition to the interesting story, it also has some educational value, in that it points out how much both technology and social norms have changed in little more that 100 years.

i love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b/c of the real meaning of family in it, the history of our country, the fun-filled action displayed in the movie. i watch time @ the top about 4 x's a week and i just love it! i wish that a sequel had of been made to see more of susan's dad in the past and watching how susan delt with her new baby sister and having no telephone, computers, gameboys or anything of the 21st century. i hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as i did i guess you could say i'm a time at the top fanatic and i don't mind. the lil boy in the movie robert lincoln walker was simply adorible i wonder who he is and how old he is today. does anyone know if he's played in over movies or tv shows?

a fascinating look at the relationship of a single father in 1998 and a single mother in 1881, tied together by a time-traveling teenager. reminded me of "somewhere in time," richard matheson's "bid time return," as rendered by christopher reeves and jane seymour.

i found 'time at the top' an entertaining and stimulating experience. the acting, while not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic, it is certainly one of the better works in the genre (children's sci-fi). normally, i would say that canada, the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children, and 'time at the top' does nothing to discount this theory! i don't think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people. a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them. both are in abundance in this film. the special effects are good, without detracting from the story, or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations. it would have been very easy to inject an over-load of sfx in this film, but it would have totally destroyed its entire 'raison d'etre'. the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie, and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy. overall, this film is highly satisfactory, and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children's eyes, or those that try to, like myself! now, i really must read the original book, as soon as possible.

the movie was much better than the other reviewer stated. it's a nice family movie. it has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. the story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building. of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. she finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways. she is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. it reminds me of a hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself. it seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6-12 years (maybe a bit older) and it's pretty much pg or g rated. i'm an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" movie - i guess the other reviewer isn't.

in new york, when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm matt saunders (luke wilson) meets jenny johnson (uma thurman) in the subway, he invites her to date and have dinner with him. jenny immediately falls in love for him, they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him, telling that she is the powerful superhero g-girl. after meeting his co-worker and friend hannah lewis (anna faris), the needy jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and matt follows the advice of his best friend vaughn haige (rainn wilson) and dumps her, breaking her heart. jenny turns matt's life into hell, while he has a romance with hannah. however, the archenemy of g-girl and former high school sweetheart of jenny, professor bedlam (eddie izzard), proposes matt to lure jenny to strip her superpowers."my super ex-girlfriend" is delightfully silly and funny. this romantic comedy-adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining. luke wilson is great in the role of an idiot, anna farris is extremely sexy as usual, and uma thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls glenn close in "fatal attraction" or evelyn draper in "play misty for me". my vote is seven.title (brazil): "minha super ex-namorada" ("my super ex-girlfriend")

this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length feature films. the concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the "punch" into this movie. so many lines and gags were left hanging too long, with no definite ending and really didn't leave me laughing. wilson, wilson, farris & thurman were great. wanda sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more of a dvd rental. also, i was looking for some sort of a feel-good music video during the end credits, something that has become sort of a trade-mark to these romantic comedy films, a la something about mary, meet the parents but again, i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines. it felt like it was rushed into theaters.

this movie was one of the funniest movie i've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me. not since my big fat greek wedding (2002) has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense. easily has intricate as last year's mr. and mrs. smith (2005) in its use of parody (espionage in mr. and mrs. smith and sex in my super ex-girlfriend). director's ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and downright ludicrous is great. never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy. at the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance. in some ways, it's so evident that it's great to see how it plays out. just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so evident that one can't really see it. easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie (1982). possibly a nine (depends on how it appears on a second viewing).

my super x-girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride. the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba. uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend. she was just simply fabulous!!! luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good (a lot better than in the scary movie franchise).ivan rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasn't for him and uma thurman this film wouldn't have done so well. this film is clearly a 10/10 for it's cast (uma thurman), it's director, it's screenplay and from it's original plot line. this film is very highly recommended.

i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute. it had all the "sex" content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra, chemistry. uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . both seem to create this odd, twisted and interesting relationship with powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even wanda sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing. though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody, but i have to say i went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy. this movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too...well lets say adult for younger viewers. all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie, tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2* out of 5*)

my super ex-girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less. the story is quiet simple. matt saunders(luke wilson) meets jenny(uma thurman) on the subway and hooks up with her. in the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be ok, but then matt finds out that she's g-girl. at first that seems really cool to matt but it turns out that g-girl is very jealous and needy. so he decides to break up with her and hook up with his colleague hannah(anna faris). this makes g-girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend.what i liked most in the movie are the scenes where g-girl avenges herself on matt. it was also nice to see anna faris in another role then her character from the scary movie saga.i give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a nice comedy.

of those comments here before mine, i mostly agree with edyarb's. the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny, but though managing at some points, in other places it failed. you could see them wanting to make a joke, but no one in the audience laughed. (also agree with edyarb's view on the end credits: leave it normal or make it cool, but not what they've done now.) ok, that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie. i enjoyed it; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket. the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature, like luke wilson's character matt asking the super chick "p*nis or bed?" when she told him she'd "get him a new one" after a wild night in bed, ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore.i cannot, however, agree with bgs1614,who says that the film could earn an 'r' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that. some sexual acts yes, but nothing explicit, only humorous, and no nudity whatsoever. (maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more...?) i'd like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever: superman returns and click. i didn't really expect anything from either one - i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic (which i wouldn't oppose) film. superman surprised me with actually having me feel good(goosebumps!) about seeing his first heroic deed, like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it. but for the rest of the story i'd rather watch my super ex-girlfriend, at least it offers some surprises. click again was a total surprise, much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie. the jokes also work much better than in ex-girlfriend, both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones.anyway, the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i've seen, within a very short period, and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all. i'd rank them click, girlfriend, superman.

well, this is an ivan reitman film. with the rare exception, ivan likes to entertain. his films generally aren't "deep", but they are often entertaining enough. my super ex-girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would. uma thurman is just so grand, and i love her portrayals. i like luke wilson too, and rainn wilson was a straight hoot. never taking itself seriously, the film is over the top and yet isn't very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before.... it's a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain. it's escapist fun and there's nothing wrong with that. when you strip away the "super-girl" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. it's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. and in the end, the characters are looking for love. not all of them take being "dumped" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist.

a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. she refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. and there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. it can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.in short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. and imo, it succeeds at being a nice film. it's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable.so. thin story, but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time.7 out of 10 broken hearts

the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot, as we have seen so many "super-people" movies these years... and in fact, i really liked it, as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn't expect. uma thurman performed as average in g-girl's role. surprisingly, i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen (like in the beginning of kill bill). luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman, i could really get into his situation. if you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch g-girl's and average matt's adventures, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.

my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? it was! but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of. i know that this was a very cheesy movie, but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work.jenny johnson(scary, that's my best friend's actual name) is not your typical average librarian looking woman, when matt, your average male, asks her out, he's in for more than he expected, he's asked g-girl out on a date, the super hero of the world! but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart, but jenny won't have it since he's fallen for another girl, hannah, and she will make his life a living hell, i mean, let's face it, he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break up with.the effect were corny, but you seriously move past them quickly, the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie, it was such a step up from prime. my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it, anyone could.7/10

a big surprise, probably because i was expecting it to suck. the reviews were pretty dismissive of it, even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden: a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero, and finds, when he wants to break up with her, that she's kind of a psycho. i kept expecting it to fall apart, but it never really did. sure, it doesn't make as much of its awesome premise as it could, and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film's universe. but i can't blame it for that. uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero, g-girl. and i've discovered, after several years of disliking him, that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub. he's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in the pretty much unreleased idiocracy). i absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex. it's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. my only real complaint is that they make g-girl a bit too much of a psycho, like almost unbelievably so. maybe with some background i could have accepted it better. i can forgive its flaws, though, because i had a really good time watching it. underrated, for sure.

on paper this looked like a great concept: average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator, who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis. however, director ivan reitman and writer don payne (of the "simpson's") almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g-girl (played by striking uma thurman) come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson. the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders (luke wilson) following his rescue by g-girl from the statue of liberty. jenny curiously asks matt what was g-girl like. matt replies, "she's kind of nutty" i think the intent was to have jenny (thurman) be this lonely young woman, who has no one in her life, isolated by her great physical powers. thurman does the best she can, but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac. luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend."my super ex-girlfriend" is also a victim of bad timing, coming on the tail end of "superman returns" which plays superhero straight up, so to speak. with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought "my super ex-girlfriend" was funny and enjoyed the movie. given that this is an ivan reitman movie, this could have been a lot better. reitman starts with a great premise, and really squanders it. first off, we all love the hero. here neither jenny nor g-girl is really all that likable. this is surprising for uma thurman, who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence. in the beginning her jenny/ g-girl is just plain weird. shocking. because if there is a woman who can play a superhero, she is thurmanshe looks great. only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic, instead of caricature. although "my super ex" is not a straight superhero story, rather a romantic comedy of sorts, it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain. here we have professor bedlam aka barry (eddie izzard) who really is evil lite. he is no lex luthor. no plans for global domination. bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g-girl, and expectedly it has to do with their shared past. what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or g-girl? luke wilson's matt is just "some dude" who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero. one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn (rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation). wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense, and this dilutes his likable charm. this does however work, in the comic sex scene with jenny. matt while dating jenny/ g-girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker hannah (perky anna faris). so how does matt break up with g-girl? well, it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious.dramatic superhero movies work. romantic comedies with chemistry work. what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies. everyone loves the hero. however, hero nut job? maybe not. with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly. and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne. thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings. "my super ex-girlfriend" is fun and funny. though given all involved, the movie could have been super.

this movie answers the question, how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent, clinging, needy, jealous .. and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women?without spoiling the movie, i can safely assure you it does not, but there's great fun to be had along the way. uma thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine, an uber-babe, mysteriously named g-girl, who unlike most in her sisterhood, is not *always* dedicated to truth, justice, and the american way. thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft, yet somehow still fetching, curator jenny. when she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival, g-girl goes ballistic, and what follows is not pretty. it's funny, but it's not pretty ..it's a delightful premise, hell hath no fury like a super-heroine scorned, and those involved don't altogether carry it off, but it has its moments, and i think i'll get the dvd.i liked this movie ..

overall i was rather impressed with the pilot. the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o.c but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle.bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext, there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose. here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films/television shows, which deal with the subjects i referenced, i think you will find at least something here.in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way, i especially liked how they explained where the cylon's belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers.the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays 'lacy rand'. while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something i think needs work. i also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop, but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident.based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where 'caprica' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did.

a prequel to the re-imagined battlestar galactica series, from the same creative team ronald d. moore and david eick as well as new series co-creator remi aubuchon. caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of battlestar galactica. the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the cylon race.the pilot and the series are set to follow two families; the graystone's which include daniel (eric stoltz) a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter zoe (alessandra toreson), while the adama's include joseph (esai morales) a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica.like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric stoltz, esai morales and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including alessandra toreson and magda apanowicz.for fans of battlestar gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different. in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series. the scenes on caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel, this is achieved through some of the architecture, the costumes and the way it is shot.while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg is far more important. we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one, as well as issues related to crime and government.the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv, the series is set to start in 2010.like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in vancouver

just as the new bsg wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting, caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting (for the most part). it is a very interesting, if not somewhat self-involved show, or at least the pilot is.if you're looking for the big cgi thrills of the (new) bsg, you'll be sorely disappointed. if you liked the drama, you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with.the storyline does examine on how the cylons were developed, why adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. the writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing god(s)' and the creation or re-creation of 'human' life. it will be interesting to see how this plays out.i found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others, but all in all it was promising. a small part of me wishes (or hopes) there might be some minor inklings of bsg in there (aside from the back story i mentioned), but that would probably convolute the storyline too much. like bsg, i'll have to wait and see if caprica grows on me, but it's way too early to tell.it would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but i'm willing to give it a chance. overall, i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the (proverbial) towel'.

first off, this is an excellent series, though we have sort of a james bond effect. what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, dr. no (1962) being the second, while in golden eye, the first film with pierce brosnan, judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male "m" so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double-0, aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? this is more or less a "poetic" license to thrill. we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained. no, the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago. in the 1960's communicators were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. omg, do you think 400 years from now, they would have perfected rogaine for jean-luc picard? so, please, let's give the producers some leeway.but to try and make things a bit consistent, let us just ponder about the cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica. if that is the case, where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from? we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. well, what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship, loaded with human-looking cylons, wound up not only jumping through space, but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one. they colonized it, found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves, but not before they themselves sent out a "ragtag" fleet to search for the legendary caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, which they colonized to become the humans, who eventually invented the cylons. time paradox? of course. which came first, the chicken or the road? who cares? it's fraking entertaining!

this is one of those film's/pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps, but isn't necessary. what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isn't something so far away in the future. this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically. the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced & quite talented actors. eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is & he'll do it no matter the cost. paula malcomson of "deadwood" fame is terrific as his wife as well. you are not sure completely of his motives whether it's love or money or both, but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani & her performance. esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again & just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. i didn't think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story. it's great to see adama as a child already being affected & influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage. i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots. this is an almost perfect pilot & i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling. even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. if you haven't gotten into bsg, @ least try this & i'll bet you become a fan & will want to see how the bsg story came to be.

of course the average "sci-fi" battle star gallactica fan will hate this. that kind of makes me happy. i don't like those cheesy sci-fi shows especially battle-star gallactica and that is why i like this show.the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this (the unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. i read on wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci-fi nerds.this is probably the most promising show since lost. it has the most interesting, clever, and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique.what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime! from young teens running around shooting guns, to and extremely well balanced and complex script, to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better (most anime is too confusing).

the caprica episode (s01e01) is well done as a pilot. really, this episode is the exact same content as the dvd pilot release. that having been said, episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular "battlestar galactica" series (both the original and the 2007 remake). it significantly applies most to the 2007 series. as is the trending plots of sci-fi of late, this series explores "virtual" life or environment. on top of this, we are given much background on the adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed (in the battlestar galactica series) creator of the cylons. to the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular topic of "virtual" life and (as is expected) early life of the colonies, and the birth of the cylons. over all, i rather enjoyed this episode. although, it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the dvd release of the caprica pilot, the series seems very promising. as is the case with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience (sci-fi community). i'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development. i give this series 8 stars.

bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series. i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season. it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was! as soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title - caprica! although, some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed. there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why.i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology, and alternate fantasies of our world. this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more!

i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review! i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica ( being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe )so i didn't know what to expect...but i did come out with a smile though i must admit...the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters...i won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this.must say...esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama...(father of the admiral in battlestar galactica)i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg...also eric stoltz fits his role precisely...! special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome! don't sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it..without having to have see bsg!.this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci-fi kick!

if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10. i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world. subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise, but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better. the production values are incredible and the acting is first-rate. i don't mind that it doesn't seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, they are two different shows. i'm thrilled that both esai morales and one of my all-time faves, eric stoltz, are back in my life (if only weekly) as i've missed them both. this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing. you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in plot lines, characters and, of course, the various virtual worlds. we all know how it ends, but the journey is looking to be quite a ride.

i haven't seen bsg, i tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it. however, i saw caprica rebirth yesterday i felt a little lost, so i decided to watch the pilot today and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now i want to watch bsg as well.but what i really liked is that i didn't have to be a hardcore bsg fan to understand what's going on in caprica. from what i have read in the net, they were trying to reach the female population since bsg reached way more men, and at least in my case it worked.however, i suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot.

im really addicted to caprica, because it's a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica. it really has a slow pace start, but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air.i have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season.this sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres.eric stoltz does an amazing job, as well as polly walker as clarice willow!!totally worth checking out!!catch caprica on fridays at 9pm/8pm central on syfy

well i have to say that i have waited for it to come.i won't try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot. on the other hand i'm not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be bsg fans and not like the pilot.what the frack did they expect?!! the background is setting 50 years before bsg we are there o assist at the birth of the cylons, see the life of the adama family (has we already knew some of it from bsg), get a deeper explanation of the caprican population and its perception of the other colonies, and potentially the origins of the gods belief of the human and the unique god belief of the cylons. i do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series, i make the difference between the two although i know that caprica will reinforce bsg.this is 1h30 of promising start, i believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as bsg. i expect a lot from the following but i have no reasons to doubts that we will learn a lot more.watching the dvd's deleted scene also gives more material for your brain to chew on.looking forward to january 2010

this is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on tv at the mo.i was impressed right from the start. don't be put off if your not a sci fi nut (like me...) this could be happening on earth, the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. there are no space ships or laser guns (none yet anyway) so far i've seen up to s01 e04 and i'm gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities.the cast play there roles with pasion. eric stoltz is especially strong.this show really stands alone well, it doesn't matter if you watched bsg or not, in fact they are quite different. i've read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but i would say ignore them.this is a really positive start to a show. lets hope they don't cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days.

i must admit, i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by ronald d. moore wielding the retcon-wand.i was wrong!the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. the accessibility is marvelous! of course, seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the bsg pilot). the pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.don't be mistaken: "caprica" is not bsg. we are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. the casting maintains bsg's standards; stoltz and morales are simply astounding. morales' portrayal of joseph adama, inspired by olmos' portrayal of william, gives a wonderful glimpse of william's heroic father. stoltz's portrayal of dr. graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsg's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.

to all the haters out there: condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages. that being said, i was a huge fan of bsg, thought it was some of the best tv drama (not just sci-fi) on the air. but it was time for it to end and the story to move on. i liked the bsg epilogue "the plan", but it raised as many new questions as it answered, so i eagerly anticipated "caprica" and i was not disappointed.i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg, and i was pleased that "caprica" is something different, and i personally found the story exciting, in a different way than blazing space battles, explosions and sci-fi special effects (don't get me wrong, i like that stuff too). eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances, and alessandra was just wonderful. i can't wait until next week.

good show.the basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. there is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced. mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys? there is moral decadence in a virtual world. there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. i predict (based on the bsg background) that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery. in addition to this, there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves.this show is not bsg -- at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making. there are not a lot of shoot-em-up or space-based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far.what it does have are very good stories, characters, and themes. it also has good performances from the actors. they can make a culture which is similar to modern-day society, but alien at the same time be completely believable. like bsg, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potential, and flaws. it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties, antique cars, and chicken. but those things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point. whether you are from a mafia-style culture or an affluent and high-tech culture, humans and human nature aren't that different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see in the world today. wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.

i loved it, having been a fan of the original series, i have always wondered what the back story would be - it didn't fail to delight me. i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didn't recognise one person - this is refreshing, much like bsg. it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can't wait for the series to start airing. well done to ronald d. moore and team - excellent job. the special effects, dialogue and acting were all spot on, and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline. i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment, but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci-fi stuff produced in the last decade.

i was blown away by the re-imagined battlestar galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. a hardened sci-fi fan, i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs, and this was good stuff.as such, when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut. i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica, which wouldn't work at all. bsg's story, of a mournful ragged band of survivors, trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors.caprica feels different. where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization, caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and decadent heyday. the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. in true bsg form, caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul.the casting for caprica is also excellent. each character is unique and deep, from the obsessive and distant scientist-turned-entrepreneur, to his troubled and willful daughter, each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles.music, which was used so powerfully in bsg, also plays a significant role in caprica. battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well. caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors. the new caprica is definitely it's own show, pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs. i look forward to the full series.

i have to say, as a bsg fan i wasn't exactly sure what i'd think of this show. i saw it on the big screen at the arclight cinema tonight (as part of the paley center screenings), and the cast and film makers spoke after-wards. ron moore said they 'wanted to make a clean break from battlestar, and do something different, and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they'd gain others". even without their talk, i am now a fan of the new show. but here's what i thought of the film.i loved it. it was really very good. i guess i'm a true sci-fi (or 'syfy' - do i really have to type that?) geek, because i'd totally watch this as a series. it has a strong and rich story, and kept my interest. it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something, which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing. the actor playing "ben" should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs. the actress playing "zoe" seemed a little posy, but she was playing a teenager (and i'm sure i won't be the only one who thought "zoe" was a cylon at first, perils of being a bsg geek). if they're hoping these will be the new bamber/helfer/park, they may want to rethink it. surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.eric stoltz gives a stellar performance as daniel greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go. he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters, traps her, then dismisses and releases her. no sign at all of the 'serial killer' he played on gray's anatomy, really impressive acting.equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is paula malcomson as his wife amanda greystone. she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as stoltz's part, and i completely believed that they are a couple, and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship, something rarely seen these days. i look forward to seeing what happens with this family, and hope they give her as much to do as roslin in bsg- she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid, you cringe, it's really great. not to mention her eyes, which could hold magical powers, that's how intense they are. the scene where she takes on the government agent- very short scene, but beautifully played- really gives you an idea of her power.the other part of the show that did not work 100% for me were the scenes with esai morales, and the mafia type clan of his. he does a good job overall, but i did not believe in this mobs power, nor intimidated by their threats. i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the godfather, they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit. but given time, i can see how this will develop into an interesting 'upstairs/downstairs' kind of thing, with the poor minorities (morales et al) versus the rich folk who rule the planet (stolz et al). and to be honest, i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene.note to bsg fans, the boy playing 'willy adama' doesn't really look much like olmos, but he's just a kid. whether or not he'll be featured any more than he was in this film, who knows? i sure couldn't tell. but it didn't bother me, because he wasn't as interesting as everything else going on around him.polly walker plays 'sister clarice', and she's chilling and odd in every scene she's in. i'm not sure where she'll go or who she'll end up with, but i was very impressed with her acting. in this film she was sort of on the side, but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on. she was nothing like her character in "rome", something i always find impressive in actors.one nice surprise- the music is actually better and less obvious than bsg, even though it's the same guy doing it, bear mccreary. it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise, i'd buy this score if i had the chance.as to the 'panel discussion' after the show, it was hosted by seth green. ron moore was very smart and articulate, david eick was cracking wise (much like his video diaries), esai morales told a long story about how he was cast, and eric stoltz was very funny and didn't really answer the questions ( but i've always had a thing for him). paula malcomson was tough (she took seth green to task for mistakenly saying she was on '24'), and the girls who played zooey and lacey were both darling. grace park and tricia helfer were there as well, answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on bsg. overall a very interesting and wonderful evening.i'm giving the show a 9 out of 10, and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold.note: i just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the holoband was originally made for. i have no idea what that may be, but it holds a great deal of fascination to me.

this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000, but when i see this film, i don't think about that wonderful tv series. i believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick, with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf(angelo rossitto from 1932's freaks). i also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch. my only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. i don't want to spoil any of this film, so go out and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.

bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940's and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones.bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young. after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.you have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in bela's house. bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.the corpse vanishes is worth a look, especially for bela lugosi fans. great fun.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

this is an excellent movie. the cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. the movie is basically about a well-accomplished doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home. once the bodies are at his home, he removes stuff (i hate to use such a general term, but i forget what it was he removed) and puts it into his wife to retain her youth. then a reporter, patricia hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying. she takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place. definitely watch this oldie, but goodie if you can.

i wouldn't say this is a bad movie; in fact it's pretty typical of the type of film that the "poverty row" studios were releasing at the time. filmed for monogram, bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community. in this movie, bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides, and, after their demise, injecting bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young. lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film, however, the movie suffers from the ultra-wooden acting of co stars luana walters and tristram coffin. coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case. i've seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and utterly unconvincing. miss walters is only slightly better, but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable. still, the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end! despite the poor acting by some, "the corpse vanishes" is an enjoyable movie for all to see.

this is not bela lagosi's best movie, but it's got a good old style approach for some 40's horror entertainment.brides are dropping dead at the altar like flies. i think i'd postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught, but it's a horror movie, so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason. anyway, lagosi is a mad doctor, who needs young female blood to keep his aging, sickly wife healthy and happy. he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse (who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse?), and the brides just keep on getting zapped.no movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own. good at solving crime, bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times, guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim. i love the "haunted house" bit where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosi's sinister mansion. hidden passageways, a vampire-like wife, an evil dwarf igor assistant, and so on. good stuff.fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving, and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner. if you like old horror movies, this one is worth a watch.

bela made 9 pics for monogram, but it was only at this one, the 4th, that things started to come together. all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production, writing and character development. from here on, better or worse, the series would also deal with one essential theme: a scientist (usually bela) makes experiments in the basement or the old house (sometimes in the basement in the old house) that causes things to go blooey. this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings. he came on board for black dragons, the flick before, but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click. lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing, and was around for all the rest of the monograms. casting is key in these, and it's a pretty good one b movie wise, here. you get barclay and harlen (also from black dragons),along with russell, who would star in lewtons' cat people movies..and rosetto, from spooks run wild...a nice slice of poverty row talent. if you have limited time and budget, start with this one...it sums up everything they had learned up to this point, and gives you something to compare the rest to. the plot? bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young. they both like to sleep in coffins. if you can read that and smile, the rest will be easy.

rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes, a renfield-like assistant and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (sounds like a greenaway movie actually lol). lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides (why them? who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. he gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar. after another bride bites the dust, a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop, and decides to snoop around for a story. she gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and lugosi. heaven knows where the police were. soon she's off to bela's lair, when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. it all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist, but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision, as he foils her plans, oh no! what will happen? i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. lugosi is great here, his hangers-on are all very very strange, the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable. a fun little view.

one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the well-concocted visuals, the unsettling backdrops, and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel terry gilliam's presence through the experience. "12 monkeys" is evidence of gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. "12 monkeys" is a variation on similar themes of gilliam's repertoire:oppressive/recessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel realms. in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know. this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness. the difference between gilliam and artsy posers is that gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled. his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. the title itself is a mark of gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. all in all, gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience. the film has immense re-watch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. definitely one of my favorites.

time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. they're fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way. film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek: first contact', the 'back to the future' trilogy, 'bill and ted's excellent adventure', 'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage, 'window of opportunity'. heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time.in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film, '12 monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film. repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind.some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard cole, played by bruce willis, as a schizophrenic. most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel.unlike other time travel stories, '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. cole tells his psychiatrist, railly (madeleine stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised. if that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much.if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events...or does it? the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians.bonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing. gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the 'munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'don quixote'. i would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting i've seen. it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved. gilliam's description of the film as his "7½th" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really 'his' film' - doesn't do the film itself justice.brad pitt's portrayal of goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic. watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum. it's disturbing and distracting.probably a coincidence, the louis armstrong song 'what a wonderful world' was used at the end of both '12 monkeys' and the final episode of the tv series of 'the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy'. both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones.'12 monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain. it's not a mindless recreation, that's for sure.

twelve monkeys is an insane time-travelling, action packed movie that stars bruce willis who plays james cole, a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in november of 1996. unfortunately, he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane.this movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from bruce willis, brad pitt and madeleine stowe. twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that i believe anybody can enjoy. terry gilliam has created a true masterpiece10/10

one of the greatest film i have seen this year.last maybe before sun rise, which is also seen late at night alone in the lab. i like the idea of the film,which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate.with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes. i do like the end. but a big question also comes. the virus shall not be released again, should it?in the last scene in the airport. jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists. when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus. and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr. goines assistant. so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus,(james keep an eye on him at the time remember?) and he has teeth. so why everything is still happen?? why future scientists don't do anything after the truth is revealed?? my biggest question after the film...

terry gilliam traveled again to the future (he had already done it in "brazil") to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race.the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and gilliam proves that he's got imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). as for the cast, bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just ok, but brad pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all. he should just play good-looking successful young men.*my rate: 7/10

a very strong movie. bruce is good and brad also.as i think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list bruce remembered.that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job.well, novikov property seems to me work in this movie. however, i do believe in back to the future theory of worlds' multiplicity.so bruce could save the world, but not his world.in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself.and i do believe there is no problem in that. here i disagree with dr. brown from back...but the story pf 12 monkeys has its own beauty. inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost.a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future. the bullet - well it might be some mistake, some falsification.well i like this movie - has to buy a dvd.best.

one of the all-time great science fiction works, as visionary and thought-provoking as blade runner or even gilliam's own brazil. willis gives his best performance here, but he's outdone by pitt's incredibly frenetic turn that's unlike anything he's done before or since. even stowe isn't out of her league here, though. the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about. the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. lots of dark humour on display here. fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography. in my top ten.

"twelve monkeys" is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. it cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named james cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr. kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films.the story is just fantastic. it's so original and so entertaining. the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named "la jetée" (1962) which i haven't seen, but i must thank the director and writer of the movie, chris marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of "twelve monkeys". i read a little about "la jetée", it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by paul buckmaster.terry gilliam, who we remember from monty python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as i really never thought him as a director type of a person. i know he has directed movies before, but i really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. it shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. it's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all.what comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example "the sixth sense" as well, but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well. the character is very well written too, yet performed even better. cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. by hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt. stow plays the role of kathryn railly, the psychiatrist of james cole, who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. she somehow starts to believe cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it, so i guess i'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing.all in all, "twelve monkeys" is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from willis and pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. it's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures i've ever seen. through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing.

i really enjoyed this -- i'm a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. but then, terry gilliam is always good at that (well, almost always. let's just forget about jabberwocky and the brothers grimm, shall we?).i particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes -- the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other.it was also really well done aesthetically -- the art direction was really great, and i wish i'd been able to see it on the big screen. the future scenes had a similar feel to brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling.but perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors i normally don't much like, bruce willis and brad pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. pitt especially -- i'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act (contrary to what i'd originally thought), but this one really outdid them. i actually found myself asking my friends at one point "are you sure that's brad pitt?" this is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admittedly that may not be saying too much).

terry gilliam gives a stunning movie, which i thoroughly enjoyed. bruce willis, madeline stowe, brad pitt and even the small appearance of christover plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant! this is the only terry gilliam film i've seen, and twelve monkeys is definitely in my top 10. i think this is one of the four best bruce willis movies; and brad pitt's best. brad pitt delivers a perfect performance. possibly one of the ten best actor's performance that i've ever seen. he played his role (geoffrey) very convincingly. bruce willis' role (james cole) was also quite convincing. both bruce willis and brad pitt acted extraordinarily well. with the brilliant story to back the great performances; and to back that up, terry gilliam's superb directing.

the story of this film is truly remarkable. a virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say, "the twelve monkeys did it." thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 billion people. apparently animals do not contract this disease. day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (or at least thats what the poster says.) so a current convict named james cole (bruce willis) is sent as a "volunteer" to get some samples from above. after he does his "volunteer" work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin.throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times, from 1990, to some time during the 1950's. (in a middle of a war.) throughout the time traveling back and forth, it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up. the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending. i personally didn't like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed. i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen, but it isn't everyone who thinks this way. so i gave it a 8, but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a 6 or 7.for the whole acting of the film, i give it a a+. bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good, but brad pitt is completely 100% excellent. his acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club. there characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more... insane in this film. so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out. for most people it's a great science fiction film, i just don't think it is a masterpiece.

first of all, we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. the story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. about that. movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. but that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. as far as the direction goes, it is prefect. movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. so, if you are getting ready to see a sci-fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. b there should be more movies like this.

a great addition to anyone's collection.12 monkeys is a movie you don't see every day. it has excellent actors to go with a excellent story. this is not a normal role for bruce willis but he holds the role like he holds john mcclane.the virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it.a man(bruce)is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind.the actors in this were awesome. i must give a mention to brad pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient james cole(bruce) meets in a mental hospital.the director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus.the animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities.this movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own.i very much highly recommend it.10/10

i can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. it is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still i can't decide. i definitely liked it. this is the first movie of terry gilliam that i have seen. my first impression? i was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex(to be confusing).the movie is set in the future. a man james cole(bruce willis) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past(1996 to be specific). a virus killed 5 billion people. he is sent from the future to get some information about it. also involved here are a psychiatrist called kathryn railly. the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life. the loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end.one thing i liked about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life. "you want to see the ocean, be with her" is especially a poignant line in this movie. it chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on. this is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. the complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters.the performances are quite good. bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. his desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. i have to check out his other movies. the gorgeous madeleine stowe is quite a treat to watch. ever since i saw this movie, i have become so obsessed with her. she has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him. brad pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named jeffrey goines. his oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him.the end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. the length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. and every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary.good thriller 10/10

i just bought the dvd and i must say, (after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas) terry does it again. as well of being a fan of the monty python movies, terry gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller, whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as james cole, and as well (perhaps my favorite character) brad pitt who played the insanity of jefferey goines. a must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any type really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. any way the plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race, which is unleashed in the past by "the army of twelve monkeys". james cole( bruce willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists in his time can find a cure. before i go further, james cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. during his stay he meets jefferey goins( brad pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. he also meets his psychiatrist ((madelein stowe) who eventually teams up with bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually brad pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away.

nb: spoilers within. this great movie is "about" so many things, all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story.the ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. whew! such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot, coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples, not to mention the inspiration of chris marker's "la jetee." without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. but there are many other levels speaking here.the movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of james cole (bruce willis, doing the best work of his career here). his journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again. the other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between james and dr. kathryn railly (the wonderful madeleine stowe). i love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters. for me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene. by this point, james  once gripped by an unshakable determination  now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality; while dr. railly  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced, after absorbing james's proofs, of his horrific predictions. her desperation to get through to james and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come.gilliam makes us care about these characters, especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives. the balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite. and the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through james's dreams. it is here, just after james has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind. see jose and the gun (just before this, the references to hitchcock's "vertigo" and identity switching/confusion are brilliant.) this is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people; it not only holds up under repeated viewings, it demands them. "twelve monkeys" is intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny, and suspenseful stuff.the supporting cast is excellent, especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as jeffery goines, crazed and spoiled, but ever the survivor. and there is david morse as dr. peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation) and christopher plummer as dr. goines. but the biggest accolades belong to terry gilliam, surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding "brazil." (lots of parallels, of course, especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings: lunacy within, lunacy without.) every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone. the soundtrack is terrific, too.this is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come.

normally i try to avoid sci-fi movies as much as i can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. light sabers, ufo's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. however, there is one movie in the genre that i'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this "twelve monkeys" i remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, i'm still one of its biggest fans. every time i see it, this movie seems to get better and better.somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. james cole is one of them. he's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. they believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'the twelve monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. but their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets dr. kathryn railly, a psychiatrist, and jeffrey goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...what i like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of the twelve monkeys? those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. if the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, i'm sure that i would never have liked it as much as i did now. it's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. but that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. the acting is amazing too. normally i'm not too much a fan of bruce willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. together with madeleine stowe and brad pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.even after several viewings, i'm still a huge fan of this movie. except for this movie, i have only seen one other terry gilliam movie and that's "fear and loathing in las vegas", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. however, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. i give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10.

terry gilliam's and david peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. people's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  i especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.the story itself is engaging: one man, james cole (played by bruce willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. but because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. with such a complex movie, it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess, but instead twelve monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.i watched this movie once around 10 years ago. it marked me a lot: i remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. i've re-watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it's better than i remembered it. brad pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing jeffrey goines  almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. pitt's oscar nomination was well deserved! surprising was also bruce willis' performance: his i didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. cole is a rather ambiguous character, peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. ironically cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole's shrink, dr. kathryn railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. but then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.there are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club, and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. the twist is brilliant, but i prefer this ending for emotional impact. madeleine stowe is very good playing dr. railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. it reminds me of chinatown in that sense, the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.the twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling cole's mission hasn't been in vain. twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. it's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.

without a doubt, 12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci-fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality. an apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. excellent use of philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place.bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen. he is actually sane, but the people of the future (or present if you will) distort this guy's head so bad through time travel, no wonder he unravels. he gets sent to world war i just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it. they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance, we get to see willis, madeleine stowe and an ominous brad pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years.stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as cracked up as he seems. a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of "seeing" each other before, in another place or time. 12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present, when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world.the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for willis' plight to complete his mission which is, against all usual hollywood stereotype, not to save the world. he is gathering information. the film plays tricks on the viewer as well, placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin. this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making. he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time bandits, and brazil. the screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films. if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 monkeys.rating: 9 of 10

a linear travel within a non-linear structure. it's a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this come-and-go between present, future and past. however, the movie's linearity can't be avoided: it's the very work of the projector, the unfolding of the narrative.what we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. the world of this terry gilliam film is a world with little space for free-will.right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic's prophecy, according to which a plague would rule the earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus.cole's (willis) mission is clear: return to the mid 90's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus. there's no way to change the past: all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present (that, for us viewers, is the future) find the cure. not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the present better.in his "returns" in time, cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present.the latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect "volunteers" (this word is incisively ironic) to embark on the journeys to the past.the scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel, and cole ends up on wrong dates - this will, later in the plot, work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist kathryn (stowe).we can see, through the evolution of the story, that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality.there is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climactic - appears. it modifies itself, according to the evocation of cole's memories, that come up in his dreams.in an airport, a man is shot dead while running, armed, toward someone else. a blonde woman runs after the murdered one.this is the scene that connects the past (in which cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the narrative) and the future (adult cole) throughout the narrative, cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now. his prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. the agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist, doctor peters (morse), that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease.what was can't be changed. and, in cole's case, what was is what will be. eternally.a film not quite well understood for many. to me, nothing less than a masterpiece.other good movies with similar theme: the back to the future trilogy (that has another angle regarding the "mad scientist" character, and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - particularly in the second film -, it is way more optimistic than gilliam's work, that is an odd hollywood picture).in another register, there is "wild strawberries", one of bergman's masterpieces, that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences.i've never watched "la jetée", but only because i can't find it.

the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow. but good there is also a pause-button. bruce willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like, terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. this ex-monty phyton man knows exactly how genius sf-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic brad pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some schwarzenegger-wanna be. it's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. one of my big favourites.

there is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between bruce willis and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkeys. gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the fifth element) and handed it to butch bruce. it was entitled "things bruce willis does when he acts". it ended with a simple message saying: "please don't do any of the above in my movie".there is a fact about this movie (definitely true). gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.i would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is the twelve monkeys.visually, the twelve monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film. it is also full of gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. although the ending of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, gilliam borrows heavily from kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. it is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.i love gilliam films (brazil, in particular). but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. he seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (brazil, in particular). i still maintain that brazil is gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that the twelve monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-python.whatever the truth of the rumour above, gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - brad pitt.it's been over a decade since this film was released. when i watched it again, i realised that it hadn't really aged. i had changed, of course. and this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. a first rate film. 8/10.

with 'twelve monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate. i know i did. the story is interesting and deals with time traveling. a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole (bruce willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. there he meets jeffrey goines (brad pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. he also meets psychiatrist dr. kathryn railly (madeleine stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing cole's stories.the movie constantly plays with time. cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and "they" send someone. for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. you could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.'twelve monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. may be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. that was the easy part for me.

stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. the fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.terry gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film. he gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy. his world, the world in which twelve monkeys transpires, is a place where the mad run wild, where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect, where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence, where madness looms at every corner. this is a very dark movie, but his very best, most linear (despite the plot twists which hold up under examination), and one which gets better with repeated viewings.a tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of life on the planet as we have known it leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity's fate on the earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time, among them one james cole (underplayed to great effect by bruce willis). cole could be any person. we don't know anything about him, but in a way, that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. what we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality: he may have already been at the scene of the event of 1996.it's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. when taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets jeffrey goines (spastically played by brad pitt, oscar-nominated here) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction, and later cole believes he has seen goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? he doesn't know. later he meets a psychologist, kathryn railly (madeleine stowe), and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane, and that she's seen him before. this becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that something terrible is coming this way, especially when she meets him six years later: she has seen cole before. at the same time, cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (jeffrey goines?) has apparently escaped, not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. the questions arise: have these events happened? are they going to happen? who is really a part of this, or better yet -- is everyone, down to the smallest player, a part of a greater plot? or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again? these questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece vertigo in which madeleine elster/judy barton mourns her own brief existence ("you took no notice," she says, as cole and railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in). snippets of dialog from vertigo form a foil to the dialog between railly and cole and later, when cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for railly, he comes face-to-face with her in disguise (looking almost exactly like eva maria saint from north by northwest) as the swelling bernard herrmann score plays the emergence of judy barton, dressed as madeleine elster. it's a fascinating sequence, more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films: madeleine stowe plays kathryn railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself "judy simmons" while helping an "insane" man named james cole; james stewart plays a detective who tries to help "insane" madeleine elster who will later re-appear not once, but twice, first as brunette judy barton, and later, as madeleine. action and re-enaction, play and re-play.

terry gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of chris marker's short film la jetee is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast. gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole (willis at his most steve mcqueen-like -- better than mcqueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals. willis, the justifiably oscar-nominated brad pitt, and madeline stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers. even paul buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting. this one's a don't-miss!

i had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film. at the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were "awesome. just awesome." i like to think i can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so.the story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. back with universal after his long, arduous battle with them over "brazil", terry had achieved what he wanted most; the "final cut". terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. it is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.the universal collector's edition dvd of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. it contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called "the hamster factor and other tales of 12 monkeys". it tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair. fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success. 

just kidding, i rented 12 monkeys the other day because i am a huge bruce willis fan and i heard some things about the film. some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so i was a bit worried. just because i felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that i had to watch several times to get. but i watched it last night and i was really impressed, this movie had everything in it: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. the actors all did a terrific job, i give a lot of credit to bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. but brad pitt, i'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. he didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. the story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.james cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send james to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. james gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, dr. kathryn raily and another mental patient, jeffrey goines. he tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. but the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by james, but he tells her more, and believes him. now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.12 monkeys was an incredible film. like i said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. but the whole movie was just great, the cast, the sets, just the whole picture was a great one. it had a terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. what is right and what is wrong? who knows? but i would highly recommend 12 monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.9/10

"twelve monkeys"'s got all the elements to become terry gilliam's masterpiece. an outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. "twelve monkeys" is also the first movie where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in "die hard"). no matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. the movie contains a very thrilling end too. it's got a real dramatic power. but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). no matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.

terry gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts bruce willis' best performance ever.what sets 12 monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that bruce willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to. also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed. as willis asserts "it's already happened," while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself. it's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by peoples and gilliam's unique brand of dementia.besides this, 12 monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of hitchcock's vertigo. all serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.visually, gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling tim burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery. with cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters. the scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.performance-wise, brad pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an oscar nomination. as mentioned, bruce willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. equally good is madeline stowe as willis' psychologist. she holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10

this movie is completely ridiculous. not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrendous. the special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. yet, it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced. it is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any el camino's. there are also other aspects which i will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic. i highly recommend this movie, just because of its utter idiocy. i have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch exterminators of the year 3000!

robert jannuci,luca venantini, venantino venantini, alicia moro (two stars are from city of the living dead (i wonder what luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something, like bela lugosi jr. or david hennessey there kid from dark shadows who wants to forget dark shadows existed). anyway, in the thorn emi video there's no music over the opening credits . . . but the music is great once it comes in . . . with the italian movies the films aren't as good as the music . . . my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot arm following loner-alien through the desert. alien says why are you following me. tommy answers because i feel like it . . . alien replies which way are you headed tommy says west then alien says well, i'm going east. so after a while of walking, the theme playing in the background alien looks up and sees tommy sitting on a rock petting a pet hamster . . . tommy looks up and says to alien, what took you so long . . . i love this movie . . . it touches my heart. the boy with the robot arm needs a daddy and alien is drafted in to being tommy's daddy in the desert . . . oh yeah, they need water too . . . not the road warrior (mad max 2) by any means but a silly western/post nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and alien and trash and a few other good guys with a mean chick with an iron claw and crazy bull who looks like wez in the road warrior . . .on sunday afternoons on channel 57 (philadelphia, pa) after church i'd come home and find this on . . . often . . . too often. love it. 10/10

when i saw the exterminators of year 3000 at first time, i had no expectations for that movie. although, it wasn't so bad as i was thought. it's kind of italian version of roadwarrior, with cast, that is almost famous in italy, including venantino venantini. behind the story is elisa briganti and dardano sacchetti, who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh-eaters. you can also see other links to italian horror movies: luca venantini plays the role of tommy, and you can see that kid in paura nella citta dei morti viventi (city of the living dead aka gates of hell) as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of mary's brother. quite entertaining movie, with some dull parts.

i first saw this movie on a local station on the sunday afternoon horror show back around 1969 or 1970. uncut. i was just a little kid at the time, but i loved it and wasn't really that scared by it. i thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline. thinking back, i'm still surprised that it was shown during the day on t.v. uncut in those years. i've sought out this film ever since, seen it over and over again, and always loved it. one would think john waters would have idolized this film. it's got to be not only a scary film, but one of the sleaziest, trashiest films ever made at that time. and surprisingly, you don't hear about this one as having the cult following that a movie such as "blood feast" or "the hills have eyes" have acquired over the years. it has a cult following, but it should have really become a cult classic, in my opinion. as far as i know, this came out a little before blood feast came out, making this probably one of the first true "gore" films. in fact, this movie has elements of hershell gordon lewis and a little russ meyer thrown in for good measure.anyway, i recommend this for anyone who likes trashy, sleazy, black and white horror films from the early '60's (i think the date at the end of it read 1960).

this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released. there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date. however, i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on dvd. actually, i do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common. therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd. firstly, there was a theory about how naives our generation was. secondly, i think there is something more. i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers, specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre. this is the mutilation, the idea which gives coherence to the film; the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture. i remember how sick the sensation was, when the monster rip kurt's arm out. and at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes, no matter if the action is on a secret lab, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a striper dressing room, and so on. may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things. for example, in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fiancée's head a more accurate work, made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting. same thing with all action scenes, including the one of kurt's arm. furthermore, something could be done with the monster's make up. some remakes have been good; i think in this case an attempt would worth while. nevertheless, the black and white tones should be conserved.

i love buying those cheap, lousy dvd's from alpha video. one day, i happened to buy this one. it's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50's, all sexed up. replete with unscientific everything, scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama, it's an enjoyable film, to those who appreciate this kind of stuff. and if you can 'suspend your disbelief' enough, you can actually get creeped out-- not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet, but toward the end, with the character of 'the perfect body'. it's so . . . . what's another word for mindf***ing?

when i was young i had seen very few movies. my parents in all their wisdom rented this one. i was very wary of what the movie was about, in fact i wasn't even allowed to watch it. my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry. so what did i do? late at night i trashed the vcr! kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals. i was arrested of course, i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived. i was only given a stern talking to and sent home. my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr. this tore me apart, slave labour really sucks believe me, but i had to do it. chores all around the house. what happened in the end? we got a big screen tv, dvd player and a surround sound system for my work. how did i get the money? easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney! do you remember finding neno? well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks! they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done! in the end i never saw the film the head that didn't die and the rating i gave it is my life rating! it's doing pretty good!

this movie scared heck out of me when i was just a kid. it's no "citizen kane" but it has its moments. the arm ripping scene is good. the plot is good even if characters aren't - could have something to do with the acting. put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get. this was one of those shoot, edit (what little there was) and distribute in a couple of months type of movies. this is classic low budget sci-fi and deserves it just due. i rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age.

i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. first off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. the acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(herb evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(leslie daniels as the assistant kurt)to first-rate with virginia leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk. issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. this film is a thinking film in many ways. however, don't be too fooled by its real intent. it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. one other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.

the brain that wouldn't die was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962. today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959; the thing is both lurid and lewd, but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way.the story, of course, concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs--and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab. with the aid of a few telephone cords, a couple of clamps, and what looks very like a shallow baking pan, he brings her head back to life. but is she grateful? not hardly. in fact, she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing, particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body.as it happens, the doctor is picky about this new body: he wants one built for speed, and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks, haunting strip joints, visiting body beautiful contests, and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow. but back at the lab, the head has developed a chemically-induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments, this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet. can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance, wreck revenge upon the doctor, and save the woman whose body he hankers for? could be! leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly; virginia leith, the unhappy head, screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords. busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music, actors make irrational character changes from line to line, the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot, and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs. on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie.director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip, and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors, who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it. the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost, but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release, and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with.now, this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious, depending on your point of view, so it is very hard to give a recommendation. but i'll say this: if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers, you need to snap this one up and now! four stars for its cheesy-bizarreness alone! gft, amazon reviewer

this film is an absolute classic for camp. that is why it was an elvira and mst3000 classic. everyone knows the story. scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks. finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced chick's head on top. the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant's remaining "good" arm (his other is not right from a scientist's earlier failure), and the whole place burns down.the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing it. as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four. only one of those scary movies was really any good (the original "the haunting".)i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers. its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies (complete with porno sound track) scares the hell out of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing. i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i'd rather go to the dentist than watch "chicago" again.seven is the most i can give it, because its entertainment value is mere luck. the film , as cinema, is a disaster.

this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw...i was about 5 at the time. it scared me good! but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster...and my mom got very upset. she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint! now that's a movie! hey for it's time it was a great movie. that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then. and if your 5 it is very scary! kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination. your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects! (imo)

i truly enjoyed this film. the acting was terrific as was the plot. jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for. the only part of this flick i would change was the ending. the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel.there were some interesting religious messages in this film. jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented the anti-chirst. there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that 'end of the world feel'. i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature. i know many people won't get the references to christianity, but if you watch close you'll get it.

this is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man type critter on an uncharted island, then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them! lots of bad gci, goofy plot elements, and babes sweating in tight t-shirts follow.these monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this one spices things up with a bit of humor (i guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek), not to mention the sexy babes. but let's mention those sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight t-shirts, sweating profusely. one's in her undies at the beginning, another at the end. thank you, thank you, makers of bad movies! the plot is full of goofy stuff, a guy drives up in a jeep, slams it right into a tree, then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter. yeah, um, well, how 'bout we think about that for a while; we'll get back to you. the sharkman is hilarious - either awful cgi or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit. the mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; he's evil, that's his motivation, he makes no apologies.overall, if you want a stupid, fun b-movie, this one should do the job.

poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... awesome. the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. haha. good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. i highly enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a good laugh. i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious. i can not, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. however, if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy, i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. very simply. so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. it brought some joy into my life.

like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title, michael oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous. the producer's last outing, "mosquitoman-3d" had the same problem. it's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it. the only draw for hammerhead: shark frenzy was it's passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface. but even that was only passable. poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish. with dolphins and whales, the technology is all but wasted. cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imax's stunning 3d capabilities. there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety. close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth. michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got shark-week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.

when i heard about "hammerhead" being released on dvd and finally found it at my local dvd store, i thought "well, just another cheap monster movie from nu image". those guys around boaz davidson and avi lerner produced cheap but very entertaining b - pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies. so i didn't expect much, especially after having watched the rather disappointing "shark zone" just a few days before. but "hammerhead" turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies. we have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, man-eating plants and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. everything you need for an entertaining monster movie. the only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie was made for tv it's understandable why these scenes are missing. and it doesn't matter anyway cause "hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment at it's best. there are two reasons why i gave it seven out of ten points, though: first of all, the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and secondly, william forsythe just isn't the right guy for the "hero" part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter tylo. other than that, i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there. grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. jasper p. morgan

i have always been a huge james bond fanatic! i have seen almost all of the films except for die another day, and the world is not enough. the graphic's for everything or nothing are breathtaking! the voice talents......... wow! i love pierce brosnan! he is finally bond in a video game! he is bond! i enjoyed the past bond games: goldeneye, the world is not enough, agent under fire, and nightfire. this one is definitely the best! finally, mr. brosnan, (may i call him mr. brosnan as a sign of respect? yes i can!) he was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game....... at long last! duh! i've seen him perform with robin williams, and let me tell you, they make a great team. pierce brosnan is funny, wickedly handsome ( i mean to say wickedly in a good way,) and just one of those actor's who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug, saying: "pierce brosnan, thank you for being james bond," "if it wasn't for you, i wouldn't know who james bond is." he's a great actor! i am a huge fan of willem dafoe even though i've seen him in a couple of movies. his role as nikolai diavalo was brilliant. (did i spell the character's name right?) lol!!!! he does a great job with an accent. sometimes i can't even hear an accent. i have seen willem, i mean mr. dafoe, perform in two movies: finding nemo, and spider-man with my favorite actress: kirsten dunst! she rocks! anyway, he never ceases to amaze. and richard kiel, wow, he's definitely got the part of jaw's nailed. i've seen him in the movie's and he's awesome! as a matter of fact, my grandparent's have met mr. kiel, and i was jealous when they told me. but, kirsten dunst is at the top of my list of celebritie's that i want to meet. john cleese was breathtaking. i have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking, and gadget creating q! mr. cleese was hilarious! i've seen him work with pierce brosnan in goldeneye and tommorow never dies. he's awesome! john cleese's most recent project is shrek 2 starring mike myer's, cameron diaz, julie andrew's and eddie murphy. ( shrek 2 is now in theatre's!) good luck 007! oh, yeah, and as q alway's says: "grow up 007!"

** warning - this post may contain spoilers **i only got a gamecube in september 2005, and the first two games i bought were james bond games, the decent agent under fire and the dull goldeneye rogue agent. the next game i planned to get was everything or nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games i already had. i have to say, he was right. i bought this for a tenner in hmv, and when i got home, i slammed it in to my cube and played it for hours on end. it was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. graphics were some of the best i have seen (but now that the xbox 360 has come out, farcry instincts predator has some of the best graphics known to man). the storyline was clever; mad man (willem dafoe, named as nikolai diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (heidi klum, named as katya nadanova), try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which at the start of the game, you, james bond, have to destroy on a train. the bad thing is that one of them is hidden in katya's boobs. you then have to thwart their plans and save the world.the great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters, such as cleese voicing q. there are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky.gameplay - 10/10 graphics - 9/10 sound - 9/10 replay value - 7/10 multiplayer - 8/10i give this game a grand total of 90%

goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history. their is no doubt about that. but this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern-day bond champ, of its time.this was not a bond game based on material from another medium. this was a completely new; scripted game. which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike, you'll enjoy it.unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. which gives it that more cinematic feel. with a very 'bond'-able storyline, you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie.enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done. with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. despite being quite old now, in video game years. it's still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life. even now just thinking about it, i've got the theme song stuck in my head. such a great cast and well-written storyline.the story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself. superbly done, in true bond fashion. which can only be named awesome, completely awesome.i've gotta go throw this game on now. if you haven't played it yet, you're missing out!

don't get me wrong. "goldeneye" was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise. but the series had fallen into a fps rut. enter "everything or nothing", which puts bond in third-person. when i wrote my earlier review for "from russia with love", i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly. even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise, eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv, driving an aston martin, driving a limousine that is wired to explode, commandeering two different types of tanks a la "goldeneye", riding a motorcycle, flying a helicopter, repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires, and free falling after a plummeting damsel. sure, vehicle controls are a little clumsy, but the issue here is the variety.as movie adaptations, "goldeneye" and frwl were all that i could have hoped for. but eon's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure. this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe, shannon elizabeth, heidi klum, and misaki ito. judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q, respectively, and pierce brosnan, while no sean connery, adds credibility to the game's proceedings. all characters resemble the stars, with the disappointing exception of heidi klum, who's in-game model doesn't do the real-life model justice. mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes.the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies. willem defoe's character is a former colleague of christopher walken's baddie from "a view to a kill". richard kiel appears as jaws, the hulking henchman from "the spy who loved me" and "moonraker" in three fight scenes, the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have.single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond. like bond, you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth, with plenty of wall and object cover. unfortunately, unlike frwl, only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging, so bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner, and vice-versa. the game also allows players to go into "bond reflex" mode. while you browse your inventory, everything around you will go into super slo-mo, allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. while this takes some getting used to, eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular "bond moments", such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath, and greatly add to the bond movie feeling.there are 3 available difficulty levels: operative, agent, and double oh. on operative, you can breeze through in a few hours. on agent, a few weeks. on double oh, a few months. the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear. some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints, but when all is said and done, no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie.multi-player, unfortunately, is not as thrilling. "goldeneye" still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game. eon's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond's. a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date. the ending, as with most bond games, is anticlimactic. while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game, the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. also, levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. still, for any serious bond fan, not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films.

this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because: the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good. the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do. this james bond game has a good story to it. the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool. also the graphics in this game pretty good.overall score ********* out of **********

this game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. when i got agent under fire, i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of james bond game. this time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond, william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo, and judi dench as m (forgive me all if i spell it wrong). this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around.i give this a 10/10

gender bender sexes things up a bit for the x-files. this episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an ending that is wanting. gender bender is also the x-files debut for actor nicholas lea, better known as alex krycek. in this episode he plays michael, a man attacked by one of "the kindred". you need to see this episode just to see nic lea's less than spectacular beginning. an interesting thing about the kindred's "power of seduction". when marty does it to his victims, they become turned onto him/her. however, when andrew seduces scully, she only because disoriented and groggy, and does not become attracted to andrew. maybe it's because marty has more experience at it than andrew. this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia. throughout the episode it is so wet, soggy, and muddy, it could not have been that much fun. despite the disappointing ending, gender bender is still a decent episode to view.

okay, that was a pretty damn good episode. much better than the credit it receives.the camera work is splendid. best yet. i love that final shot. the atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the guest cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. what i don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained. why does it change sex? what's the purpose? and they're aliens? what kind? why were they never shown again in the later mythology?i'm giving this episode a high three stars. one of my favorites yet, but the plot holes bother me. still... not gonna let it ruin my entertainment.

gender bender the limerick:a man or a woman? who knows?it turns out that 'it' is both.sleeping in claythen they all went awayin one of their ufos.gender bender is another great season 1 episode. i enjoy this one because the story is the kind where you are never really sure what's gonna happen next. it is entirely original. the teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. i really need to learn my that thumb trick the genderbender heshe does. i really like the atmosphere at the kindred's little village and mulder and scully sneaking around in the middle of the night. its very exciting. this is one of my favorite season 1 episodes in fact. i think the thing i like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and left crop circles. many people see this as a non-mythology related alien episode kind of like "the unnatural" or "space" but i think this could easily be seen as mythology related. maybe the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could appear to look like anyone. huh? anyway i give the episode a 9 out of 10.

this episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending angle.i imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease censors.the story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine acting.(nicholas lea makes his x-files debut though not as agent krycek but as a victim called michael) i especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself.its different but enjoyable.ignore any bad reviews you may hear.watch it for yourself and make judgement then

this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say, "enough already!" of course, it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. eric phillips (don wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to eric to clear her name. wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me. being a pm production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator. it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995.

scanners ii: the new order is just as good as david cronenberg's classic scanners, scanners was made in 1980 and scanners ii in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies. the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing, it wouldn't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first. scanners ii: the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well. the plot to scanners ii: the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge.scanners ii: the new order is a great sequel to david cronenberg's sci-fi classic scanners and should be seen. check this out. 10/10

as b movies go, it was well above average (i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, although i am trying to minimise any such tendency). as sequels usually go, it was utterly fantastic(despite a "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. despite this sometimes tedious tendency, it seemed to work in this particular film, so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original "scanners").the movie was similar in ways to the "superman" series, in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents (who seemed modelled along the same lines as the kents in the "superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-conforming children, adolescents and/or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as "real genius", and (to a more superficial degree) "doctor mordrid" and struck a particularly strong chord.the film had a positive message, and was fun to watch. i found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even profoundly touching at times. these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex(uality, in this case, as the sexual elements were tastefully done) and violence that makes b movies (or shakespearian plays, for that matter!) so much fun to watch!this is a must watch for all comic book, sci-fi, "remote viewing" enthusiasts, and horror fans! with the right exposure in the right circles, the film could develop quite a cult following, along with the original "scanners".

forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films. its influence was felt for more than a decade. however, certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit, and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help. but, the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient,extinct krell civilization and "monsters from the id" hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant "must see" movie. what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible. the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration. i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic.

this was one of those $.50 cent deals of yore---and far more complex than most realize---and it was in color! not only are the effects extraordinary, vs. crap like 'earth vs. the flying saucers'---the real 'killer' is the 'universality of plot'---everything hinges on two principles---the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous-thinking father's desire for his daughter, and the idea of what would happen should a world's tech reach the point where all citizen's desires become manifest.needless to say if everyone we wished dead gets dead, not many, if any left---and that became the fate of the 'forbidden' planet's populace---rather modern, actually. unfortunately the 'gear' of 'the krell'---wasted by ignorance, remains, and 'morpheus', the incestuous father, knows how to access such tech---and does so, to prevent losing his daughter to another. ancient plot, beautifully rendered.and considering its age, it remains a stunning suspense, action, human-emotion classic---and visually very modern---don't pass this one up---it presages all modern sci-fi---and its pscychological content elevates it, beyond any genre---a timeless work---and the soundtract! you will see/hear no pure 'synth' and perfectly syched moog background---a 'not miss'---

this has always been one of my favourite movies, and will always be. over the last few years i have become a 50's / 60's sci-fi freak, trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then. i love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were. the great colours and the sets get me going too. it's a pity when they re-make some of these good old movies; they nearly always stuff it up, - just look at the recent re-do of the day the earth stood still, it's utter garbage!! forbidden planet is one of the benchmark space films of all time, and now they're trying to re-make it too, and i shudder to think what the new one will be like! to my mind, some things, such as fantastic classic movies, should just be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories, and giving people a thrill in the process. once they add all the techno-crap that we have available now, the film just seems to be more dog-meat from the hollywood sausage factory, - nothing special at all. by the way, i notice that the astronauts' uniforms in forbidden planet were also used for "queen of outer space"! that just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then, doesn't it? hey, less money and better films, hmmm....great performances in this movie from leslie nielsen, in a serious role, and anne francis, walter pidgeon (who has always been one of my favourite actors), earl holiman, and of course robby the robot!the special effects are fantastic, and the storyline is not too far-fetched. this is a great sci-fi experience!

forbidden planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema, especially from the 1950s. there was the day the earth stood still and war of the worlds, but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from shakespeare's the tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough. it's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at (though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates), but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don't know we're channeling it.on the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard, if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the b-movies of the period. a ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before. but the only one left is dr. morbis (walter pidgeon) and his daughter, who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead. morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man, and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts, led by the skipper (leslie nielsen), can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on earth.but there's a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship, one by one, every night, even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence, which the invisible something goes through easily. meanwhile, there's some romance possibly between the skipper and alraira, and there's a more pushy vibe from the doctor: you shouldn't have come to the planet to start, and now you need to go. what happens from this is even more fascinating, just on a purely intellectual level, but forbidden planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas. while everyone may remember robbie the robot, and for good reason, perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail, animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of fantasia.the acting from pidgeon is subtle: you wouldn't expect him to be a villain, though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this, and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect. and the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent, from nielsen as a born leader to holliman providing some great comic relief as the cook (who, i should add, helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon robbie provides). and the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too), and the music, done by electronics, is beautiful in its "tones". but ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the b-movie lot. when it's meant to be funny, it's intentionally so and it works. when it's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors. and when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.an inspiration for many other sci-fi films, and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old, it's a classy and entertaining classic.

i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago! living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreamed up by the props department. all in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a 'young' man

certain elements of this film are dated, of course. an all white male crew, for instance. and like most pre-star wars science fiction, it tends to take too long admiring itself.but, still, no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did, even down to the use of the "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots, and was the inspiration for all that followed, from c3po to data.the plot line, of course, is shakespeare's "the tempest". morbius is prospero, and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers... it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.

i've now seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something about it i like!50's us sci-fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch: they were either intelligently made and/or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese. forbidden planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, colour.it also had a head start with the script - although shakespeare might not have recognised it, it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well.it's the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on 200,000 years before. along the way the plot bristles with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you're watching it, but always do. that love triangle thing...yuk! disney's cartoonery still holds up well, and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after 50 years. robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though!all in all, with all faults, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives.

i should say at the outset there are many, many things i love about 'forbidden planet' and yes, i certainly consider it a 'classic' science-fiction film for many reasons. but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion. no less an authority than leonard maltin says 'forbidden planet' "...is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre." ambitious? without a doubt. intelligent? depends on what part of the film you're talking about. it certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point. at a cost of nearly $2 million (this was 1956, remember), mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling, eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before, even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects. 'charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies, yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here. even the dreaded 'monster from the id' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people, unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8. when i see the various sets and take note of the art design, models, costumes, etc., i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz,' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects. so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless. 'forbidden planet' is wonderful to look at. the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated, matte paintings of planets and space in the background, and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth. it's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you'd ever see. the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex, where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible. but then we get to the actors, darn it. the performances are almost uniformly awful, though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor, except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble. even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance, it's lugubrious at times. a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j.j. adams, and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film. he seems to instinctively know, thirty years ahead of time, that his true forte' lay in comedy, as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines. every forced reaction, whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation, looks right out of a high school play. anne francis, also very young, fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta, whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up. (alta morbius, now there's a name for you.) unfortunately, even at this early age, anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in 'butterfield 8.' there is a good story here, buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's 'cookie,' ship's cook. (holliman turns in a horrendous performance too. i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school.) based on shakespeare's 'the tempest,' the story of a dead race, the krell, and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'forbidden planet,' and for good reason. for a few minutes here and there, you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists' conception of the krell underground complex. is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings? you'll have to decide that on your own. oh, and of course there's robby the robot, every 1950's ten-year-old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like. he's funny. in places. so, 'forbidden planet' to me is a very, very mixed bag. it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed, not least of which was 'star trek.' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again.

as did others in this forum, when "fobidden planet" was offered in 1956, i rushed to see it. this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out" all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well. this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as "flash gordon". leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at that time, but walter pigeon, marvin miller, anne francis, richard anderson, earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well. there are so many visual splendors in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes. the approach to altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of the rocket-sled, dr. morbius's house seen from without and from within, the underground complex and its wonders, the setup of the weaponry, the battle with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants. veteran cyril hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline. it can be watched again and again with pleasure--i have been doing so for nearly fifty years. until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes. still the best, many say. that says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imaginations--and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem.

shakespeare's "the tempest" is a model for this exceptional science fiction film. we look for differences. prospero and his daughter, miranda, are stranded on a mediterranean island." morbius and altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star altair. ariel is a spirit. robby the robot is a man-made servant. caliban's evil hardly approaches that of monsters of the id. shakespeare spares prospero. morbius dies when altair 4 blows up. "the tempest" is a comedy. "forbidden planet" is a tragedy. we wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the krell in some future time. anne francis is altaira. jack kelly is lieutentant farman. kelly starred with james garner in the comedy/western tv series, "maverick."

i know i should like this film, and i do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying. it's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well. i also have to say that overall, the movie leaves me cold. it's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. on the plus side the effects are great (besides the cartoon monster), as are the effects, props, costumes and of course robbie. if the robot was not in this film, i don't think it would have been as popular as it was/is. the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the "krell." as many times as i've seen this movie, the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were. based on what was being produced at that time, besides "this island earth," forbidden planet is miles above the average sci-fi movies of the time. being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. certainly a classic in its own right, flaws and all, and deservedly so.

when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show. yet, while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films, the 1950s did have some very good, if not great, science fiction films like the day the earth stood still, the incredible shrinking man, invasion of the body snatchers, war of the worlds, and the thing from another world. yet, the best of the bunch, for its literacy and production values, was undoubtedly mgm's first big foray into a level science fiction, forbidden planet, released in 1956. it was a 98 minute color film, directed by fred m. wilcox, that featured then state of the art special effects, and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume, from a screen treatment called fatal planet, by irving block and allen adler, who adapted aspects of william shakespeare's the tempest into it.the film drew raves when it was released, for its oscar nominated special effects, its all electronic music score, by louis and bebe barron (although credited as electronic tonalities, to avoid music guild fees), vivid matte paintings- inspired by chesley bonestell, and the famed monster of the id (moti), which was animated by an animator, joshua meador, on loan from the walt disney studio. even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot, in his first role in either film or television. later he would appear in the film the invisible boy- included in this dvd as a bonus, as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone, night gallery, and lost in space- with whose own robot he is often confused, and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlins.the tale is simple, but elegantly constructed, and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced 'love story' aspect in the film. in the 23rd century, the united planets cruiser c-57d- a flying saucer, led by commander j.j. adams (leslie nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days), is en route to the planet altair iv, to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon, sent to the planet twenty years earlier. after a year's journey, there they encounter the lone survivor of the party, doctor edward morbius (walter pidgeon), the prospero stand-in- a philologist, his gorgeous blond daughter altaira (anne francis)- the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt, and robby the robot, the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart. morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year, yet he was immune to it. all in all, it's a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings, and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmy's and robby's exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity. yet, it's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures, for it's played straight, thus making it even funnier. as for the main feature? forbidden planet deserves all its kudos. it's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than star wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. only such films like 2001: a space odyssey, solaris, alien and aliens, and the first two terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.it's worth knowing that, despite forbidden planet's 'happy ending', there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta, as well. after all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time. also, the film wisely only 'shows' the moti once, and never shows the krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories. watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. but, even if you don't, there's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping. that alone is timeless.

okay, so robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. and don't get me started about the poster.this is still a great movie, 40 years after it was released. i grew up watching "science fiction" on the local tv station's "science fiction/adventure theater" on sunday afternoons, so i've seen quite a few sf movies from the '50s. at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.i doubt that many sf movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.

level one, horror.when i saw this film for the first time at 10, i knew it would give me nightmares. it did. surprisingly, as i recall, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them.level two, psychoanalytic theory.later as an adult, i saw the story for what it was: what if the savage, unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest.level three, pure science fiction.the best way plausibly to realize the plot's "what if" is through the science fiction genre. this is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that passes for the genre today.after 43 years, forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films. if planning a remake, skg or lucas, watch out!

today's sci-fi thrillers are more like rambo in outer-space with monster special effects (frequently ludicrous such as sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space). though tame by today's standards, the special effects of "forbidden planet" were quite striking for their time. even today, they still hold plausibility. yet, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal. much of what was going on was left up to the imaginations of the audience. (what did the krell creatures look like?) by having much of the framework of the story never divulged or only divulged in the end, the tension and suspense held throughout the movie. the ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying. in my mind, this is still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi films ever made.

there were a lot of 50's sci-fi movies. they were big draws for the drive-in theaters. a lot of them were crappy even back then. this movie and 'the day the earth stood still' stand out, and both have aged well in their own way. from the very beginning with its eerie theremin musical score (which still sounds weird since theremins are hardly ever used) forbidden planet takes you where no man has gone before. speaking of star trek there's so much material in this film that got into star trek tos its like a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain/first mate/doctor, the mad scientist, alien beings, babe in short skirt, computer intelligence; it is all de rigeur now but this was the first of its kind. besides, it has good acting and well-done artwork which even today evokes a certain awe at the imagery. consider how the huge krell machine is successfully depicted with some real depth. i saw this as a kid (at a drive-in :0)when it was a new movie and it scared me. of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but i remember being real worried about the invisible monster. forbidden planet is a movie a sci-fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing.

first off, consider that this film is nearly fifty years old! yet, it still stands up as one of the great films of all time. i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050?the story is simple, yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. i can still recall the first time i watched this, as a kid, when the monster enters the force-field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first (and only) time. had me shivering in fear, i can tell you. looks dated today, but still more than effective enough.the scenes with the tiger show their age now. you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira, but they are only just visible.likewise, the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done.it's also amazing to see leslie nielsen (better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies) as a young, but still mature man. he was 30 when this film came out! nearly 80 now!all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come. timeless.

there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship, stuff he dare not dream about.as doctor edward morbius, pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, anne francis. they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell.the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. the machinery they left behind is still functioning.maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. the terms would change, we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek.we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey. it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one, about mortal beings trying to play god.you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot. this mechanical marvel, put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day. he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space. his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar, but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea. forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b. demille.classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.never miss this one whenever it's broadcast.

i have loved this movie all of my life. it's such an intelligent story also, with plenty of classical allusions. eg. the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon. well, in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. in fp, walter pidgeon is clearly the chimera- himself and his id monster. i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $150m on special effects, but about $1.50 on a screenplay.cheers

forbidden planet rates as landmark in science fiction, carefully staying within "hard" aspects of the genre (science -- not fantasy, ergo nerds will love it) while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary 1950s values. morbius's isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens, a swimming pool, and the ultimate home appliance: robby the robot. "a housewife's dream!" exclaims the captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robot's abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate waste.also revealing to the 1950s: fruedian psychology rears its head in the id explanation, although morbius dismisses it as an outdated concept. there is a touch of the pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the saucer. perhaps most timely is the post-atomic fear that science is the enemy, and arrogant scientists will unwittingly bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledge.yet the suburban drama presented by forbidden planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci-fi genre. they aren't swashbucklers or heroes, but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a serviceman's crudeness and honesty. the good guys drive the flying saucer, and the aliens are so long gone we don't even know what they looked like -- although their music er-"atmospheric tonalities" by bebe and louis barron are remarkably futuristic today. the views from morbius' house are truly alien with jagged cliffs and pink bonsais. the interior of the saucer is just this side of buck rogers. there's a lot visually to like. although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the kiddies, forbidden planet is a cerebral movie, slow paced and talky. it is working on many levels at once: hard sci-fi against space adventure, philosophical against domestic. there are many suburban touches. in spite of all their space-talk, the soldiers are dressed for the golf course. morbius' fatal discovery is a humble educational facility, a schoolhouse. the most interesting character is morbius' daughter altaira. having never seen a man she is unashamedly forward to the crew. she's a post-madonna teen who designs her own space-age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits -- imagine christina aguilera with a household replicator. men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a minidress, but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress. anne francis deserves better recognition for humiliating the leut with kisses. alas we'll never know if she was "working" him as he suspects, since the captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for her attention. she is the character who makes the important change in the film. shocked that her father compares the dead doc to the other "embeciles" in his landing party, she turns away from her father, her home, to leave with the sailors for earth. it's this act of defiance, of maturity, that sends morbius' id creature over the edge, allegorically destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the krell. maybe the krell had teenage daughters too...?

if you like star wars/trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times, other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. the intensity of the root material (shakespeare's "the tempest") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later lucas). and just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up. this was the first movie where you couldn't. miracle it was made at "a-movie" scale, economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it. and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was "lassie come home". until i looked him up, i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a "b" genre back then. this was either a very very visionary production, or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood.there are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively. there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; "computers", as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. star trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later. and if the trek/wars technobabble turns you off, fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today. the "ship" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done, for tv or film. we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked.if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching fp will explain all that. it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars'.

the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot. my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci-fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for. how wrong i was. big studio, big budget and big production values make this a strong contender, at least visually, for the best sci-fi film coming out of the era. i qualify with the word visually, because "war of the worlds" is a lot darker and scarier than "forbidden planet", and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory.what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography, followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr. morbius' (walter pidgeon) home and laboratory. but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake, the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold. it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say, that of "star wars". which made me consider, audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with sw, or in 1986 with "aliens". watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect, and i'm fairly resistant to hyperbole.it's not too much of a stretch to imagine "forbidden planet" as a direct antecedent of the 'star trek' tv series; gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show. followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'star trek'. i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c57-v headed for a transporter room, while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series.where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the id'. that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for 1956, when every other sci-fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures. the film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams (leslie nielsen) explained it.you know, looking at the calendar, the year 2200 isn't that far off. this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets. i think though, that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby.

a flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet.' what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.on the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. some compare it to shakespeare's tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its the tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek.anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. the special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. if it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.this is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi i like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. the clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek, lost in space, and even farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek's original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. while i do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it. some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles. unfortunately, nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). walter pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. ms francis, earl holliman, and the amazing robby the robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. the problems with the featured performances, i think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. though they certainly got most of the film quite right.

this is a film that has it all, the dashing hero, the beautiful damsel in distress, the noble figure with the tragic flaw, and a truly wonderful robot. forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn't lose its flavor with repeated viewings (although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score).movie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams, although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role. the distinguished and noble-looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret (id). other supporting cast deserve a nod, especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful "doc", and of course the charms of miss francis, as noted above.this film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, no less. the credits call them "tonalities", but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the "theremin" device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track. still, it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krell.the special effects are also quite arresting. i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible "id" monster, and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe. the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways, guided by the enigmatic dr. morbius.i recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr. morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot. the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters. viewers of follow-on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes, although i recall he never had the "personality" of the original robby.i must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves, through force of will, to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes. although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately overlooked) by dr. morbius until pointed out by the clear-thinking commander adams, who forces dr. morbius to confront the evil within himself. it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr. morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect, which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine: "here. here is where your mind was artificially enlarged. consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine. but your subconscious had been made strong enough." zowee!forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci-fi film ever, and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen.

a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some of the acting, outdated dialogue etc.first, there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, now all dead, who were 1 million years more advanced than earth humans(us), and their technology, particularly the 8,000 cubic mile machine.second, there is the music and sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. it creates an eerie, unearthly feeling, unlike "2001", which had traditional classical music.third, its "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned, it's also based on real science and doesn't break the laws of physics and biology.finally, and most importantly, forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and, more incredibly, succeeds in making an honest, intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human (or any other biological entity's) development, no matter how long we survive as a species.in other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.

sure star wars (a movie i have seen at least fifty times) beats all the others in special effects, but this film has every thing else!it has horror(non-graphical), romance, robots, witty repartee, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects, and drama.i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print, and i was amazed at how well it held up today. i thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey, but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne.ann francis in here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me.the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me.of course we all know that the "great bird of the galaxy" probably modeled much of "star trek" from this movie.no one has yet to beat robby, the robot, in terms of personality(sorry, r2d2 and c3po).this movie, overall, is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to!honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles.

i first saw this movie when it originally came out. i was about 9 yrs. old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie i had seen up until that time.basic plot: an expedition is sent out from earth to the fourth planet of altair, a great mainsequence star in constellation aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since.theme: an inferior civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remains of a greatly advanced alien civilization, the krell-200,000 years removed. the "seed" of destruction from one civilization is being passed on to another, unknowingly at first. the theme of this movie is very much good vs. evil.i first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally. i was just a boy and the tiger scenes really did scare me as did the battle scenes with the unseen creature-force. i was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie.what really captures my attention as an adult though is the truth of the movie "forbidden knowledge" and how relevant this will be when we do (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (alien) civilization far more developed than we ourselves are presently. advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand. we must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. this is, in my opinion, the great moral of the movie.i learned in graduate school that "knowledge is power" is at best, in fact, not correct! knowledge is "potential" power depending upon how it is applied (... if it is applied at all.) [it's not what you know, but how you use what you know!]the overall impact of this movie may well be realized sometime in mankind's own future. that is knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we must, must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to truly control our own destiny or we will end up like the krell in the movie-just winked-out.many thanks to those who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very much appreciated!! i hope you are as entertained by this story as much as i have been over the past 40+ years ....rating: 10 out 10 stars

i am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas. even star wars which is visually brilliant, has one of its central images, a futuristic "gang that couldn't shoot straight." imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons, most of them having an open shot, and they miss.i have read much science fiction, and wish there were more movies for the thinking person. forbidden planet, one of the earliest of the genre, is still one of the very best. the story is based on a long extinct civilization, the krell, who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps. unfortunately, what they hadn't bargained for, is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual. the primitive aspect of the brain, the id, as freud called it, is allowed to go unchecked. it is released in sleep, a bad dream come to corporeal existence. walter pigeon, dr. morbius, is the one who has jacked his brain to this level, and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind. his thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend. the krell, a much superior species, could not stop it; it destroyed them. the landing party has never been of great interest to me. the rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable. ann francis is beautiful and naive, and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male. her father's ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties' astronauts (for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts). they are always trying to figure out "dames." the cook is a great character, with his obsession for hooch. robbie the robot has much more personality than most of the crew, and one wonders if mr. spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature. the whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star. morbius can't turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him. there are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once; this is one that can coast right into the 21st century.

forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . as soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . we meet the unforgetable robbie , the mysterious dr morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - the krell who died out overnight . or did they ? you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron`s electronic music adds even more atmosphere i`m shocked this film isn`t in the top 250 imdb films .

i love this tv series so much. it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. i cant believe that they cut it off tv, and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but i'm not sure. cybersix was by far the best tv show ever. i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it. i luved it so much <3 its about a women by the name of cybersix, she is not human. she goes by adrian sieldman, a man teacher at a highschool. now cybersix is actually a women, she is just disguised as a man in the day. by night cybersix patrols the city.a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix, and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her.if u have never watched it before u should totally download it. it was the best tv show in the world. why did they cut it off???? some people have issues. but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes.

there be very little doubt that hg wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century . jules verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices . wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales . perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including richard dawkins consider it a near certainty . there's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was wells who introduced this to human thinking ? undoubtedly it was wells that planted the seed .things to come was adapted by wells himself from his own novel . it is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays . the dialouge is often laden , heavy handed and unconvincing . one case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war " why must we murder one another . why ? " this mirrors the criticism , near naked contempt that orwell had of wells in his essay wells , hitler and the world state and it is true that wells anti-war message is painfully overstated . it'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an raf pilot and his opposite number in the luftwaffe a few years later that said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation . there's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of the wanderng sickness is wonderfully realised . even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature it's the images that makes this film along with arthur bliss score that makes the film so memorable . and to be fair wells does ask the question " the universe or nothing . what shall it be ? " . in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive

things to come is an historic film. along with metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles. it is also one of the first doomsday movies. it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year, and even, in a subtle way, the year it would end in the real world. but then the film departs from reality, depicting a world ravaged by war (only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936).the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight, making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre. it is sad that, after things to come, sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies, a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001:a space odyssey more than 30 years later. if they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film, things would have been very different in hollywood. raymond massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film, to good effect. massey plays a great "doctor who"-like role as a pilot from an advanced (for 1970) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by ralph richardson). ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. but that's a big problem with this film -- there really isn't a cohesive storyline.perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of intolerance, actually -- it's hard to have a conventional plot, but i felt more could have been made of the material, and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission ... the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting. maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation: a sequel?things to come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once. unlike metropolis, however, it might not bear repeated viewings.

this was the most costly film, when produced. sir alexander korda and h.g. wells were both distressed by its poor ratings---for good reason. it was and remains far ahead of its time. aside from the seemingly poor direction, probably editing, at the very beginning, the work moves along to a stunning conclusion.whether its sir ralph richardson's 'boss' role, or even better, his wife's, sir cedric's, as adversary to space-faring, raymond massey's 'john cabal' center role---all deliver mind-boggling performances.the scene with mr. korda's incomparable set, of the small girl-child, running out to an absolutely 'never-to-be-matched' scene, commenting 'life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier'? that swiftly brings tears to any parent/grandparent. this is not a film for the young--unless 'experienced' and rather those who have seen 'the horror' it opposes.sure, the 'phony-parachuting', looks hokey---while using a 'magnetic-cannon', now termed 'mass-driver' may be viewed as ridiculous, vs. rockets---give sir korda a break--mr. wells made that choice. and at +/- $8 million, this film went way beyond 'over-budget'---so he concentrated on what he could manage.the true power of this greatest of cinema rests in 'john cabal's' final statement of human destiny---his friend 'passworthy' doubts the wisdom of space-faring, saying, 'we're such little animals.' john cabal's proper response is,(paraphrased) 'yes, little animals, and if that is all we are, we must live and die as such.' they are standing under a large astronomical telescope. he sweeps his hand over the night sky. 'yet we may have all the universe, or nothing.'---then the final chorus breaks in---'which shall it be?'---this is not 'star wars', 'blade runner'---anything you may consider 'great'---this is the real thing.i remind all of steven hawking's most recent address, upon his latest 'medal of honor'---'humanity must leave earth, or die.'---the very core of this work---i love 'standard entertainment'---yet this 'relic', for the wise viewer, offers far more. 'which shall it be?' be in the proper 'mood'---whatever that takes---this will take your breath away---i 'guarontee'---overall, for humanity? the most significant of cinema. since posting, i note many have commented on the poor 'media-quality' of 'surviving' examples. in the 80's i developed a 'proprietary' 'colorization' process which required a 'clean' original. this led me to michael korda, who sadly noted all were gone---so we must relish what remains---'sad but true?'

this is an amazing movie from 1936. although the first hour isn't very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it. however, don't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accents (it's american - but "1930s" american) make it difficult.basically, the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called "everytown". it spans from 1936, when a war is on the horizon, to 2036, when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems.the first one hour is a bit slow - although it's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought. the events, suspense and visuals are pretty low-key in today's terms. however, when it gets to the future, it's just plain fun to watch. the large sets and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat.unless you have great listening abilities, this movie is hard to listen to. i think i understood only 80% of the dialog. it could use closed-captioning.if you're a sci-fi fan, this is one of the genre's classics and is a must see (well, at least after the first hour). for the average viewer, wait until there's a closed caption version and then watch it if you're comfortable with movies of this time period.

synopsis the future as seen from 1939 england. as war loomed over europe, the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past. it is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes.concept in relation to the viewer beware your leaders and what you are told. thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. there will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope.pros and cons i had seen this film long ago and recently downloaded it off of the internet (it is in the public domain). this is a fascinating work on numerous levels. since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939, it has obvious flaws. this vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical. this film was cutting edge for its day. the special effects are very good as is the story line. the acting suffers a bit in the british theatrical sense, in that it can lean a bit toward shakespeare.one of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know is not always true. the films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us.the underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film. the set design and wardrobe of "forbidden planet", the failings of technology in "2001: a space odessy", even the lush landscapes / cityscapes of "star wars" owe some amount of inspiration to this film.the ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed. while it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars, we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it. even as we reach, there are those that are trying to hold us back. this films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards. huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step.many great british actors are in this film as young men. cedric hardwicke and ralph richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here. raymond massey is a curious choice to play the lead character, cabel. his character almost comes across as the new christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science.this is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark.

this movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century, but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys, chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society, specifically when that technology is used for warfare.this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology, but as the circle completes itself, familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology.brilliant for it's time, the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some, but as a landmark in the history, development, and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must. in the end, free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed, the state ofsociety itself, as shaped by world events.those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so, but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains, as this film posits.as far as qualifying as sci-fi, one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it's speculative nature. it asks us the questions, what if these events happened this way, and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it? how would we react?as far as influence, this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions.

with such actors as ralph richardson, raymond massey, cedrick hardwicke, and margaretta scott, how can you go wrong. very unusual scenics, especially the modern ones. the realization of the modern machinery is very effective. here you have ray-gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area, so new structures can be made. although she's much younger in this film, it's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs. pumphrey from the bbc series, all creatures great and small is going to be! really effective "reappearance" of both raymond massey and ralph richardson. the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer, artur honegger and it is also unusual. for the time (1936) it looks like they used really, large sets or the effects make it seem that way. lastly, it's a really good story.

i have, "things to come," on d.v.d. and it's very clear compared to my vhs version. the audio is fair, but can be hard to understand at times. i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it.it gave details of why some things happened. the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first. such as, john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party, like it was a dive bomber, out dateing sea power by naming a battleship,"dinosuar." ships sunk by air-power, an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes. swept flying wing planes. strong rolls for the women through the entire movie. there are more, see the movie to enjoy them.

h.g. wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in 1935.very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades.great cast includes;raymond massey(arsenic and old lace) sir cedric hardwick(ghost of frankenstein)ralph richardson(time bandits) and margaretta scott.early glimpses of helicopters,holograms,a rocket ship,and futuristic cities.this film was ahead of its time.directed by william cameron menzies(invaders from mars)its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis(1927)but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come,that was made in 1979. this movie has nothing to do with the original.h.g. wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his stories.a classic science fiction movie.10 out of 10

amazing effects for a movie of this time. a primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of itself.a wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive.org. no charge, no sign up necessary. watch it in one sitting and you will be propelled.i plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as i had never heard of it before and i am a hard core sci fi fan.i would like to see how others react to this movie.watch it.rate it.tell us what you think.

things to come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's utopian ideals.raymond massey, cedric hardwicke, and ralph richardson make up a fine cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. there are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. however, there are some profound words there. is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? the film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. sure, hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. for the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. it has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema. they are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. there is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. these films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.

geniuses william cameron menzies and herbert george wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film, with ambition and scope hard to find today. they predict world war ii and the way great britain was attacked, and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. they change the timing; in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it's amazing. we even see an helicopter (the film is older than them).unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem romans with bubble-helmets: if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s, well's vision of a rationalistic society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and john cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it.9 1/2 out of 10. inspiring like that final monologue by john cabal.

this sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936. visually it is a wonder to behold, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress.this gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times.raymond massey and cedric hardwicke,both great actors,come off as quite a pair of fanatics. ralph richardson is very good as the "the boss" a megalomaniac warlord. the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. i'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie. there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes. although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be,this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it.

if scientists behaved in a way that h.g. wells was confident they would in the future, history wouldn't quite have turned out the way it did in things to come. were almost 80 years past the point that wells wrote the shape of things to come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before, in some ways farther away.though such well known players as raymond massey, ralph richardson, and cedric hardwicke are in the cast, they're more caricatures than real characters. it's the main weakness with the film, it's devoted to wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools.massey's characters, two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view. cedric hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward. and ralph richardson is a warlord arisen from the destruction of another thirty years war fought with modern weapons. by the way as the atomic bomb had not been invented, poison gas was deemed to be weapon that almost destroys mankind.according to wells, science and conquest can never mix. scientists as a group are far too above the world of politics to engage in such things. in wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of hitler and mussolini. those same folks however in order to defeat them, subordinated themselves to the allies and fashioned the atomic weapons that ushered in the modern age. if they behaved as wells would have liked them to, someone like albert einstein would have headed a junta of scientists who would have established a new order after world war ii. wells got it wrong both in time and in development. he apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power. computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment. still things to come, aided by the direction of william cameron menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of h.g. wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time though he didn't quite get right the shape of things to come.

the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians. the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources. it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement. it depicts a space gun/launcher and a helicopter, along with inventive mass communication devices, elevators, flat screen panels, and wireless intercoms. it's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future. but it portrays a child-like vision of boundless scientific/technological investigation.to me, it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozean-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government. the pro-progress characters (such as the two cabals) believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations, always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants.arthur c. clarke (author of 2001: a space odyssey) suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie. kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarke's suggestions (source: clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies. it has a beautiful menzies art design, but mediocre special effects (esp. the toy tanks).i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity. it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time. it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster. but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths. it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness:cabal: "too much {rest} and too soon, and we call it death. but for man no rest and no ending. he must go on--conquest beyond conquest. this little planet and its winds and ways, and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. then the planets about him, and at last out across immensity to the stars. and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time--still he will be beginning." cabal: "if we are no more than animals--we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass, mattering no more--than all the other animals do--or have done." {he points out at the stars.} "it is that--or this? all the universe--or nothingness..." (quotes from screenplay).if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress, then the council members (of the world government) will seem like technocrats. but actually those "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely, and they would have to be suppressed by government bans, laws against science and experiment, and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants.in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology, so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment. the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though, only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress.so it's also a story about the freedom to do science, just as much as it's about the wonders of progress. many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises, except in cases of social bias (many want to ban cloning, for example) or naturalism (some don't want us to progress freely, and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth) or fear/reason (some believe we aren't ready for advanced science/technology since we might destroy ourselves). but cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the problem of danger: "our {scientific} revolution did not abolish death or danger. it simply made death and danger worth while" (screenplay).

h.g. wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by. he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour. at the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species, natural biology, on one side, and marxism, market economy on the other side, were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number. the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite. he defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race. first of all the non-caucasian, with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages. then, within the caucasian community all those who were not healthy, the alcoholics, the mentally disabled, all those who were genetically disabled, etc. that was not hitler. that was h.g. wells and that was not after the first world war. that was more than ten years before. and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that defended the idea that the human "race", left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth, would see the differentiation of the human "race" into two "species": the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species. the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators. wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy. the first countries to follow this injunction were the scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them. the film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election, no parliament, no really democratic institution, only peace imposed by military conquest, and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors. and in that future world all, absolutely all human beings are caucasians. wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036. amazing. wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all. the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets. frightening. and that was produced in 1936. all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of hitlerism, fascism, japanese imperialism or stalinism can be found. but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h.g. wells. we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute "democratic" social selection, or the animal farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat, or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of big brother. this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others. and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days. it would be unfair to go beyond. this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals: the fear that the future would only be somber, bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

i first saw this film 40 years ago on n.y. television, and thought it was a depressing look at the future. wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing. (" no private airplanes". the 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to british film goers doing the war. the concept of the future, and the korda an co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film. the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss. a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series. it is interesting to note that the boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time churchill.

saw it first in 1975 on some german tv channel and was hooked immediately, afterwards i saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays i have a videotape which i watch at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every aspect (direction, acting, cut, musical score...). the sets are outstanding and very impressive, the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "everytown" is pure mussolini and raymond massey is just charming, believable and ideally cast as "the hero". the positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes, even after watching the film so many times.this movie is good on tv but it was made for the big screen, so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema. please do, it's overwhelming.

i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed, with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax. what cinema goers made of this in the 30s, i can only imagine. the 'times' said at the time, 'a miracle has come to the screen.' watch it and marvel.

things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows an imagined world, or "everytown" through 100 years. you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the "boss" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again, after everytown was bombed and war broke out.this film only has about 3 faults: it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren't deep at all, and the overall plot isn't altogether solid. the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on... it just seems a little "fluffy." but if you love sci-fi and are interested in what h.g. wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.

the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. when war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed. adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the "wandering sickness", a pestilence that continues for another four years."things to come" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. the "wings over the world" concept plays out a bit corny, though it's spokesman cabal (raymond massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. if he fails, others will follow. this message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in massey's end of movie speech. man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an "all the universe or nothing" mindset.the film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film "metropolis". as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969."things to come" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? it's not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.

i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year. i was enthralled and entertained. it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci-fi story, in a book or on the screen. there's social commentary, speculation, and a good story.there's something eerie, and amusing, watching a 1936 view of the 'distant future' of the 60s and 70s.i think it's a must see, and not only for sci-fiers.

"things to come" movie review by kwricehere is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place. it is a film i've only seen in truncated parts, but art should be taken as a whole. i experienced this film as it was designed, in a darkened theatre, on a silver screen, with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with. that audience and myself were effected by this film! one woman who lived through ww ii was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive, albeit corny, ending.the things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits. the first thing we see is "h.g. wells" in bold angular block copy much like the "superman" of yore. it is not the film title, but the creator's title, and then before any other humans, such as actors or production, are listed, the director william cameron menzies is up there! who? you've probably seen his work before, "around the world in 80 days," "pride of the yankees," and "gone with the wind." he did not direct after this sci-fi epic opera he and mr. wells created, but his film imagery, sets, and design are very recognizable.that imagery is very effecting. i recognized images from many other films, that have paid homage to this classic. the recent "hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy" is obvious, along with bugs bunny, "fantasia," "monty python and the holy grail," "sky captain & the world of tomorrow," "night of the living dead" and more that i know of, but which titles escape me. this is real special effects here, scenes now done with cgi are done with actors, big sets, and detailed models. this film was made in 1936, and it's obvious it meant something to the other auteurs. wells and menzies also worked with bliss, doing the music, and korda, the producer, to create a masterpiece with message, warning, and sermon.the lines the shakespearean actors cedric hardwicke, ralph richardson and raymond massey speak, sometimes sound preachy, but i also heard lines i still hear now. "these toys children have nowadays are nothing like i had when i was child," "it'll help develop their coordination," "what do we need books for, what do we need to read for?", "we don't need cars, there's nowhere to go, we have all we need right here," "there will be no war." but war there is! the naive citizens of "everytown" refuse to see the literal writing on the wall. the never-ending war explodes christmas eve. the little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me. this is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to hitler's appeasement. this war does not end. the poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act.it is another dark age. no government, no services, and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about. plague, warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists. loved ones are shot in the street, before they can carry the plague to another. midway there is a marvelous vignette about the rolls royce, that is a much needed respite mid-way. into this lands a futuristic plane that heralds the future.that future is the third act. the world has rebuilt itself with the help of that "puny animal, man." helicopters fly in this film, before they were even invented. the plumber's helper has other uses than the dalek's or glenn miller's. wide screen plasma screens beguiling the masses, and orators inciting the people to tear it all down. "beware the concussion, you have been warned!", the city father warns the riotous populace. so be warned, this film might hit you like it hit me. there are some cute miscues and miscalculations, but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again, and i do want to see this artful film again. others criticize mr. wells vision. it is very easy to work with 20/20 hindsight regarding things, costumes and foley miscues. i believe mr. wells' "things to come" is not about things, but is actually about concepts, social trends, and philosophical ideals. besides, we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come. this is not cheap cardboard british science fiction, but worthwhile epic filmed opera, sans singing, that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings.

aside from the great movie metropolis, this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie. while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad, it is a great film for two reasons. first, it is extremely original in both style and content. even in the 21st century, there are no films i can think of that are anything like it. second, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible--using matte paintings, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. sure, you could sit back and knock the film because, by today's standards, the effects are only so-so. but, you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences. in many ways, the sets look highly reminiscent of the "modern cities" featured at the 1939 world's fair.i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question "are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness?" the end result seems to be a little of both! how true!a final note: i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video. all three times the sound and print quality stank--particularly the sound. if this is available on a dvd, hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning. as the sound on the video kept cutting out, i really would have appreciated this!

things to come is that rarity of rarities, a film about ideas. many films present a vision of the future, but few attempt to show us how that future came about. the first part of the film, when war comes to everytown, is short but powerful. (ironically, film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england--appeasement was at its height. wells' prediction was borne out all too soon.) the montage of endless war that follows, while marred by sub-par model work, is most effective. the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design. the art director was the great william cameron menzies, and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work. margaretta scott is very seductive as the chief's mistress. the everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling--perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970. unfortunately, the model work, representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways, is laughably bad and could have been done much better, even with 30s technology. this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing. this is redeemed by raymond massey's magnificent speech that concludes the film--rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well. massey's final question is more relevant now than ever, in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight. the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss, whose last name i proudly share.unfortunately, the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film.

i must admit a slight disappointment with this film; i had read a lot about how spectacular it was, yet the actual futuristic sequences, the age of science, take up a very small amount of the film. the sets and are excellent when we get to them, and there are some startling images, but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards...much the best drama of the piece is in the mid-section, and then it plays as melodrama, arising from the 'high concept' science-fiction nature of it all, and insufficiently robust dialogue. there is far more human life in this part though, with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator, the "boss" of the everytown. i loved richardson's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines, dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey's aloof, confident visitor. this boss is a posturing, convincingly deluded figure, unable to realise the small-fry nature of his kingdom... it's not a great role, yet richardson makes a lot of it.everytown itself is presumably meant to be england, or at least an english town fairly representative of england. interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things; the 'things to come' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal, but to just go on and on. there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section, concerning more personal 'life', yet one is left quite unsatisfied. the film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities; it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle, blunt moralism, every time. and, of course, recall the hedged-bet finale: raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are! concerning the question of the film being a prediction: i must say it's not at all bad as such, considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right. the grander conceptions have something to them; a war in 1940, well that was perhaps predictable... lasting nearly 30 years, mind!? a nuclear bomb - the "super gun" or some such contraption - in 2036... a technocratic socialist "we don't believe in independent nation states"-type government, in britain, after 1970... hmmm, sadly nowhere near on that one, chaps! ;-) no real politics are gone into here which is a shame; all that surfaces is a very laudable anti-war sentiment. generally, it is assumed that dictatorship - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist, as under the boss, or all-hands-to-the-pump scientific socialism - will *be the deal*, and these implications are not broached... while we must remember that in 1936, there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out - or even how they were turning out - the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers' vision on other matters.much of the earlier stuff should - and could - have been cut in my opinion; only the briefest stuff from '1940' would have been necessary, yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous, and it is ages before we get to the richardson-massey parts. i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott; who is just a trifle sceptical, cutting a flashing-eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose. the character is not explored, or frankly explained or exploited, except for one scene which i shall not spoil, and her relationship with the boss isn't explored; but then this was the 1930s, and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then. edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles; more so in the first as a hapless chap, praying for war, only to be bluntly put down by another massey character. massey himself helps things a lot, playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto, contrasting well with a largely diffident cast, save for richardson, and scott and chapman, slightly.i would say that "things to come" is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936; one of the few serious british science fiction films to date, indeed! its set (piece) design and harnessing of resources are ravenous, marvellous. yet, the script is ultimately over-earnest and, at times, all over the place. the direction is prone to a flatness, though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion. the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however; respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology, and an engaging, jerky performance that consistently beguiles. such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing; powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this - they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers, great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate."things to come", as it stands, is an intriguing oddity, well worth perusing, yet far short of a "metropolis"... 'tis much as "silly", in wells' words, as that lang film, yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it.

while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind, this is still a stunning film that presages the science-fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen. it predicts the global chaos of wwii, but expands on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years, and then tells the epic tale of man's struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space. the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile, but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie's release, and which still impress today. this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre.

i first saw this as a child living in east london. the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street. i remember having nightmares after seeing it. the odd thing is, it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction. apart from a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was badly awry, more nano-technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-crafted work. it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then. i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. however, much was right. mans desire for war, mans inhumanity to man. the means of war as a catalyst for development. 

this early sci-fi masterwork by herbert george wells with music by arthur bliss is a powerful piece of film-making. adapted from wells' somewhat different work by the author, it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of 'peace'. the structure is that after a contrasted-pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war, the script allows the war to happen. two families, the cabells and the passworthys disagree about what may happen; passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization's "automatic" progress; cabell is the thinker, the doubter. their city everytown--obviously london-- becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks, a magnificent war march by bliss, and the end of civilization. the second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a "boss", played with bravura by ralph richardson, whose woman, lovely margaretta scott, is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete-bound dictator type. he is trying to rebuild old wwi airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom; a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes--etc.--everlastingly; this is wells' comment on war versus progress. the survivors are subject to a plague called "the wandering sickness" also. enter a modern flying machine piloted by the cabell of the first section of the film, now part of wings over the world, an international scientists' coalition, who are planning to end warfare forever. this flight-suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the boss and his woman, their attraction being evident; then boss sends up his aircraft against them, the scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the "gas of peace" onto the ruins of everytown. only the boss dies, fighting too hard against the pacifying. the film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers. in section three, a future cabell argues with a future passworthy over the morality of human science. passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the moon; cabell champions man's right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons. the son of passworthy and cabell's daughter, are the astronauts being sent. theotocopulos, a religious-minded luddite, makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city's forum and leads an attack on the 'space gun' that is to fire the new rocket free of earth's gravity. the climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully; the denouement and ending is a speech by cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned. "it is all the universe--or nothing!" cabell tells passworthy. "which shall it be?" as cabell, raymond massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance; he is thoughtful, compassionate, and reasonable, a true scientist. as the rabble-rouser who wants to end the age of science, cedric hardwicke is perfect and powerful. edward chapman playing passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear. the storyline is logical, frequently beautiful and always interesting. given the near-extinction of mankind, the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer. this is a triumph for the director, william cameron menzies, for bliss and for all concerned. listen to the dialogue with someone you love; within its constructed limits, this is a thinking man's drama debating two possible human futures--progress or its reactionary opposite.

robert urich was a fine actor, and he makes this tv movie believable. i remember watching this film when i was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich californian town. urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family, and i love the halloween space suit idea, brilliant. this film is about the battle of one's sprit. tv quality, that exceeds, the big budget, gangs of new york. i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie? i hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.

everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in, as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. but no paradise would be complete without its snake. strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly holds secrets. the father is not a joiner, but pressure is on him to join, as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members. robert urich's good guy part is a bit tepid, but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles. suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson. look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet. the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for. i have seen this movie quite a few times.

a classy film pulled in 2 directions. to its advantage it is directed by wes craven. on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget. it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club. his latest invention, a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood. anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci. her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later. the actor, scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine. lucci and barbara steele's portrait in 'black sunday' were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae. probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine. so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film.

better than the typical made-for-tv movie, invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting (urich, lucci, cassidy, mccarthy, pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto, soleil moon-frye) and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot. urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles. kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live, the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10

when the scientist and family man matt winslow (robert urich) finally accepts the invitation to work the micro-digitech corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife patricia (joanna cassidy) and their son robbie (barret oliver) and daughter chrissy (soleil moon frye) to a huge modern house in the corporation compound. they meet their friend tom peterson (joe regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle, and tom invites the winslow family to join the steaming springs country club. tom tries to seduce matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in micro-digitech, but matt is not tempted with the offer. later he is introduced to the director of the club, jessica jones (susan lucci) that befriends patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about jessica and the members.in the 80's, when i saw "invitation to hell", i liked this movie that partially recalls "the stepford wives", with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound. i have just seen it today, and i found a great metaphoric message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries. i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story, but i believe it fits perfectly. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "convite para o inferno" ("invitation to hell")

robot jox doesn't suffer from story or bad effects. i mean, this was 1990 if you know what i'm talking about. robocop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s. if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time. it wasn't until terminator 2: judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized, and story boarders began to use that motive. but you'll have fond memories of transformers, gundam wing, even power rangers, if you watch this film. the enemy robot is very menacing. it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back-up plan. and there are some great moments within this film. a traitor/spy is working within their midsts. who you think is on your side, backing you up all the way, could be the person you didn't expect him/her to be. and that's very troublesome to think so, don't you agree?

yep, you read that right, kids. michael bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped, overlong, overly pointless "transformers" movies. "robot jox" is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the "transformers" crew spent on megan fox's personal trainer.thankfully, this little robotic gem, initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert band's empire pictures studio, seems to have developed a cult following over the years. i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold war-era politics/stereotypes were already out of date by that time (just the bands' luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released, eh?), it's still a pretty damn cool little b-movie. they really don't make'em like this anymore, or if they do, they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportions.for those who are unfamiliar, here's the robo-scoop: we're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust, large scale "wars" have been outlawed. disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano (or perhaps that should be machine-o-machine-o) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots. whichever 'bot walks away from the fight wins for "his" side. gary graham (who would later go on to play detective sykes in the "alien nation" tv series), plays "achilles," the greatest robot jock in marketplace (a.k.a. the good guys) history. achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts (ten being the maximum number of battles before a "jock" is retired) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the "confederation" (i.e. the russkies!), the psychotic alexander (who is the most over the top "evil russian" stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgren's infamous turn as ivan drago in "rocky iv"). the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles, but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain. a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout, but achilles simply wants to bow out, hang up his helmet and move on with his life. rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more, i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns, behind the scenes skullduggery, and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow "jox" before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale.i hope i'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction, because it isn't. "robot jox" is just plain fun. i'll grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average b-grade sci-fi movie, and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known (especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery), it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empire/full moon pictures factory. the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques, and the sets and costumes don't look half-assed in the slightest. empire pictures and director stuart ("re-animator") gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture. unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them (or the studio) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal. bottom line: if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours, feel free to rent a "transformers" movie. by the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game. if you want to have a rock'em, sock'em robot good time, pick up robot jox instead.

from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life. the idea of two giant robots, manned by brilliant humans, fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced. i can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script. let's just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures , combined. the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is.....robot jox.

after seeing this excellent film over 100 times, i still find new things that blow me away with this movie, great special effects, incredible acting, and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism, and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well. best movie ever!!!

the one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. not only a movie but an incredible future vision, this movie establishes a new standard of s/f movies. hail and kill!

hrm-i think that line was from the old movie posters.this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator. here's a tip: any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading "in the future..." is going to be fun. this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you.in this case, "in the future..." means that, instead of fighting wars, nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine, well, that's never terribly clear, but it's probably something really important. there are good guys (obviously capitalists, i.e. "us") and bad guys (commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots.sadly, the effects budget was pretty slim, so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots. there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. the space fight is especially nice, as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget.with said money now spent, the climactic fight degenerates into (and i'm not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. i can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.like i said-it's dumb. that's why i bought the tape.

the scenes are fast-paced. the characters are great. i love anne-marie johnson's acting. i really like the ending. however, i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship. it only blossomed when they kissed each other.

what a master piece. to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future. this film is satire of the highest order. in my humble opinion it outranks dr. strangelove.the clever naming of the two superpowers, as the confederation and the market. cons being commies and market, the west! outstanding. the clever use of gen joxs, was ahead of its time. only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering. robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989.the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government. this movies screams don't do it you fools you'll kill us all.excellent 10/10

note to previous reviewer: this movie is "science-fiction adaptation of the iliad" according to the screenwriter. so whether the references are painful or not, no apologies, it is the basis for the film. they admit they stole...though adapted is the p.c. term.great flick but too short. probably didn't come out as well as the author, director, or studio wanted, but pretty damn fun. the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy.a big-budget remake wouldn't be as fun, and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice. but it's fun to dream about the potential there. a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players. i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out. for now, i live with the vhs incarnation.

ok, this movie was cool. i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. judgment is victory for robot jox.

robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age. you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts. so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it.

one of the best movies out there. yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. something different from the usual movies and great fun. one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while. the sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the film. this movie is very hard to find on dvd, but also on vhs. check it out cause i have loved it since it came out. not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. take a look and think like a child. it's a great view and very fun.

my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots. so i try to seek out movies that have robots. and this movie has robots. big ones. they beat the clang and bang out of each other, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. it's really cool. you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. it is very hard to dislike this movie. because of those big robots. they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! it made my girlfriend smile. and that is good enough for me. and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo: as the maniacal russian villain, whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste "like blood" (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-bela lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation.

what a great film it is. the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky. the ending is not just a fitting one, it's more inspirational.but i am intrigued by the characters. it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and athena's fear for achilles's safety. their romance is very enjoyable.

i remember this movie from when i was 12, it was amazing.. i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then, i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh*t! anyway, the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch, i must have watched it about 20 times. it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots, pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off "crash and burn", don't watch that movie by the way it is total pants! if your a real sci-fi movie fan then watch this, if it was re-made today it would be a winner.. i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it.

now i've always been a fan of full moon's puppet work. but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects. yes, you heard me. the story works wonderful, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job. gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name. the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better. the color was wrong, they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be. but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox, if you like gary graham or other full moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 stars out of 10.

this movie i've loved since i was young! its excellent. although, it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film (for example, our hero's name is achilles, and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the heel with a rocket, just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel). that's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing! anyway, great movie, good story, it'd be neat to see it redone with today's special effects! oddly enough, gary graham had average success, starring in the t.v. show alien nation. this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!

if you like mech war games it's pretty good. some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing. i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $350 to spare steel battalion. the movie is worth seeing at least once. there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there. less remakes and more original works. enjoy

robot jox tries hard, but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together -- robot against robot, man against man, man against woman. the premise had potential, but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed. still, it was fairly good, for a science fiction action movie. part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman. for those who aren't familiar with the name, haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "the forever war." it's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels, right up there with robert heinlein's "starship troopers" and john steakley's "armor." and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie, rather than giant robots. it's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven's "starship troopers," which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on.despite some assumptions, this really isn't based on homer's "iliad." a couple of names are all they had in common. achilles having his robot's foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad, which didn't include achilles' death. nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior. he was the mightiest, but also vengeful and petty. even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit. he was named hercules, while the greek iliad would have had herakles.the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget. true, it wasn't comparable to "terminator 2" a year later, but that movie cost ten times as much. the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in "the empire strikes back" and "return of the jedi." better, in fact, than a lot of ray harryhausen animation, which is highly regarded, but quite dated.don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed. it's better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts.

i read somewhere (in a fairly panning review) that this is something of a live-action mecha anime, and i think they're on the right lines. i first watched this movie when i was very young and i've been dying to see it again, and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back. i don't think this is to be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of good old 80's almost-a-tv-movie fun (it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future, although this point isn't stressed too much). what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn't sound generic - no clichés, no predictable lines - all in all just good fun! maybe time hasn't been kind to this little movie, but still i can find appreciation for it in me. it's by no means perfect, but it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything other than that. let the nerds and comic-store-guys worry about technicalities - who cares? see it for yourself and make your own decision. no-one else's opinion matters.

this film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason. probably just by the mass populace. anyhow, this is actually a very interesting movie. the film is an under-budget sci-fi movie which actually works, due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes. this movie may not be for everyone though. if there are any sci-fi fans reading this, i truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction. the film has crazy ideas. the setting includes nations going to war with gigantic machines which the entire countries invest all it's money in! the world has been divied up into territories. anyone can challenge anyone else to a war, or rather, a 'robot-duel'. the method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, since now everyone is wearing those breath masks. definetly a movie that makes you think. intelligent, well written, and good effects for the measly budget.i tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work.

what if a platoon of g.i.'s from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate? great pitch right? the movie does exactly what it says on the tin.thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the, usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies, scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport. no how's or why's. they just did. however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful, if not a bit dated. not as silly as one would imagine.the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t. but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g.i.s arrival to medieval japan, it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. undoubtedly it's the main order of the day. the whole concept and by extension the movie itself, was probably originated from this simple pitch: what if g.i.'s equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais? and boy does it deliver.the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70's action/war movies. not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length, it's also a terrific mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g.i. samurai can deliver. i mean, where else would you get the chance to feature tanks, ninjas complete with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurais in the same shot? the g.i. platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras, gunning them down with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks.this mish-mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of kurosawa's kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki's samurai banners, while the other is in western action and war movies. there are stylistic touches (like the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g. castellari circa keoma to mind. japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa, and g.i. samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film.the film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it. not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent, it's just that it doesn't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies. the budget was probably hefty, as it is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. the camera-work and editing are all top notch, almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves.it's not withouts its flaws either of course. there are many "song" scenes, where all sorts of 70's japanese rock, disco and country songs play over montages (there's a bonding scene, a love-interest scene, a "war is hell" scene etc). the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing. although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for the most part. still some scenes, flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect.the cast also deserves a mention, featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba, isao natsuyagi (goyokin, samurai wolf), tsunehiko watase (the yakuza papers) and hiroyuki sanada, all of them hitting the right notes.

"gi samurai" sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason, and much carnage ensues. it's a rather over the top essay of sword vs. machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results.the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title; initial fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal box?" etc etc), "aren't we better off here" discussions and ultimately a huge battle. the latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all, the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chiba's platoon; a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance. it's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length.chiba gives a gruff performance as iba, initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him. this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv. by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, as they seem to be asking "weren't we better off back then?'. but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of (almost) non stop action.

pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history. what do you do? well, if you're a hollywood studio, you change the japanese g.i.s in g.i. samurai (aka timeslip) to the crew of an american aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie. but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other. and yes, there are decapitations.of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it. impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version.

i would firstly say that somehow i remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, i couldn't read the subtitles and i thought sonny chiba was sean connery. but i did really like the concept. if you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie. that said, having just watched the restored 137 minute version on dvd i have to say i enjoyed it, though not as much as when i was seven ( i remembered the ending ). there are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments, my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ). for an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll. by the ending of the movie i had decided that this was a good thing, when seven i though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing.for an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action, especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of shogun era warriors. the makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, lets face it, humorous. i thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when i was a kid, and i am not ashamed to say that i still do.i also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum, they've got heavy calibre machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal japan theirs. which is what i'd like to think any vigorous imdb user would do in their boots.in short the movies worth watching, it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like g.i. samurai is so unique.

i just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown away. i won't bother repeating what others have said. what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. the huge battle is exhausting. afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music/songs. blues, country/folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter. it's hideous. you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded.there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. there are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully. i really wish i could erase the music but alas.seek this out. it's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing.

this movie has great style, fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme.. but all in all, i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it.. big, impressive, powerful, bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty.plot: a guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will (not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer) when he is really mad at you tries to have a girlfriend.. he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand, it's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship....sword boy is on the planet for a reason.. he just doesn't know what it is.. yet.lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively.russain w eng subtitles.. slick worth a watch..

for everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.that's because sasha, like each superhero, takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it. sasha becomes an outlaw. while on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.as you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics. it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma. everything happens very slowly. however, when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's all over. but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action. what is more important here is the outcome of sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. the score is very scarce, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.is the film worth it? that is a question really difficult to answer. i don't think that this experience enriched me so very much, but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope. after all they're young people, who have all their lives to live. so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together.

a woman borough a boy to this world and was alone. they both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm. there was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his body. first he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mom every time. then he grows up and decides to find his real father. just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches the justice....but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right 'cause it is not like in hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - sasha (he is the main hero acted by artem tkachenko) kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs. in such a runaway from authorities and mafia he meets a girl (acted by chulpan hamatova) and falls in love with her. everything else is to be watched...not told. be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions. this film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.

i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, who was made into a monster by society. suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got. but it was a happy surprise. my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole movietheatre laughing) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. so in short: not what i expected, but a very good surprise indeed. i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd.

there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately.a friend, sends me movies now and again, as a surprise, it's awesome.i turned it on and couldn't stop watching, it is a drama, but with a odd twist. imagine if romeo, as in shakepeare, had a super power. it is sad and poetic at the same time. hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story, without a spectacle. this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist. granted it's not perfect, but nothing ever is. you know what the power is but it is never explained, nor totally realized until the end. it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. i don't want to see a remake, it is too cool as is, the hollywood system would, as usual, mess it up. acting is top notch all around. directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there. kudos to all involved,and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic. a+++++if you can find i, watch it.

despite the title, the sword bearer, and the dvd cover (action/herioc poses of the sword bearer) this is not a super hero film.(minor spoilers) it follows the tale of sasha, the sword bearer, who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm. cool you say, but no, this is real life. if you had this power as a child could you control it when, say, faced by a mad man, or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her. and if you don't control it, how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12.this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him. wandering aimlessly after another killing (much like a bout de soufflé). he then meet katya, and the pair fall instantly in love, providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways. however, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers.that is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on screen, though a lot if suggested.i really like this movie. unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films, we get very little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count the sword bearer himself) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development.worth checking out if you can find it.

what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers? the premise may sound familiar. the watchmen? unbreakable? however, the russian sci-fi action flick, the sword bearer, is far from the standard stock.the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society, his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess. when he wishes or his anger allows, a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin. very wolverinish? maybe... but that's not the interesting part of this film. shunned all his life and driven by anger (and a temper he does have) our "hero" returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to. the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground. this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play. this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail. he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about.the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences. this is art house at it's core, beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action. it's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film. the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film. don't worry though, the action is there and plenty of it. however, much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath. this is not to say that action is not shown. these scenes are here and are fantastic (especially the ending where we see sasha's full powers unleashed in desperation). the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand. this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.

"mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i've ever seen. the name of the film can be translated in english as "the sword-bearer". the main hero (sasha) was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand. at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. but it is not about mechenosets. he hardly can be even called the anti-hero. i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good, justice and love. in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him (except his mother). every his step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him. and suddenly he meets her. she doesn't need the idle talks and explanations. she loves him for what he is. she doesn't care what he did. the fact that he's next to her is more important than anything else. but soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before her very eyes. even after that she couldn't escape her feelings. they try to run but it's hart to hide. finally they have a serious car accident. he is caged; she is in a mental hospital. they don't know anything about each other, but she believes that he'll save her. he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her. they run again but they aren't invulnerable. she is wounded, she needs a rest, but police almost catch them. he doesn't know what to do, they drive into a corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, helicopter around them, but there is no need for it, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is the lonely person in the whole world again.

i watched it subtitled as it was in russian, but really enjoyed it. the main character sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. he lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things. when sasha finally found love in a young woman named katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle. there was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomached.not for people who like the regular old hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent films. kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film.

i recently (may 2008) discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd. although i've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then (late 70's (i was 10 in 1978)), this three-episode, low budget thing still stands strong.what's fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter, and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then: the creepy music (she had to hold my hand, even though she's been raised with watching lotr and resident evil), the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is, and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting.this is the one and only good science fiction movie (or series) ever made in norway. and it's still worth watching.

i remember this show from swedish television. i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s. when i think of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. the term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them.

it's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from norway has been remastered for dvd release, and still gems like this don't get a shot at recapturing their past glory. i give this a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few scifi films made for norwegian television. this film is nothing less than a film-historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first alien film. and, my word, blindpassasjer was first! did ridley scott or anyone in the crew see the mini-series? however unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. okay, the budget is _much_ lower in the norwegian film, but given that, it's a really well-done piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian movie-making, which incidentally lasted until the 90s.

ok. i admit. i'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series. star trek (next generation) was my first space date, and since then i've switched partners regularly. i've seen'em all, it seems, and my favorites are «lexx», «farscape» and the new «battlestar galactica», in other words: the newest, state of the art space operas. but, i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones, the cheap ones, like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show «blakes7». here, the budgets are smaller than hobbits, the special effects seem to be made on a commodore 64, but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor, the acting dead serious and at times even high class?but why do they always speak english in the space future? because this is not the future, it's fantasy for kids. still, it can be irritating at times. me, being a norwegian, have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series, like science fiction, for scandinavian viewers. i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened. but it did, actually, once, and even in my own homeland, norway. i was two years old when the so called fjernsynsteatret (tv theater section) of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer (the stowaway).when i first heard of it, i was not surprised of the fact that until this day, the show has only been screened once in norway, making it impossible for me to actually see it. it went on swedish, danish and finnish television also, in it's time, but that was a long time ago. there have been no video or dvd release of it, not a surprise either, and when it was screened on an art house cinema, this happened in bergen, a city far far away from oslo (where i live). and then there's another fact about «blindpassasjer» that didn't surprise me, that it was written by the two norwegian authors tor åge bringsværd and jon bing (bing&bringsværd). this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegians in the seventies; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose. in my opinion, bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers, and has written several great and entertaining novels, masterpieces even, some of them hilarious, such as «bazar» and «syvsoverskens dystre frokost». no other than this guy, also an acclaimed dramatist, could construct the script of «blindpassasjer».when i finally got to watch it, it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the 80's, eventually managed to transform it to dvd and give it to me. he was a nice bloke. so i sat down and watched it, with swedish subtitles, bad sound and some scrapes and errors; but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love it.the exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in blakes7, and the credit goes to caprino studios (who made the famous flåklypa grand prix), and the interior of the marco polo (the space ship) works better than i'd expected. the acting is typically theatrical, but it works better than when they play ibsen, to put it mildly, and bjørn floberg carries his role solidly, as does trini lund. the legendary actress henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre, but this is an ensemble play, and i'm happy to say that ola b. johannesen carries his mustache with nobility, and marit østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.but is it really that good? well, one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending, the pretentious criticism of «modern society», but yes, it's, well, not really really really fantastic, but charming, cool, nostalgic and pleasant. one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi.

this movie is really not all that bad. but then again, this movie genre is right down my alley. sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did decent with what they had. if you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic b movies, then you'll love this one!! i sure did!

i watched the movie while recovering from major surgery. while i knew it was only a "b" film, a space western, i loved it. it may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non-the-less held my imagination and provided great escapism. sadly our society has so much available, discounting small attempts is too easy. in the same way that i can enjoy a even a grade school performance of shakespeare, i can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake. i am a cop and found affinity with the retired lapd. dreams like his haunt me that i will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another's life (or my own). while it was a romantic ending where farnsworth did take out the bad guy (predictable) i needed a little happy romance where good can triumph. my world is really too cynical.

the question is, can a movie this entertaining really be considered a "bad" movie? my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words "vestron pictures" on it (vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films "suburbia" and "class of 1984"). we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was. your basic plot as is follows: grange, this goombaesque thug from planet earth, robs "the bank of the moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (i don't even remember the planet's name) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. the "governor" of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor. walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the whole planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with. then there's the nameless "colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare. much of the movie centers around "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides) with explosions galore. the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet, ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts. but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid-80s. i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. i can't even remember the names of the bands (they're listed in the credits) other than exploding white mice, because that was the only one i'd heard of before i saw this movie, but i'm definitely looking into them.basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.

this is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's! i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music. anyway, i love the way the blob looks. i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party. another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night, just like halloween ii.when steve and jane are making out, they see a meteor fall from space. inside the meteor is the blob. whenever the blob consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. can anything stop this blobby creature? i highly recommend the blob!!!

"the blob" qualifies as a cult sci-fi film not only because it launched 27-year old steve mcqueen on a trajectory to superstardom, but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the 1950s. interestingly, nobody in the kay linaker & theodore simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous, scarlet-red protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as "the blob." steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall, the old west bounty hunter in "wanted: dead or alive," after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures' release. meanwhile mcqueen's attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in "the andy griffith show" as sheriff taylor's school teacher girlfriend helen crump. of course, neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers, but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers. director irvin s. yeaworth, jr., made his directorial debut with "the blob." linaker & simonson's screenplay synthesized four genres: first, the alien invasion; second, teenage delinquency; third, a murder mystery, and fourth; a horror chiller. moreover, while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes, it remains largely anonymous. in other words, the eponymous jell-o neither talks nor communicates by telepathy. instead, it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody. the tone of "the blob" is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature.as the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of "the blob," the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci-fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing. jane (anita corsaut) and steve (steve mcqueen) see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it. meanwhile, an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick. the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick. when the old timer (olin howland of "the paleface") gets a closer look at it, the goop attaches itself to his hand. the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy. steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr. hallen in town. hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office. hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation. of course, hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's forearm. hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened. our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve's fast driving. steve fools him into a reverse drive race, but the local police chief dave (earl rowe) lets him off the hook. steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor. after they visit the old man's house and rescue a dog, the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane return to dr. hallen's office. during the interim, the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer, killed hallen's nurse and attacked the doctor. neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor hallen's shotgun have any effect on the blob. steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen. when steve and jane go to the police department to report the incident, dave is frankly incredulous, while sergeant bert (john benson) believes that it is a prank. bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car.steve and jane take them to hallen's office, but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody, but dave admits that the office has been vandalized. against sgt. bert's advice, dave turns the teens over to their respective parents. no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again. they drive into town and spot the old man's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket. when they go to retrieve the mutt, steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens. they find nobody inside, but they encounter the blob. steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them. later, after they escape, steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed. police chief dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket. steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store. about that time, the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers. suddenly, a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve. steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks. the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off.the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob. the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole. as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack, the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark. producer james b. harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo."the blob" proved to be a drive-in hit and steve mcqueen's surge to stardom gave the film added momentum. unless you are a juvenile, this little horror movie isn't scary at all, but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes. they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination, so "the blob" isn't without a modicum of subtlety.

i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start "wanted: dead of alive" the same year this film came out, or be in the magnificent seven two years later, he would not have done it. but he did, and we are the richer for it.sure it's a camp classic. horror the way it was meant to be for the drive-in theater. it's fun and nostalgic.it is interesting that the last lines of the film were:lieutenant dave: at least we've got it stopped. steve andrews: yeah, as long as the arctic stays cold. they never would have imagined 52 years ago that the arctic would be thawing. the blob will soon return.

sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. in my little book, there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor. catch the redoubtable mrs. porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. she not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&w. yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. but except for several of the teens, the non-hollywood cast performs well. then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining. pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". then again, the 27-year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway. the movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. and except for the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. meanwhile, i'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water.

i had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct sicilian tv channel; amazingly, the film emerged as a heftily-priced dvd from criterion: not being sure what i had made of it initially (despite having attained cult status over the years, the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs), i opted not to make the purchase  as i did with the similar and, to me, unfamiliar fiend without a face (1958). recently, however, i managed to acquire the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which, interestingly, ported over the two audio commentary tracks from the criterion "special edition"but, regrettably, i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! anyway, looking at the film anew, i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it (despite many a narrative flaw, which i will get to later)  as a pure example of 'b-movie' schlockiness (atypically shot in pleasant color) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes. the male lead was an early role for steve(n) mcqueen and, though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain, his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging: not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and, more importantly, altruistic) kid. the special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema (showing daughter of horror [1953/7] as i mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence, incidentally, would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called "blob"!). as to the admittedly minor quibbles i have with the film: the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places, never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids' scrapes with police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob  as if fluid, whatever its proportion, can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that, at that stage, only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action)! an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob!; the original was then remade in 1988  i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though i know micheal elliott loves it). for the record, i will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director yeaworth and producer jack h. harris, namely 4d man (1959) and dinosaurus! (1960).

old horror movies are interesting, plenty of screams, plenty of shouts, and plenty of humor to go along with it. "the blob" is a classic in it's own work. steve mcqueen(1930-80) plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town. going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens. but when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky, he ends up being the victim, and steve helps him out the best he can. when its up to teen power, this movie really provides it. i know most teens have had their hardships when they act up, when danger comes around, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. when the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about "the blob" running amok, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them. the oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day, and in my opinion i think it was jell-o! when everyone pitches in to stop the menace, the town is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. i still eat jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like jello, tough! rating 5 stars

some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something: dvd menu system. i tell you the people, i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times. it was awesome. a cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was, which was the very beginning. many times the sum and bam! i was hooked. over and over and over. and over."doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." and that's just the soundtrack! i is laid aside in the bed, curled up with my vaio. the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft. the cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me, is already rested. i popped in the dvd. i was mesmerized. through the night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo."the blob. see it. steve queen, two cops, and one girl in a dress. two thumbs way up!

i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night, not knowing what to expect. i had heard of this movie, but never really any opinions on it.i have to say, i was impressed with what i saw. i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times.the blob was scary looking. now, i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it'll latch itself onto my hand.steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews, the protagonist of the film. i also liked the old man in the beginning.for a 50's horror movie, this was very well done even by today's standards.8/10.

first off, i hadn't seen "the blob" since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience. pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today. and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s "fear of teenagers". but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.sure, it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world. but "the blob" packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don't believe them. in fact, there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world. and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.to sum up, if you can take off your postmodern irony filter, there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye.

this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it. the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor. human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. nobody believes the teens (steeve mcqueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped. it's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast. the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. if you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from '88 as well.

most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid- and some of them, the blob included, scared the daylights outta me. movies like invaders from mars made it all too clear to us "small fry" that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the homeworld; the blob just reiterated that fact. i recall, fondly, late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as body snatchers and martian invaders and blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society. there was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in richmond, virginia) ran an atomic age classic every weekend. these were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "color" print of the blob had faded to a faint pink- but, man, was it fun. i dragged my mother along, and she enjoyed it as much as i did. it was there, at that science museum, that i truly fell in love with the blob. the filmmaker's intent was, of course, to make money- but it was the sincerity of all involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players), that made me fall in love with this movie. corny? you bet. cheesy? they don't get any cheesier. but, man, what a movie!

i've seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's.a strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this. a strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's, where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass. the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. when these incidents are reported to the police, they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up. they finally believe them when the mass, now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming. it then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside. the blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes, which is its weakness. it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the arctic and disposed of there. but it is only frozen, not dead...this movie has a typical setting for its period: teenagers and a small town. the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout.the sequel, beware! the blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of the blob movies.the cast is lead by steve mcqueen (the great escape)and is the movie that made him a star and aneta corsaut plays his girlfriend. i'm not familiar with any of the other stars.the blob is a must see for all sci-fi fans. fantastic.rating: 4 stars out of 5.

i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy. the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects. what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget, locally produced (valley forge pa) christian shorts. let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious. that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits. for what it was meant to be, this film is excellent. i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts, blair witch project was one of them, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. bwp was pure excrement. the blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and thoroughly entertaining. the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy. the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. bottom line is, i love this movie. i challenge anyone out there to take $120,000.00, inflated for today's dollar value, and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob. it just can't be done. period! thank you for taking time to read this review.

this is my favorite classic. it was filmed a little west of philadelphia, pa when i was 13, in 1957, and released the next year. then in 1970, i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper. i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed. i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well, and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the "home of the blob". the theater scene was in phoenixville, near valley forge park and it is still showing films today!

i grew up in royersford, pa. the town where jerry's market was. i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming. i remember a guy showing the "blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie. her hair style was the same as aneta corsaut's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind. they payed her $25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august. my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister.

the blob is a great horror movie, not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable, flesh-dissolving title character, but because it features a real societal message. it is, in many ways, a "feel-good horror film." the clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast. the two romantic leads, steve mcqueen and aneta corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. they are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people, and it's very easy to root for them.this is a pro-society movie, and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom, not out of some malevolent character flaw. steve mcqueen's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings, but quickly joins in mcqueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees mcqueen's seriousness. in this way, a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism.the authorities' initial skepticism of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong--and once the threat is acknowledged by all, all conflict within the society disappears. this unification of purpose, and the validation of the "troublemaking" teens, becomes official when aneta corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the blob. on any other day, breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent--on this particular day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. at this turning point, it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old.this is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a "generation gap" but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and that given a real crisis, people will naturally band together to restore order. "the blob" is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of "night of the living dead" (1968).much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative (and effective!) visual effects. they are undeniably clever. a lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated. the camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly "locked down" position (the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that). these scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned--the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up. in a way, this was similar to stop motion photography, but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet. even today, the effects are startling and bizarre.a very good film with an exploitative-sounding title, the blob is a must-see.

absolutely the very first film that scared me to death. i happened catch it when my older brother(r.i.p.) was watching it. it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested. shortly after, my folks bought a color set and, as luck would have it, the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday.i had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up...and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night! i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space, but you could not hear it, or see it...and once it got hold of you it was too late. even now, after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine. a true classic, and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation!long live the blob!

a meteorite falls in the country of a small town, bringing a jelly creature. an old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and the youths steve andrews (steve mcqueen) and his girlfriend jane martin (aneta corsaut) take him to dr. t. hallen (steven chase). the local doctor treats carefully the blister, and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man. when steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. steve and jane try to warn the police and the dwellers, but nobody believe on them, while the blob engulfs many people, getting bigger and bigger."the blob" is a cult and classic sci-fi. it is a low budget movie, with many ham actors and actresses (with the exception of steve mcqueen), awful effects, but also delightful and very, but very funny. this is the first time that i see this classic (i had seen the 1988 remake with kevin dillon), and i really recommend it to fans of steve mcqueen and sci-fi b-movies from the 50s. the film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "a bolha" ("the blob")

no hidden agenda. pure scifi. all fun.i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad. i was a kid :)the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten. the original one, starring the great movie star steve mcqueen (bullet), is by far the better and only version anyone should see.the movie production is dated, but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time. i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord. 10/10-zafoid

who would think andy griffith's "helen crump" (aneta corsaut) had a steve mcqueen movie in her past? but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie, which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space. the rebel is steven mcqueen (who would shortly decide that "steve" sounded less prissy), a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut. it was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders, but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous, man-eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left. but will the grown ups believe them? of course not, what do they know, they're just kids!the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best. the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many a soulful look into each other eyes, and the "adult" supporting cast probably says "kids!" very third sentence or so. but the real pleasure of the film its creature, which is well imagined, well-executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. and although clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniature sets, guys!), the blob is actually a fairly well-made film--and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure. the 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility, and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated "grown ups only" get together. make plenty of jello cubes for movie snacking! gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

i wasn't aware of steve mcqueen in 1958. i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film. (i'd been devastated by the movie "trantula" at age seven . . . but i was ten now). the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster's attacks. i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office (poor doc), and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience . . . so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors, too huge now to fit through just one. it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve-like diner, he seemed like a sure dinner to be. to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description, but in the end, better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids.i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick, trying to act brave. he knew i was in trouble, and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room, but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor, there the red pulsating, heart-like hungry dude sat, waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom. it took months to recover. i'm 57 years old now . . . i've made it.of course the blob wasn't destroyed.

i look at this page, and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic. sure, i agree to let everyone have their opinion, but here's mine:this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher, and should be seen many casual viewers around the world. sure, it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age, especially in todays world of cgi effects, but that's not why you should like it.you should like it because it actually is a scary movie, even for today's standards. it's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences, so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance. watch it, but not with a critical attitude. watch it to have fun, how it was originally intended.

the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueen's first big starring role.mcqueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece. steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence.later on, mcqueen would say he hated this film and that "he was the blob". but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute, fresh and innocent. would that we all had stayed that way.the plot is fast paced and although predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. and it's really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool (and anita corsaut before she became andy taylor's girlfriend). a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it's a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection.

the blob is a classic 1950s b-movie sci-fi flick. you probably know the story: two teens (steve mcqueen & aneta corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into an old man with some weird...blob attached to his arm. they take him to the doctor's office, and then go to find out what happened. from there, the blob spreads, eating everyone in its path. the special effects are cheesy fun, as is the story. there are a lot of great touches, like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district. it's no masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. steve mcqueen is very good. 8/10.

this movie is wonderful. what separates it from other 50's sci-fi is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, eyes, anything, yet it can't be killed. i especially like the idea that this film doesn't take place over a few days, it takes place in one night, lasting supposedly past midnight.it's also scary that once the blob gets on you, you can't get it off. you're stuck in it, as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. my all time favorite 50's sci-fi film, and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one. i can see why this rocketed steve mcqueen to stardom. all this and a catchy theme song! how can you go wrong?

this movie is of almost generation-defining importance to some of us born in the early post-war years in that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house) you almost certainly saw it. and the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you. it's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days. it had a modern, space-age storyboard for the audiences of it's time. the set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a friday midnight show. it has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in the 'why can't they let us have fun' way rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-a-cause way. all characters were identifiable to us - teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the cops - were sympathetic to us. we could relate to them allit had a singularly horrifying monster. it's first victim is heard moaning 'it hurts.....it hurts' and we were convinced and frightened. the menace grows continually throughout the story. there are intense periods of suspense, colourful effects, a fabulous lead in mcqueen, and moments of humour, both intended and not. it even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying.i saw it in summer, age 9 or so, double billed with 'i married a monster from outer space', and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that i went back a couple more times before it left. everyone i knew saw it. everyone i knew loved it.

who ever came up with story is one sick person. i rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we're all in an acting class together, and we know a couple of the actors from class. besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night, i had freaky nightmares. i kept thinking oh my god, if i get up to go to the bathroom to pee i'm going to be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something. i couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie. i also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we don't any of the boys units? you should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and chopping off units. i would watch that over and over. call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. i'm only giving this movie a 9 because you freaked me out freaks.

i think this movie had to be fun to make it, for us it was fun to watch it. the actors look like they have a fun time. my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors. not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make. i see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more, or more because we laugh together. if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them. the grander mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man. he make us laugh together the most. i would give this movie a high score if you ask me.i don't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors, but the main boy is cute. the actor with the grand chest has to be not real. they doesn't look to real.

let's think people , quit bad-mouthing the original , for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and art . lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck , but i dare say , not as pretty as katee as starbuck . i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar , war of the gods , the best was experiment in terra , i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait , then you had the women of battlestar , not to compare them to let's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six , but jane seymour's beauty could not be compared to . let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic .she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . i loved the original as much as the new .can you imagine if john calicos had a number six ? :)thankyou for listening .

this movie is pretty good. half a year ago, i bought it on dvd. but first i thought that it was the original film. i have seen the series and it is a good film, but here, they have put "the living legend,part1 and 2",and "fire in space" together. the same as they did with the first film, but with other episodes. but still, it is a pretty good film. only the ending is strange (you don't see what happens with the pegasus). but i still think that it is pretty good. the actors and special effects were good. if you haven't seen it, go see it. starring:richard hatch, dirk benedict, lorne greene, herb. jefferson jr., tony swartz, terry carter, lloyd bridges, jack stauffer.

although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows: "fire in space" and "living legend", if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out. i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. i would say if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video versions on vhs. they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now. another good video is conquest for the earth, which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves. overall, i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers.

as i said in my comment about the first part: these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess.the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.but when battlestar pegasus appears, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the cylon planets. okay, it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth, but it works for me. it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-) ).i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board. instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...so thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.

dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is great. this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking "no way he has plenty better" but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever.

wow, how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? it was surely the highlight of my year--nay--my life. as if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie, even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene. wow, what genius. and while the movie is full of plot-holes (for instance, a few clips of a t-rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber, screams "colin's a girl!" and runs out) i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet. thank you sci-fi for another classic.

this was the worst movie i've ever seen, yet it was also the best movie. sci fi original movie's are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! the line, "i like my dinosaur meat well done!" is probably the best quote ever! also, the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream. i can imagine it now, the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution, then putting ideas together for this: space marines got to alien planet, which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it, to protect a science team studying the planet. best idea ever! in fact, in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist: guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible actingso go watch this movie, but don't buy it.

i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. i like raptors because they are scary. my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana.i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it's got a good ending even though i didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that's the important part. the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time.this is best movie.

this is a film i saw when it first came out, and which i have seen a few more times over the years. it's always enjoyable.one thing is that the comedy does not take sides: it skewers labor and capitalists equally. only sid seems outside the classic struggle, even though he's responsible for it. spoiler warning: do not read further if you haven't seen the film this is a fantasy, though presented fairly plausibly. ask yourself: could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric? it would cut through almost any support.also, when cornered in an alley, sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield. cute symbolism.someday, i'll get this on dvd.

if the man in the white suit had been done in america, can't you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness's sidney stratton on for size?this is one of the best of alec guinness's films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out. it's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build. it's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree.alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment. he's a persistent cuss and he does succeed. of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive, almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist. it's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i've mentioned can be played for laughs. poor guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf, joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk> come to think of it, did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever?

what a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets: science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated, cultured audience.....the kind of english language movie only done in pre-1960 england (and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the usa.main characters in the man in the white suit(1951) starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, science reference words like "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like "long chain molecules" and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.the man in the white suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate major usa cinema.......it's a carefully acted, intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors (who play educated, accomplished people), and it's all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of.everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.it's wonderful.

i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years. needless to say, the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic. but still, alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly, if formulaic, romp through industrial post-wwii england.this is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product. remember the car that runs on water? remember the promise of nuclear energy? in this case, it's a fabric that doesn't wear out, wrinkle, or even get dirty! of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business, and so the plot gets a bit thick.guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile, and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast! (those brits ... always the stiff upper lip when under fire.) the film might chug along exactly like guiness's goofy invention, but it's a good ride all the same.

"the man in the white suit" is another feather in the cap of expert scottish director alexander mackendrick (whisky galore!, sweet smell of success). the star of the film is alec guinness (whose comedies include kind hearts and coronets and the lavender hill mob). guiness brings his usual class to the film, and makes it much more than a typical comedy.in fact, the comedy isn't entirely overt. by the end of the picture, it's nearly become a complete drama. it's the sort of ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter, but a sense of general amusement, like the best british comedy of the time.the whole idea of the suit isn't very original, but the way it is executed is. the film is highly original, and recommended to any fan of guiness or britsh comedy.7.6 out of 10

"they were always trying to get me killed," alec guinness once wrote of the man in the white suit's technicians. "they thought actors got in the way of things." he went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and, assured it was safe, narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent."people get in the way of things" might be a maxim tailor-made for white suit inventor sidney stratton (fittingly played blank slate-fashion by alec guinness) in alexander mackendrick's definitive ealing film of 1951. certainly, he cares only about his work, its realisation - and sod the consequences. and similarly, with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters, there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour.told in flashback, the film concerns stratton's invention of a dirt-resistant, everlasting fibre (fashioned into the white suit of the title), and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it.while the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market, the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job. abduction and bribery attempts follow, with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer (daphne, the delectable, 4-packs-a-day-voiced joan greenwood), to the tragi-comic end."what's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do?" bemoans stratton's landlady near the close. a notion stratton hadn't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie's ambiguous coda.a superior, if decidedly downbeat comedy, expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water...

while hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after wwii, england developed a very prolific film industry. in "the man in the white suit", inventor sidney stratton (alec guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. unfortunately, this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business! how can sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity? this is an example of one of the great movies in which alec guinness starred before he became obi wan kenobi. it's a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world. if you're planning to start any kind of business, you might want to consider watching this movie.

other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and commentary as well (or better) that i could, but i would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film. it holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category - screenplay, acting, photography, set design, sound design...it really is a classic of sorts. this was my first exposure to the "young" alec guinness, and it's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood. i only rate it an "8" because it's essentially a rather lightweight parable that examines human nature but doesn't really skewer it; and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end, rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him all over town. also, a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay - wear and tear is hardly ever the determining factor in buying new clothes (especially dress clothes); children grow up, people change sizes, gain and lose weight, and go with the latest fashions all the time, and have as long as looms have woven cloth. and if nothing else, the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms (especially bdus). still, this is a great film. if you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.

ealing studios, a television and film production company based in west london, claims to be the oldest film studio in the world. though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s, its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955, when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces, many starring the great alec guinness. such well-known titles include 'whisky galore! (1949),' 'passport to pimlico (1949),' 'kind hearts and coronets (1949),' 'the lavender hill mob (1951),' 'the titfield thunderbolt (1953)' and 'the ladykillers (1955).' one of ealing studio's most beloved films, 'the man in the white suit,' was released in 1951, and starred alec guiness as sidney stratton, a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric, an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends.sidney stratton is poor and unappreciated, but he has scientific talent in great abundance. due to his under-qualification, the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories, where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the company's own money and equipment. after being found out and ejected countless times, sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry. encouraged by his daughter daphne (joan greenwood), textile mill owner alan birnley (cecil parker) takes a keen interest in sidney's exploits and agrees to finance any further work. after numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions, sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation: an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out.if sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero, then he was sorely disappointed. the all-powerful bosses of textiles industry, headed by the frail sir john kierlaw (ernest thesiger), unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention, which could completely cripple their businesses, never goes into full-scale production. likewise, the humble labourers in the workers' union hear of sidney's creation and also set out to erase it from existence, fearing for their jobs. the inventor, however, is convinced that the ever-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many, and refuses to give in to the demand of others, despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤250,000 in compensation. throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media, only one person offers sidney her complete sympathy and support, birnley's daughter daphne, who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with sidney's plight anyway.'the man in the white suit' is a clever and hilarious comedy, made great by a witty script (written by john dighton, roger macdougall and director alexander mackendrick) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable alec guinness. there are also a few good-natured swipes at capitalism, and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations, though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate.

often tagged as a comedy, the man in the white suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there.sidney stratton is an eccentric inventor who isn't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice, he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were. after bluffing his way into birnley's textile mill, he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out, but also never needs to be cleaned!. he is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him, but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary.yes the film is very funny, in fact some scenes are dam hilarious, but it's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me. the contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here, do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries ?, you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in britain to know what i'm on about. the decade the film was made is a crucial point to note, the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay, science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions. you watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist stanley, from hero to enemy in one foul swoop, a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind !, it's so dark the film should of been called the man in the black suit.i honestly can't find anything wrong in this film, the script from roger macdougall, john dighton, and director alex mackendrick could be filmed today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has. the sound and setting is tremendous, the direction is seamless, with the tonal shift adroitly handled by mackendrick. some of the scenes are just wonderful, one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynch's elephant man some 29 years later, and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of stanley, but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world.a timeless masterpiece, thematically and as a piece of art, 10/10.

a chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out, but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries. in this delightful ealing studios comedy, guinness is marvelous as the mild-mannered but persistent chemist. greenwood, with her sensual voice, plays the love interest; parker is her harried father. thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry. while telling an engaging story, the film also raises some intriguing questions about science, the economy, and politics. it is adeptly directed by mackendrick, who would go on to make "the ladykillers" and the sublime "sweet smell of success" later in the 1950s.

i enjoyed this film. but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. it was amusing at times, but really, it wasn't very funny at all. if i'd been expecting it to be a comedy, i might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, i found it to be enjoyable and engaging. maybe it was because, as an engineer, i identified with the protagonist. i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. a man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. he's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park; me, i compare it to the fountainhead.

sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england. the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so. guiness' performance (and a great supporting cast such as greenwood, thesiger, and parker) and mackendrick's direction make the film a delight, but the real hero is the story itself, a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and suspense. rating, 8.

when i saw this film in the 1950s, i wanted to be a scientist too. there was something magical and useful in science. i took a girl - friend along to see it a second time. i don't think she was as impressed as i was! this film was comical yet serious, at a time when synthetic fibres were rather new. lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to gm experimentation of today.

in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. the theme of workers v. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesn't stop "white suit" from being a show stopping classic.the plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, doesn't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy. the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out! the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences, such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall! the script itself is full of dry wit - "is he all right?" "yes." "pity." - and characterisation is first rate. i'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. comedies of later eras would adopt a "point the camera at the actors and let it roll" mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations. this film is no exception.of course, it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights. alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work. such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he's ever worked for. joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough; everybody gets laughs without even trying to. it's comical british understatement at its finest."the man in the white suit" is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism. absolutely top notch.

although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars, alec guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. i particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from hollywood.this being said, this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies. it's plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere--except for ealing studios--which had a particular fondness for "little" films like this one.guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company. he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work! so, he tends to sneak into labs (either during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try his hand at inventing. repeatedly, he is caught (such as after he blew up the lab) and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds! then, despite the importance of the discovery, he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events--and then the fun begins.the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry, unions, the government and people in general.

one of the things that makes this ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing. shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out. (this is what was known as british understatement.) three instances: a comic fight is edited like this. alec guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry. half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed. when he catches on to this, guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door. two men block his way. "excuse me," he says quietly, taking a step forward. the two men move between guiness and the camera. cut. a secretary is sitting outside at her desk. there is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically. she takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full-fledged noisy donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked. guiness dashes out the open door.the following example would be unthinkable today. during the research phase of his invention guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth, the device explodes. again and again it explodes. the laboratory is cleared of all other work. the blasts continue. ceilings fall down. windows are blown out. the director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris, a bandage on his head. when the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air. "sit down," he tells his visitor, "there's another one due at any moment." it is excruciatingly amusing -- and there is not a single shot of any explosions. this would be unimaginable now without a fireball, and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion.last example, consisting of a series of quick, relentless cuts, put together precisely. guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract. faced with two men about to grapple with him, guiness backs up with a determined expression. he bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it. the bust topples backward and bumps against the wall. there is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall. another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down. quick cut to guiness's head rising into the frame. cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen. cut to guiness flat on his back. nobody today would have the cojones to not show guiness being crowned by that shield.i won't go on with this. it's a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity. in solving one set of problems, guiness has created dozens of others. he is opposed both by management and labor, neither of which is shown to much advantage. and of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth. "what about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it?" one of the workers asks. "vested interests," comments another worker, as thorstein veblen nods in his grave. what would happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight? if i owned shares of exxon -- and i think i do -- i'd shudder at the thought. where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil? for that matter, where would the police force and the fbi be if crime were to suddenly disappear? this is a thoughtful and very amusing movie, superbly directed and edited. the roster of performers is peerless. joanne greenwood with that husky voice. the blithering cecil parker. the wheezing mummified ernest thesiger. a first-rate job all around.

the man in the white suit, like i'm all right jack, takes a dim view of both labor and capital. alec guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one (he has never gotten his university degree due to an...err...accident in a college laboratory). he manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry. when the film begins he is in michael gough's company, and gough (in a memorable moment) is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law (cecil parker) by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs. while having lunch with parker and parker's daughter (joan greenwood), gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab's unexpectedly large budget problems. he reads the huge expenditures (due to guinness's experiments), and chokes on his coffee.guinness goes on to work at parker's firm, and repeats the same tricks he did with gough - but parker discovers it too. greenwood has discovered what guinness is working on, and convinces parker to continue the experiments (but now legally). the result: guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's molecular structure so that (for all intents and purposes) the fiber will remain in tact for good. any textile made from it will never fade, get dirty, or wear out - it will last forever.guinness has support from a female shop steward, but not her chief. he sees guinness as selling out to the rich. but when he explains to them what he's done, they turn against him. if everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes! soon parkers' fellow textile tycoons (led by gough, ernest theisinger - in a wonderful performance, and howard marion-crawford) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses. they seek to suppress the invention. with only greenwood in his corner (although parker sort of sympathizes with him), guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public.in the end, guinness is defeated by science as well as greed. but he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations, and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all.it's a brilliant comedy. but is the argument for suppression valid? at one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown (you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united. there is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat (or contract if the owner gets thin). are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever? what happened to fashion changes and new styles? and the cloth is only made in the color white (making guinness look like a white knight). we are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process. wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile? alas this is not a science paper, but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry. as such it is brilliant. but those questions i mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing guinness' invention

an unassuming, subtle and lean film, "the man in the white suit" is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios. while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure, i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot, the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course.the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as ealing's inspired "kind hearts and coronets" from 1949. this time, he merely plays one character rather than eight, but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton, he always finds the correct tone and expression. along with guinness' subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the cast are effective. of the main players, cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out. thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee, while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father. father, that is, of joan greenwood, the deftly delectable comic actress, who is at her insurmountable peak in this film. resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction, she is quite sublime in this film, a fine contrast with the similarly unusual, but more maladroit guinness. the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing...the themes are handled very effectively, with no easy morals drawn. the complexities of the relationships between science, business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined. expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick, this film is technically adept in all areas; evocative photography, fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script, all quietly impress. a thoroughly satisfying film, with guinness and greenwood magnificent.rating:- **** 1/2/*****

i've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry --- how ironic!) mostly because i wanted to hear benjamin frankel's title music again. i ended up sitting through about the first half hour, entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction, writing, and performances are. the movie is like a who's who of 50s british character stars: cecil parker, michael gough, miles malleson, duncan lamont, and particularly ernest thesiger, great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills. not to mention alec guinness and joan greenwood, not character players as such but charming, charismatic leads. this is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well. an all-time classic, and i hope no one ever tries to remake it!

this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry, and a light eccentric character study as well.the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. but it does have its amusing moments, and it is very deft in its execution. the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.the union procedures are quite droll, very reminiscent of i'm all right jack; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness' character. the political machinations actually carry the story. ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavy.i don't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers, or kind hearts and coronets; but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing.

the man in the white suit is one of those delightful comedies that ealing studies made so well in the 40's and 50's. the plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks. of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles. however, things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people, including cloth manufacturers, the cloth mill's workforces, and even an old lady that does her washing every week. the man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances, and the way that they don't always help; as the old woman says at one point in the movie, "why cant you scientists just leave things alone?"like a lot ealing comedies, this one stars sir alec guinness. alec guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence (and he does in this film, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way. he is suitably creepy in this film, and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious, but slightly naive scientist. along with guinness, the man in the white suit also features joan greenwood, the deep voiced actress that co-starred with guinness in the simply divine "kind hearts and coronets" and michael gough, a man that would go on to get himself the role of alfred in the batman films. the acting in the film isn't always great, but it is always decent, and it's fits with the film.the man in the white suit is an intelligent, thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral. the comedy isn't always obvious, and it doesn't always work, but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs, so that is forgivable. i recommend this movie, basically, to anyone that is a fan of movies.

contains *spoilers* - also, my quotes may not be exact.everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels - how true. but to me, i see this movie as much more than that. i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit. there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him, but it won't stick. alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate:"that's ingenious - can you tell me, what is the ratio of ink to petrol?"the only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasn't worked after all - standing there almost naked. yet, more than shame is the simple disappointment that "it didn't work." he's never really intimidated by people. remember,"but sidney, we want to stop it too."barely a moments hesitation before he's off trying to get away again. does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must've caused? no.also notable is dapne's role. she is sick and tired of money and power. she thinks she's finally found love, outside of her father's company. at first she doesn't really care about sidney anymore than anyone else. but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him - and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention. she's finally found something she thinks is worth living for. the funny thing is that it's not even romance. it is friendship, but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesn't fit. it's more admiration, and perhaps even inspiration.upon her discovery that michael has no real love for her, and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her, she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney. fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power, money and lust. what a refreshment:"thank you sidney. if you would've said 'yes' i think i'd have strangled you."i love the very end, when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing. but then, the bubbly, quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off, his stride matching the tune: dauntless. where is daphne? we don't really know - but they weren't really in love and she wasn't really a scientist. he got help escaping and she got "a shot in the arm of hope." (pollyanna) a cont'd relationship would've been nice, but as billy joel says "it's more than i'd hoped for..."

when i learned of sir alec guinness' death, this was the first of his many films i thought of re-seeing. what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites.

i can't say whether the post-wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not, but i am completely addicted, and the man in the white suit is one of the best. no need to go into the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic sidney stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight. many of the well-known faces from the world of british character actors - the nervous cecil parker, the suavely devious michael gough, and the bluntly ruthless ernest thesinger - put in wonderful performances. guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and joan greenwood is delectable as daphne (just the way she enunciates the word "daddy", makes the entire movie worth seeing)."knudsen!!!!!!!"

for me this is ealing studio's most perfect film - as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released.as a satire on economic notions of 'growth' and the commercial need for in-built obsolescence, it could scarcely be more up-to-the-minute. and of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot?oddly, there are parallels with jurassic park, in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you. but spielberg shied away from the book's brilliant central conceit to tack on some nonsense about 'children'. hmmm.in the man in the white suit, alec guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out. suddenly workers and capital at the northern english mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoods.of course, being ealing, it's a comedy, but it needn't have been. the complex interplay of vested (should that be suited?) interests plays out beautifully, as one by one all parties realize that 'progress' is a threat, and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms turning.but, yes, this is a comedy - albeit a pointed one - and amid the political ironies are delicious performances, and some good old-fashioned knock-about laughs.nonetheless, it's the biting satire that endures - dazzling and white.

deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser. in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.technically superb horror comedy(?) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but lets just say its pretty gruesome. if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film. personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level. here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies.. its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on-as revealed in the end-i want to go back and see what it was i didn't catch on to. there is an internal logic rare in these films.7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs, its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else.

some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous, but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them, this is also a film a film of an acquired taste! my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the thing' i.e the parasitical aliens from outta space, infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible!you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre, however cleverly maintains its own originality, well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival! only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host! to then pick another fight with another infected host! and this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away.great! but like i said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the film. it is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty, with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons, i.e saws, drills, blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent. i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next!so if you like gore, you like aliens, you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere, then i must recommend this film as a must see. i just wish i came across this earlier then i did!

why aren't more films (especially american) more like meatball machine? this is my first official on-line review and i am charged with "electrical ecstasy" after having chosen "meatball machine" as my first endeavor. this is a review, so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion.i mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo! so what if it's not all original? i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. meatball machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. thank you jesus for japanese cinema!simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so. i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. this time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring.in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! there's more!!! fight scenes!! great music!! great point-of-view shots! decent acting by the woman cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times.oh, and did i forget to mention it's a love story! wow, i hate love stories but this takes the cake!i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. sadly, i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine. the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine.lastly, my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. normally she says something like "why are you watching that junk?" this time she had nothing to say. i was glad! this is not junk. this isn't just splatter (splatter for the sake of splatter is also great). this is art my friends. art.chacho

for fans of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you! there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film, also the effects can be impressionable and awesome. the plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days.also notable are the little aliens, who i found cute. all in all, it's a good film for fans of the genre. also recommended are films such as tetsuo:the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach, filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed. of course, seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two.

most of the feedback i've heard concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed. a couple even saying that they think "it sucked". well, to those people i say, get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself. this was a very entertaining flick.the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gwar-costume looking, deathbots called necroborgs. eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you, which then is able to control your actions due to hot-wiring your nervous system. unfortunately for two love-seeking lonely young adults, they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug, and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered. is there a way to stop the transformation? maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? why do the necroborgs fight one another? do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty? only one way to find out.going into meatball machine i was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions, but it turned out being a great surprise. a few unanswered questions, some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of. from the anime feel to it, to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel, this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses. with a ever-developing story that's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make-up effects and blood splatter, this is one flick fans of bizarro/horror/tetsuo/splatter fans should check out. 8 outta 10

wow baby, this is indeed some fine asian horror/gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and guts, there is a bizarre love story. it's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs. the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human, is they need to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that, with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun. the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's "the thing" in creature design and effects. i would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds, as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore. and a must-have for stoners, because you don't even need to read the sub-titles, the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip. the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter's movies, which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour. "meatball machine" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and i simply loved it.

don't be fooled by the silly title folks, this is one sweet ride! a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer, this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll. it seems that aliens are taking over people's bodies and modifying them into war-machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species. the winner of the battle eats the loser alive. that's mostly it for plot, but who cares when the gore is this good? i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used, but it's disgusting to behold. there is interesting and effective use of stop-motion when the takeovers are in progress, and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make-up effects. the cgi is a bit limited, but that actually doesn't detract from the overall quality one bit, at least for me. this was truly a fun and stomach-turning film that deserves much praise, and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics. find it and watch, you won't be disappointed!

the japanese cyber-punk films have never really done a whole lot for me, but of the handful that i've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. meatball machine is no exception.the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts, takes control of their bodies, turns them into "necroborgs", and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of said parasites. the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other, but whose love-affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites, and are forced to fight each other. it becomes a test of human-will vs. the parasite's control over their physical bodies...meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo (as most cyber-punk films are), and for good reason. there are definitely some thematic parallels, though the films are definitely different. there's plenty of fun, splattery moments in meatball machine, and the creature/borg fx are definitely the high-point - a mixture of tetsuo-meets-gwar that are both elaborate and inventive. depending on your taste for these types of films, meatball machine may or may not be your thing. if you enjoy hyper-kinetic cyber-punk films with a healthy dose of splatter - this one's for you...7/10

meatball machine is an amazing splatter film, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood, and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines.now the film isn't for everyone, people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo: the iron man will applaud it.the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film, but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously.yet, all in all it's a lot of fun, well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles.

i don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of " tetsuo " or not . why " tetsuo " ? because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious " tetsuo " rip - off . the concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors .there is lot more gore , less eroticism and , in the case of " meatball machine " , the transformation of human being into a creature that's partially a machine( sounds familiar ? ) called " necroborg " ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens .these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . they infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs . their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eat it .all in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn't expect much , but at the end i actually enjoyed this film .as i said before , this is a low budget flick , but it's still relatively decent . don't expect much from actors , they're mostly not very good , but it can be tolerated . i liked the atmosphere and gore , certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . although the story is not too original , it possesses certain charm - to me at least .7 out of 10 .

directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi (battlefield baseball) and jun'ichi yamamoto "meatball machine" is apparently a remake of yamamoto's 1999 movie with the same name. i doubt i'll ever get a chance to see the original so i'll just stick commenting on this one. first of what is "meatball machine" ? a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. it's not something you'll end up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema."meatball machine" follows the well known plot. boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. boy finally meets girl. girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save his love. will he succeed? who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death i'm satisfied.the plot is simple, relatively clichéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. and yes it too luckily shows more violence. i'm happy. acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. it's not exactly painful for the ears but it's not exactly good either.the movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like i haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. done by keita amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. the necroborgs as they are called in "meatball machine" look stunningly detailed. without the usage of cgi amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are a-movie class."meatball machine" is "tetsuo the iron man" mixed up with "alien" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. it's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.

this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses. from the time they walk in, to the time hardy just falls off the roof, this keeps me laughing hysterically. i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short. i also recommend all of the ghost series. if you are looking for laughs, see this movie and you will be happy.

some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very, very little plot. instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious! films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house. here in dirty work, most of the film is akin to these other two films--stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean a crazy professor's chimney. seeing ollie fall through the chimney, the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film.however, in an odd twist, there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie. it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. late in the film, you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg! given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room, is it any surprise what happens next? while this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion. give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results. one of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9.

stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. professor noodle (lucien littlefield) is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula, with the ability to reverse ageing, after twenty years. ollie and stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job, and very quickly ollie wants to get away from stan making mistakes. ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney, but stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic. after breaking an extension, stan gets a replacement, a loaded gun, from off the wall, and of course it fires the brush off. stan goes up to have a look, and ollie, standing on the attic door of the roof, falls into the greenhouse. stan asks if he was hurt, and ollie only answers with "i have nothing to say." ollie gets back on the roof, and he and stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in ollie falling down and destroying the chimney. ollie, hatless, in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down, and the butler jessup (sam adams) is covered in chimney ash smoke, oh, and ollie still has nothing to say to stan. the boys decide to clean up the mess, and when stan tears the carpet with the shovel, ollie asks "can't you do anything right", and stan replies "i have nothing to say", getting the shovel bashed on his head. as ollie holds a bag for stan to shovel in the ashes, they get distracted by a painting on the wall, and the ashes end up down ollie's trousers, so stan gets another shovel bashed on the head. professor noodle finishes his formula, and does a final test on a duck, with a drop in a tank of water, changing it into a duckling. he also shows the boys his success, turning the duckling into an egg, and he next proposes to use a human subject, i.e. his butler. while he's gone, the boys decide to test the formula for themselves, but ollie ends up being knocked by stan into the water tank with all the formula. in the end, what was once ollie comes out, an ape, and when stan asks him to speak, all ollie ape says is "i have nothing to say", and stan whimpers. filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable film. stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian. very good!

i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short.in this one, stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of professor noodle (lucien littlefield). while noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab, stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room. the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp! the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head, but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this.dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest. great fun.rating: 5 stars out of 5.

a laurel & hardy comedy short. the boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of professor noodle, a mad scientist who's just perfected his rejuvenation serum. stan & ollie proceed with their dirty work, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. then the professor wants to try out his new potion...a very funny little film. the ending is a bit abrupt, but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific. especially good is stan & ollie's contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney. that's lucien littlefield as the professor.

the concept of having laurel & hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially stan laurel of course as usual.the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. it doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. it's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie.the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor.the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed. it all helps to make "dirty work" to be one of the better laurel & hardy shorts.8/10

in many ways dirty work is a predictable l&h short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney . guess what happens next ? that`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues .but there`s one or two things that seem untypical . ollie for example is very unlikable , he`s arrogant , he`s rude , and not only to stan look at the way he addresses the servant with " hey you " and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being " i have nothing to say " . in short ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and i much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he`s always at his funniestdirty work also lacks the reportary regulars of the other l&h shorts like finlayson , long , busch and housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there`s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie having said that this is still a good short mainly down to stan . also watch out for a scene featuring a fish . many jokes/plots from l&h feature fish and this is another one

this is an unusual laurel & hardy comedy with something of a split personality: at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short. happily, each portion is funny in its own right, and the boys' seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the film's disparate elements into an entertaining whole. while i've never heard a fan cite dirty work as his or her favorite laurel & hardy comedy, it's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like.our story is set in the home of professor noodle, who represents one key element of the story-line: a wildly over-the-top parody of mad scientist scenarios. this marks a rare venture into sci-fi territory for l&h; abbott & costello and the three stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than stan & ollie. in any event, the professor is obsessed with creating a rejuvenating serum that can make people younger, while his sarcastic butler, jessup, expresses the viewer's skepticism with rolled eyes and the occasional dry quip. meanwhile, stan & ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the professor's home the very day he perfects his solution. "their" portion of the film consists of characteristic (but first-rate) slapstick involving the chimney, the roof, shovels, and a number of unfortunate mishaps. if you don't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably won't like dirty work, but for fans of the team this movie is a feast. the highlight comes when ollie plummets through the chimney, lands in the fireplace, and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision, one by one. i also like the shot of ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse; the process work is so slapdash i suspect it was something of an inside joke, the way w.c. fields' movies would feature the world's worst rear-projection screens.the slapstick stuff is great fun, but it's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat, and two supporting players deserve a tip of the bowler hat: prolific character actor lucien littlefield is terrific as the professor, delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee, while sam adams is a stitch in the less showy role of jessup the butler. as great as stan laurel and oliver hardy were in their prime, it's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the hal roach studio gave their films an enormous boost. so too, usually, did the background music of le roy shield, but dirty work marks a rare occasion from this period that a roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits. mood music might have enhanced the proceedings, but no matter; this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow, and a prime example of what made laurel & hardy so popular in their day.

i'll be honest with you...i liked this movie. it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but is also packed with bad zombie effects. part iv, entitled "after death" is also good. i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.10 out of 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, slumber party massacre, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

this movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.just remember this: when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies... be they good or bad... this is the formula that they are using. this is what makes zombie movies so great.and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know.all in all, it doesn't linger. there's never a point where you think to yourself "c'mon, get on with it"... it moves quick and corners nicely. this is the sporty, little italian number of zombie flicks.so awful, it's wonderful! if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it.as a great trivia note: if you're watching it on dvd, you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... well... that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop.

nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie-flicks, but  honestly  why would we bother? every single film in the zombi-"series" delivers great fun, nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and "zombi 3" is no exception to this, despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting. this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project, who had to elaborate further on his "zombi 2" success, but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films. the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every ingenious idea from george a. romero's "night of the living dead" and "the crazies" is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at. yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything! on a secret army base at the phillipines, scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus "death one" and prepare it for transport. after a failing attempt to steal the virus, the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie-ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village. the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's "nightmare city". truly bad...but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations. the undead birds were original, for example, and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well. the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick. recommended to the fans; don't mind the negative reviews.

we have high expectations with this one . . . because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci . . . however . . . its co-directed by bruno mattei (from night of the zombies) and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso (night of the zombies) and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies (hell of the living dead) a lot. as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2. fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi (?) and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic . . . zombi 3 is not magical . . . its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter. but over the years, i've grown to accept zombi 3. i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room . . . there was a senseless fulci-cut and the mattei/fulci-cut is the one on dvd.

wow this was a great italian "zombie" movie by two great director's luci fulci ("zombie") and bruno mattie ("hell of the living dead") lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen "hell of the living dead" directed by bruno mattie and if you saw "zombie" directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great "zombie" make-up witch equals great looking "zombies" has a funny "zombie" flying head!and "zombie" birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a "zombie" (that only happed to two people) but they are mainly just the great toxic "zombies" like in bruno matties "hell of the living dead".so if you like italian "zombie" movies or just "zombie" movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian "zombie" movie!

a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised. soldiers are able to retrieve the case, but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out. they eventually make it to where he's hiding, and "cleanse" the hotel and its occupants. unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation, and if you've seen return of the living dead, you know what happens next.zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike, as a complete mess of a movie. while that's a fair assessment, it's not without it's high points. for one thing, it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy. there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible. they're in the water, the rafters of houses, hiding in trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush, only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape. there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. you have to see it to believe it, as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo. it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting, especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen, but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind. zombi 3 fits that bill, and then some. it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers, and watch it with some like minded friends. i give it an 8/10, just because of sheer enjoyment.

yeah sure it's cheesy, it's not zombie, but it's not that bad either. it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus, and it's entertaining. i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience, as he was never completely satisfied with it. it is well worth a search out, especially for genre and fulci fans. it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand.

off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly. secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno (rats, night of terror) mattei. this is no dawn of the dead folks.that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen. the script is wonderfully horrible. just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("let's try putting these two molecules together"). the zombies come in all varieties. from moaning shufflers, to machete wielding maniacs, to birds! the gore is plentiful. legs are bitten off, arms amputated, stomachs burst open. the pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. then there's the head in the fridge. oh the head in the fridge! one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2.you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film. get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night.did i mention the head in the fridge?!?!?

although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor (zombi 2) i actually like this one better. this is because of it's faster pace, better settings, and cool 80's soundtrack. it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci. the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good. it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness; for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror? there's even a flying zombie head! how rad is that? definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. also check out zombi 4.

zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making. firstly, it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2, with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a. romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi. confusing enough? basically, none of the films have anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money. i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out. bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time.zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare. scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok. the scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet. overall, i actually liked this film. i heard horrible things, but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable. the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution, corrupted military, man playing god, etc. i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when mattei came on board.besides ripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies. you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with, "when you see the men in white suits & gas masks, run to them for help." this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies. later, they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake.the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner. how is it cool? let me count the ways1. zombie birth 2. flying zombie head 3. zombie birds. 4. zombie with no legs swimming in a pool. my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station. he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl.favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, the scientists asks, "don't you think that once the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground, and contaminate everything?" to which the sargeant boldly replies, "now you're talking science fiction." he also continues to mention the "science fiction" told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.extras: gallery, trailers, and interviews, most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes, yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details.bottom line: a must see for zombie and fulci fans.rating: 7/10molly celaschi www.horroryearbook.com myspace.com/horroryearbook

born again is a okay episode of season 1. the reincarnation bit, in my opinion, is cool. the more i watch it, the more i like it, yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me. even though it is not very memorable, i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode. anyway, now i will say what is good and bad about this episode,the good: oragami. oh yeah!that fish tank was nice. =]thrown out of a window. very classy. x]the bad: marry your best friend's wife!? o_owhat a random pick to reincarnate.why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up, try to take his scarf off instead?conclusion: okay episode, not very memorable. 7/10

hmmm, yeah this episode is extremely underrated.even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts. i think the good over wins the bad. i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end. i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony. it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1. for some reason, people have always hated the reincarnation episodes, yet i have always liked them. they're not the best, in terms of writing. but the theme really does interest me,i'm gonna give it a three star, but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four.

born again the limerick: if a man could come back from the dead and live in a little girl's head revenge he would get for the murder he metby the guy that's now in his wife's bed.for me born again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined the x-files for me before i started watching it. i saw a few segments before when the show first came on and i was much too young to watch it such as parts of the jersey devil, but i very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. i tell you i couldn't sleep for weeks! for this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that i have since grown to enjoy. its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. you'd think her parents would have been worried. and maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story. and was was with the telekinesis? other than adding the really cool carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it. but even with its little flaws, in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it. 10 out of 10.

return to the lost world was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of the lost world.in this sequel, the same five people, lead by challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land. gomez has something to do with this. they manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the natives.like in the lost world, what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t-rex and ankylosaurus.john ryhs-davies and david warner reprise their roles as challenger and summerlee and three of the other actors are also back.despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs, i enjoyed return to the lost world.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world. the five members of the first expedition return (see the lost world, 1992, for a list of actors). a man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau. instead of striking oil they tap an underground volcano which threatens all life in the lost world. the oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition. although the situation looks hopeless.... (i'm not going to tell you the ending).
