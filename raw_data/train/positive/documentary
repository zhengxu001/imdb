the haunted world of edward d. wood, jr. isn't a particularly good documentary. aesthetically, it's lackluster and cheap looking, the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in-cohesive, but this adds to it's charm. i say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and, as such, there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits. there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood, and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary. overall, it's worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general, but don't expect brilliance here. expect a documentary made after wood's own heart.

i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre. i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed.documentary about the infamous edward d. wood jr. covering his life and movies. there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. they include: vampira, dolores fuller, bela lugosi jr., loretta king, gregory walcott and paul marco. interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations. it is interesting (somewhat) but was this really needed? i've seen all of wood's films and they're just terrible. wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out. i wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there. do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker? i do like the fact that they didn't try to make wood out to be some sort of saint. more than a few of those interviewed (especially lugosi jr.) pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear. also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. still it's of interest if you're a wood fan. the best interviews are with vampira (who tears wood apart) and dolores fuller (a long time girlfriend).

i loved this film. not being a swooning ed wood jr. fan, i prefer to appreciate his "boundless enthusiasm" and acknowledge his shortcomings. his movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain. i hoped, and was delighted to find, that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life, rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise. from beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr.what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as ed's. we get insight into ed's personal and professional life: from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.the film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful (sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president). the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real. the dvd is full of impossible to find gems ("crossroads of lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him (for better or worse), to the point where one woman will go down in history as "swimming pool owner" for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool. this ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created. somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.even the title hints at the b-list horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness. what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood's legend.in many ways a living contradiction, ed wood jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint. this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get. being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.

"the haunted world of edward d. wood, jr." is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as "glen or glenda", "bride of the monster", and, of course, "plan 9 from outer space". this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries, such as "look back in angora" and "the plan 9 companion", failed. it rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work. nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day. the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer. best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.

what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band. this disc is not for the faint of heart...the music is incredibly intense, and very cool. what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long. it is true that their records were great, but their shows were the top of the heap. in 1969 when this concert was shot, the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands (and audiences) had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity--something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina. what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. try the concert out, it really is amazing.

this is the who at their most powerful. although before the masterwork who's next, which would provide anthems like baba o'reily and wont get fooled again. this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70's.daltrey shows what being a front-man is all about, entwistle steady as ever. moon is great, check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech, and see him playing "side saddle" whilst having a bass drum head replaced!townsend even looks like he's enjoying himself occasionally!considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep! there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one.

this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle.the original drum and bass.there seems to be very little early who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be 'aving it, now-a-days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. to be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they've earned their respect and with overtime.this concert footage for me is one of their best. to command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music.we all know of the other acts on the bill, the doors (their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died), moody blues, hendrix, taste, free and many more. the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see. this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the 1960's; woodstock. the film and record had come out and so had the who's greatest work to date, tommy. the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to "grove and love" in the knowledge that this gig was their own. to do this you needed the best of what rock 'n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd.at two 'o clock in the morning in late august 1970 the m.c. announces, "ladies and gentlemen, a small rock 'n roll band from shepherds bush london, the 'oo".john entwistle's body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel's and long flowing hair, keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he'd preferred to wear.the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists' greatest tracks such as young man blues, shaking' all over, and then as on queue, keith baiting the crowed to "shut up, it's a bleeding opera" with tommy, the rock opera. the crowed went wild. this is what they had come to hear, and the who didn't disappoint, straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of "tommy can you hear me?" amazing.to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history.the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english/linear pcm stereo, were as in the states, i think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, "check local press for details" on that, okay.the duration of the dvd is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. yes, for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be, live, raw and in your face!i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice.thanks roger, pete, john and keith.

for muslim women in western africa, married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard . the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour, but equally, they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal, an attitude which of course enables it to continue. fortunately, the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all, and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children. what is notable (apart from the uplifting central story) is how, in spite of their informality, the courts are actually pragmatically progressive, if a case is actually bought. the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life-style, which (aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases) seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america. and while i concede that this comment may betray naiveté on my part, this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin-english they speak. overall, this is a terrific little film, and much more fun to watch than you might imagine.

sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in sweden. a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. it was shown in göteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto, "director in focus" of the festival. she gave a master class, very much appreciated, telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice : the first version got lost for good, so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end. a pretty awful problem happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very strong movie.

this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in cameroun's judicial system-- policewomen, lawyers and judges. despite tremendous difficulties-- lack of means, the desperate poverty of the people, multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious/ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants-- these brave, strong women are making a difference.this is a rare thing-- a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind. despite the atrocities we see in the movie, justice does get served thanks to these passionate, hardworking women.i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states. the more people who see this film, the better.

this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon. the "sisters" in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council. it is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges. it will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon? have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses? was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court, against the express wishes of the husband, a one time event? i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions. they made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. and the movie they made deserves a wide audience.

a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association (wla) of kumba, in southwest cameroon, in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence. in this muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. after 17 years of failed efforts, leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories.the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa, a state prosecutor, and beatrice ntuba, a senior judge (court president). both play themselves in this film, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, though i imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. four cases are reviewed, and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film.two cases involve repeated wife beating, with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child, age 8, by an aunt. one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce. we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials. the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines; the divorce is granted.the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. this is a highly important and well made film. (of interest is the fact that one of the directors, ms. longinotto, also co-directed the 1998 film, divorce, iranian style, which dealt with related themes in tehran.) (in broken english with english subtitles). my grade: b+ 8/10

sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating 'divorce, iranian style' which was as exactly as it stated, as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran. now they've turned their attention to the court system in cameroon, africa. what's great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women, which is unusual for such a country like this. anyways, they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society, with divorce legal and women's rights being recognized. so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times. not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment. one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt. the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury. and who said that justice isn't served anymore? with these 2 behind the bench. they often carry out maximum penalties! ya! you go girl!

there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series.rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america.overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.

the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler's grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe. clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the "allied bias" turning out to be historical fact. the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east. the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. the disparity between hitler's military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag, declaring "peace in our time" to this day has durable propaganda qualities. here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options, freedom or slavery. in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively.

adolf hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u.s. war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii. hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived, starting with the conquest of eastern europe, expanding to the european heartland, then moving on to the 'world island' consisting of europe, asia and africa. his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world.in 1935, hitler ordered national conscription, as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. grade school children sang his praises, and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. marching unopposed into austria in 1938, hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland. in 1939, hitler took all of czechoslovakia. later in the year, the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non-aggression pact with it's mortal enemy russia, a ploy to delay hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. immediately after, germany invaded poland, bringing hitler's conquest right to russia's doorstep. he would deal with her later.it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler's thrust across europe. prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany, his infamous declaration stating 'peace in our time'. it didn't turn out that way.the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment, at least to me, was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid '30's. it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland. the venue - madison square garden!

this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war. the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler's rise.every school child, nay, every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos. history has been repeating itself over and over again! the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups, are still working to these evil group's advantage.by sitting back and letting hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - france, america and england caused over 50 million people's deaths. americans, french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties.these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs. they don't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them, fighting hitler. this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war.

wow! this film is the best living testament, i think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in nyc, compared to anything shown by the major media outlets.those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside. this film shows you what happened on the inside. it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman, waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight. the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers. you are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene, into the lobby of tower one. in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane, and tower two's subsequent fall, you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby. it is a sight you will not soon forget.heart-rending, tear-jerking, and very compelling from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made.we must never forget.

when this first came out 6 months after the tragedy, i didn't want to see it. i didn't want to open old wounds. i regretted it. now i have seen the movie. thank god i did. it shows you the bravery of all the fdny and nypd. i salute you. it offered me closure. i can now move on with my life.

these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive. this is definitely a movie about survival, but not without it's touching moments.the finest piece of work i have seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of new york city.

if i didn't know any better, it almost seems like it was staged, but it wasn't. it was set up perfectly, and how they got all of that footage is amazing! the unfortunate events of september 11, 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic. just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september 11.

spoilers 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc.2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it.before 9/11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario. on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change.as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane,this is the only footage of the first impact.he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building.as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident.in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible,in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds,these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground,this is the most grueling moment in the documentary.then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life,you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building.then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black,he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york. because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody's memory.i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of,so this makes it even more realistic to watch. 10/10

amazing documentary. saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years. i was shocked that it wasn't even nominated for a best documentary oscar for 2002, the year it was released. no other documentary even comes close.it was on tv recently for the 5th anniversary, but i missed the added "where are they now" segment at the end, except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit.i've seen criticism on documentary film-making from a few on this list. i can't see how this could have been done any different. they had less than 6 months to assemble this and get it on the air. the dvd contains more material and background.i'm also surprised that according to imdb.com, the brother have had no projects in the four years since. what have they been doing?

made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet, and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york's finest shone on it's darkest day. i first saw this when i was a young naive 12 year old, and at that age it still touched me. knowing how serious 9/11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9/11. we were finding out who the heroes were, how there everyday lives were composed, and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves. these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them. watch if you can,this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen.

the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did, they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened. they were in building #2, when you could see papers drifting down, people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height.i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running, their camera was still running, when the white dust covered them, they found a shop doorway and got inside, but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us.ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every 9/11 so i'll never forget what this country went through. i believe if i remember right, it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters, while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral.

difficult film to comment on, how do you say it's bad? well it isn't, but then it's equally difficult to say it is good. what it is, is compelling viewing, it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there. it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life, you know you want to turn away but you have to watch.the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well, even in the most tragic of circumstances, there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults. the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on.you can't change history, and you should not want, this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour.

i've read most of the comments here. i came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 9/11 is a shocking piece of history. there are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and i agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. about two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about tony. but i don't think narration is unnecessary. like i lot of theorists i think that our own lives are narrations. we are living and making our own autobiography. so if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration. we don't sum up facts like: birth, childhood, high school etc. we create a story about our live.because we are familiar with stories, we want to put history in a story as well. because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. we can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story. so that's the purpose of adding a story in documentary. the story is weak, so be it, but we understand whats going on. if it was me out there i would be worried sick about my brother.and the second point, making a blockbuster movie about it. true, it's been to recent to come up with a big movie about 9/11. though, there have been a few about the subject, but none of them like this documentary. but what if there will be a movie in about 5 years? i agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9/11. but i also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history. how many movies about the world war 2 have we seen? if i had not seen these movies my view of the ww would me totally different. i remember seeing schindlers list, and i cried for an hour during class. movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties. so my point: telling stories is not always bad, it makes us identify with the story, and makes us never forget what happened.

the events of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers. in my view it would have been better to leave this out. i think the directors tried too hard, perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop. the comment of one of a policemen - "this aint f***ing disneyworld" is apt.nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events. the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other footage from the day matches what they shot.

let me get the bad out of the way first, james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day. really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery.that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes. i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september 11th. it is a second home to me and i can't help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city. this is the real deal, in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them. i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day. it is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was.conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.

i live in missouri, so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me, this brought it home. that two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of fdny and nypd did, just to document the horror that unfolded on that day. this film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings.

gédéon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters. what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11.having worked with james hanlon's ladder company before, jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while gédéon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened. an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules, and he pointed the camera up, seconds before the plane crashed into tower one.jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers. the first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film. he stayed on site for the next several hours, filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there.the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent, grizzly, and gory. but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse, and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored. the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis. unlike a feature film of similar title, most of the money from dvd sales go to 9/11-related charities. very well made, emotional, moving, and completely devoid of political propaganda, is the best documentary of the sort to date.

i have to say that the events of 9/11 didn't hit me until i saw this documentary. it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation. i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers. i was sick of hearing about it. when this was aired on tv a year and a day later, i was bawling my eyes out. it was the first time i had cried since the attack. i highly recommend this documentary. i am watching it now on tv, 5 years later, and i am still crying over the tragedies. the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing. it was an accident, and look where it got them. these two brothers make me want to have been there to help.

i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 9/11. he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding. i liked the way it was told as a "documentary." if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning 9/11, this would be the one! normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known. this movie had nobody known. also, you see a movie concerning 9/11, you hear about a fire-fighter or two losing their lives saving people. i didn't feel this had any of that! i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection! very well done indeed! my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of 9/11!

incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th. intense, personal, and completely riveting, 9/11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident, which kind of gives it an even greater appeal. up until that morning, filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team, concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman. out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup, jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center, and from there a simple documentary was no more.viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero, as the amazing group of fire-fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster. without hesitation, naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them. the raw fear of an unknown, impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside. nearly as memorable is older brother gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed. by the time we get to see the second tower collapse, as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris, we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up-close footage captured.obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event, though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event; in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document- only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage, even if it cost them their own safety.after viewing 9/11, and seeing that it came out in 2002, i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone's recent rendition, the big budgeted world trade center. many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble, and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought, 9/11 all but renders his film completely obsolete. not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day, but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again.

to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible. every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images, through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero, but every frame is real. the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york. jules (28) and gideon (31) naudet (pronounced "nau-day") want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters, beginning with a "newbie" from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter. seeking the help of their close friend, actor james hanlon (36), an actor and firefighter at station 1, engine 7, the naudets sift through the "probies" at the academy and find one, tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on.tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family. firefighters have a superstition about "probies." it is that they are either "white clouds" or "black clouds," meaning that with the latter, all kinds of fires follow the "probie." the former means that very little fire activity follows, but one day, there will be the mother of all fires. tony is a "white cloud." after some initial growing pains, tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet. then the unthinkable occurs....september 11, 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street. because jules has had little camera experience, gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief, t. k. pfeiffer. arriving at about 8:42, the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate. then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene, and as jules pans upwards, we see the first strike of the day. american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade. pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center. once there, jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower. pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him. once inside, the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives. gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area. once there, he captures the impact of the second plane, united airlines flight 175, with 2 world trade. he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers. watching and capturing the crowds' reaction to the unimaginable, gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan. inside tower one, jules records the last view the world, or loved ones will have of their sons, fathers, uncles, grandfathers, husbands, boyfriends, friends as one by one, each firefighter, carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped. jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother, kevin, as he leaves to do his selfless duty. also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones, sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke. but jules is respectful, never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment...the money shot. his work is professional through his baptism of fire. he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building. then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken: father michael judd, the chaplain for the fire department. then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two, tower one begins its structural collapse. what results is a breathtakingly, poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day. not knowing if either is alive, each fearing the worst. as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse, they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back. and in one moment of overwhelming emotion, jules and gideon are reunited. as jules cries on his brother's shoulder, gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject. there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos, who left the station with a former chief, is believed to have been lost...but returns to the fold, this "probie" has proven himself.shown with only three interruptions, 9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking. it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds. the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject. in lesser hands, the tendency would be toward the sensational, but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion. narrated by hanlon, we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11. robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre, restrained way. he never seeks the camera for his own glory, rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see. i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special. chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings, they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished. this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is. it isn't about dribbling a basketball, or selling an album of hate lyrics...9/11 is about humanity at its best. heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom. 

this was the most visually stunning, moving, amazing and incredible story i've ever experienced. quite frankly, even those adjectives just cannot describe it. i can't just choose one scene that stood out for me. i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator, who were unaware of what was going on, as they finally emerge to the horrific scene; the shock and disbelief of the onlookers; and finally the silence. on that day, and even now, i am reminded of star wars (1977). obi-wan says, `i felt a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.' it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description. there was truly a disturbance in the force.this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance. the feelings are so incredibly visual. the anger, the frustration, the shock, the fear, the exhaustion, and the realization of its very magnitude. it's all there. not a thing is missed.this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy. not just because it documents 9/11 but because it is simply everything it should be. if you plan to watch, be sure to grab a box of tissues. you'll need them. i know that i did.

to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed, i disagree. this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day.imdb asks us to rate this movie. i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable. we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened. they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother's safety. to judge whether it's nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing, amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer. i just know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other.i submit a wholehearted 10. this is why the art of filming was created! to capture the natural emotion that real life offers. you can keep your kung-fu junk. romance is cute. action will never reach this level. this movie, 9/11, will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself. it didn't have a sneak-peek. it didn't have all of the blatant vanities that a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare. it had class, composure, substance, and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world. it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera. please consider this movie, as it itself proclaims, a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free, beautiful name of america.how can you give anything less to a movie that shows, not embellishes, the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times. i love "the godfather" but "9/11" is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world. it is art without question or questions.jf

i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs. i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day, i was going to school at hunter college. i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again, but like many i was curious to see what this was all about. tears came to my eyes watching this documentary. all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable. i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times. how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible. if you have not seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check it out. it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes, but it's an incredible document of this countries darkest hour.

great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time.. that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item.. what shocked me was not only the attacks, but the"high fat diet" and physical appearance of some of these firefighters. i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that,in the physical shape they were in, some of these firefighters would not of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear. having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job. the french have a history of making great documentary's and that is what this is, a great documentary.....

very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on 11th september 2001.the main theme of it is the heroism of american fire-fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could.the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing-many people seen on screen have lost their lives!recommended.

**warning! mild spoilers ahead!**(yes, i realize it's tough to spoil an historical documentary, but i do reveal some of the backstory and methods.)this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage, but also due to the story behind it. because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of 9/11, but rather that of a rookie firefighter, the men's emotions and the viewer's connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective. in a filmmaking sense, "9/11" is textbook. if the events were an actual script, they would be superb, as the characters are established, then thrown a curve to which they must react. this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together. the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station; specifically, how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans. that part alone is quite good, and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course, it probably would have been solid. the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter. then of course, all hell breaks loose. the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen, as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations. seeing not only the attacks, but also the first-hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion. the aftermath, in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found, is human drama at its peak. life and death hang in the balance. unlike many movies, the viewer not only doesn't know who will live and die, but genuinely cares about them. the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro (whom i like) blurbs were uninformative, unnecessary, and didn't advance the story at all. they were probably added just to attract more television viewers.bottom line: the best documentary i've ever seen. nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama. 9.5 out of 10.

9/11 is a classic example of cinema verite, a sort of realist documentary, in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history. it's all tiny, unobtrusive, hand-held video cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming (and by the director, naudet's hand frequently wiping the screen).in this film, you get to know most of the firemen - tony benatatos, the rookie (or 'probie', in ny fireman vernacular), the fire chief joseph pfeiffer (who finds he's lost his brother later on) and a few others. there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasise the personal, reflexive nature of the events. the build-up is quite dramatic and well-done, particularly the passing-out ceremony at the fire department, with a few useful swish-pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork (just like rob reiner's a few good men). tony looks proud.the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen, which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc1 while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next - this is classic cinema verite. there is also the eery, haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside. it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and this is before wtc2 collapses. you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment.the sound of the neighbouring wtc2 collapsing is so awfully sad, poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen. from the lobby, it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened. you hear an enormous rumbling, trembling maelstrom - like that of a giant, monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded - the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc1 are oblivious to this event. where is the communication?this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided - cues like 'this really was a day like no other' or naudet's frequently banal pronouncements like 'you could see fear in everybody's eyes' and 'i knew tony was freaking out'! the film is really just one long video diary. there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone. imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day. the effect would be greater. you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and, perhaps, the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero.i don't see much of a propaganda element in this film, as some reviewers suggest. this film is no triumph of the will, by riefenstahl. some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby, surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero. so what?there are also some moments of dubious camerawork; for example, who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station? is it staged?there is an excellent finish, very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais (hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water, shimmying.

it's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes. and none more so that september 11, 2001, a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism.no, this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11. rather, the filmmakers, brothers gédéon and jules naudet, set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter. they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training, and had handpicked their "proby" (probation firefighter) to join them in an ny firehouse, home to ladder 1 and engine 7. but their production was to develop and contain at that time, believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center.i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming, and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad, who informed me of the above. few minutes later, he told me there was another, and that the wtc was under attack. by the time i arrived home, the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke, and to my horror, they collapsed, under an hour.the filmmakers had two cameras running that day, one who had followed a team out on a routine call, and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it. we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters, paramedics, and police had to make sense of what happened, and to quickly develop a plan of action. the other camera, held by the other brother, was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling, and along the journey, captured the many expressions of new yorkers, as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten.peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7, which miraculously, did not suffer any casualty. but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil, as they struggle to come to terms with the event. through the events that unfold, we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs, to save lives.we began with what the documentary was supposed to be, before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus, right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures. it's not a film that is fabricated, and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary (and heavens, not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters). it's as close as you can get to that day, witnessing the event up close, from safety.code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7.

"9/11," hosted by robert deniro, presents footage from outside and inside the twin towers in new york, on september 11, 2001.never too grisly and gory, yet powerful and moving. "9/11" is a real treat. anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything.5/5 stars --

my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her. she's from china and only heard so much about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary. i felt awful watching this documentary, it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes.but i'm extremely grateful that i watched this documentary, because on the day of september 11th, i'm sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard, all of us could only think certain questions: "why?", "how?", "what's going on?", "oh, my god!". almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others. but i don't think we thought about what they were really going though. this wasn't actually supposed to be a documentary about 9/11, the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything, outside and in, on tape.on sep. 11th, i thought to myself "it's ok, the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived". to be honest, i thought it was an accident, i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class. someone came into the locker room shouting "some building just got bombed in new york!", we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv. not only 15 seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident. a few minutes later, we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down. so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking "what are the firemen and policemen going to do?". but it's procedure to them i thought, they'll know what to do.the first tower collapsed, we knew it, so many lives are now gone, the second tower crashed, things would never be the same. those firemen in this documentary showed courage, confusion, and strength, the real raw human emotions. they didn't know what to do, they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers. they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows. and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv. i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help. i know they feel like they were just doing their job, but they did more, they were hero's. every day after sep. 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors, but they kept on hoping and praying. may god bless their kind and brave hearts.as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks. she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day. she asked "why?". i didn't know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be that evil. "it sounds clique', but it was a normal day for everyone" one of the firemen said in the documentary. no one expected this to happen. not like that, those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked, they were just doing their job, happen to be there, or even just was there for a second passing by. they were not just murdered, they were slaughtered, and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart. then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating, why do people do this? they celebrated death and the lose of: mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. why? so, thanks to those people for making this documentary. you truly think about the firemen, policemen, and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world. thank you to all those people, you are our heroes.10/10

i was one of many that expected to see a glorified, yankee-doodle dandy portrayal of a day that (as famously quoted) should live in infamy, rather than glory. how wrong i was. these guys were there, right in the middle of it, and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking. and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september 11, 2001.two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter, particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks. at the beginning we see much of this footage, just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism. this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge.while investigating a suspect gas line (i think, my memory's a little hazy on that), we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead. the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers. what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time? recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on, and possibly realizing the same thing, the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building.what follows is a true view from the front-lines. we see the commitment of the fdny, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling) as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera captures the events from the outside.if it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering, the footage alone would be any young doco-maker's dream come true. quite simply, the footage deserves to be preserved for all time. but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer. we see firefighters charging in without hesitation, people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another (they are brothers) as they cannot reach one another in the confusion. there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film, something hollywood could never duplicate (even though it's trying).9/11 isn't a film about politics. nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter. 9/11 is a film about people, and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of. 9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films i've ever seen, and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me. you can't duplicate this.

i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary. i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much. i was wrong. this is not propaganda, in fact it is hardly political at all.it depicts the events of 9/11 through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed. it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all! this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming "a man". we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them.a great piece of work. absolutely stunning material. highly recommended.regards,

this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004, so i was definitely going to watch the repeat. i really sympathised with the main character of the film, because, this is true, i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (eb). this is a sad, sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. jonny kennedy speaks like a kid (because of wasting vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition, and pealing off his bandages. jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour, he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin. he tells his story with the help of his mother, edna kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and jonny's supporter, nell mcandrew. it won the baftas for best editing and best new director (factual), and it was nominated for best sound (factual) and the flaherty documentary award. it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004. a must see documentary!

this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time. jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love. watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching. listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming. and seeing him smile was indescribable. i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant. please, if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy.

i was greatly moved when i watched the movie.how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing. so many people only care about what they want , and fuss about all the things they don't have . and they are such small things ,like chothes,money a new car . i've seen people in tears because of a blemish. this movie brings everything back to the basics . love,hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life.it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant. you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food ,a roof over your head and your loved ones around you .you are truly blessed.and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning.and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith,strenght,and humor with me .thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above.

this man is nothing short of amazing. you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events, and cry along with his family in the end. he was so passionate about his cause, not just for himself, but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain. i watch this video every time i am having a bad or "down" day, and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life, just like jonny did, even with his unbearable pain. my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner, as i visited england 2 times during his life, and would have been able to say i'd met him. it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud, pain free! rest in peace, dear jonny. you deserve it!

the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created. i cried the whole way through, from start to end. watching the show you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we would take for granted. the first time i heard the title, i was almost scared to see the program, it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life. i truly felt for him. the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin. could you imagine doing that? even more so, even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity. (debra)jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a role model, what a true and undeniable hero he was!

in september 2003 36-year-old jonny kennedy died. he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (eb) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a film, first broadcast in march, that was an uplifting, confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. not shying away from the grim reality of eb, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full. produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year. it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonny's charity, debra. a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy.

i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy. i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him. i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. this man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. i believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools. i also agree with other comments - what have i got to moan about? he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. god bless. i couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed. i have enough trouble with my son's.

was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so i turned to my twin sister and said, "hey this looks like fun," - truly i love documentaries - so we started watching it. at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... i cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another kleenex, then cried some more. once jonni kennedy's "time was up" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. he was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. i highly recommend this. if you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.

i couldn't hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary. it was heart-breaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one. i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives. or simply, something that will make you think. you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life. you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude. at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual. you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us. his life and struggles will make you cry, laugh, and find that life's a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time.

all i can say is, if you don't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie, then you're not human! even after watching it for the first time, i was hooked. it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe, as i'm sure other fans will attest to. after watching it, you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. at least we have grey gardens to remember them! i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with. although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy, she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do. what a rare treat to have know such people; i only wish i had!

i really can't remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite films. it is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident.someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. i really can't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year. how can you improve on this? the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton's. in the process they become recluses and what is best described as "crazy cat ladies." they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie. this film was done after that rescue. all during, you couldn't help but think, "how bad was it before?" it's a look at high society from the darker side, and it is utterly fascinating.

one of the best love stories i have ever seen. it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but lovely nonetheless... big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and are infinitely quotable: "it's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just shut up?" the opening explanation of little edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever, and so will big edie "the world famous singer" and little edie " the world famous dancer."

it's interesting how the train of research can flow. i started out looking at an article about cristo's "the gates" in central park. the article stated that the maysles had been cristo's filmographers for years. hmmm... then i got to looking at their body of work. i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation. grey gardens sounded very interesting. video station, in boulder co, is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock. dvd and vhs. edith and edie are women living in the past, and oh what a glorious past it was. edith had been well off, born a bouvier, married well, had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties. her daughter edie had been a débutante, a fashion model and had many beaus. she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate. she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind. worrying too much about things. it is only a shadow of the world they live in though, because jackie o. came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. it is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out. but, in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls. if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess. the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative. the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude, but she doesn't in the movie. edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings "tea for two". edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56. it was a good movie, though not for everyone. when the cat is urinating behind edith's portait she states, " at least someone is doing what they want"!

i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill, jackie kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the maysles' to make "big edie" and "little edie" the subject of a film. they certainly could be considered the "skeletons" in the family closet. the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. i'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating. (i.e. "are they nuts? or am i missing something?"). this movie is hard to come by. netflix does not have it. facets does, though.

when it first came out, this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation. luckily, it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema, especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television, and the bad evolution of most direct cinema.really, at first, we must say that this isn't really direct cinema, it is more cinema verité. the difference between the two is very slight, but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary, we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers, and they do interact with the characters filmed. this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation. the meysels have been allowed in the house, and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household. and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed.it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews. here, we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house, a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith. their house is a mess, litter and animals everywhere, faded colors and furniture all over the house, and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality. these two people have lived with each other their whole life, and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention, but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way. they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings, there is no need. in the end, though, even as they blame each other for their lives, they really love each other deeply. edie says she doesn't want her mother to die, because she loves her very much, and edith says that she doesn't want edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone.but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age, the two women can't help be girls. they cannot help being one the singer, the other the dancer. exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera. when edie asks david meysels rhetorically "where have you been all my life?" she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills. a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again, the way only the meysels and few others could do.

little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for. even though their house was filthy, this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness. on the message board a poster wrote that "little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old." this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version, big edie says to little edie, "if you're stuck, it's only with yourself!" these women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. perhaps if little edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time things didn't work out, losing her hair, her job, and the love of her life, she would have made it. this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness: her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead. the world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's plea, "come home, edie! let me take care of you!"yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking, and lovable, even in their extremely filthy home. these women were extraordinary, and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness. when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns, dwelling about what could have been, or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl, one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that "everything will be okay!" great documentary!!9/10

grey gardens is a world unto itself. edith and little edie live in near total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. cats loll about while mother edith insults her daughter's elocution. this is a tennessee williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights, as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real.the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade (other than that they were poor and clean). they would bicker all day, grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men, work, and self-expression.this film is a must-see for anyone writing a mother/daughter relationship of this kind. it is sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly. it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context--remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion.

i first saw this movie in my plays & playwrights course at tulane. i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude. the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core. **as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming, little edie became infatuated with one of the camera men.** the beauty, i find, comes from the naturalness of the family's dysfunction. it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little edie's rehabilitation to society. in all, the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it's portrayal of surprising beauty. two thumbs way up!

grey gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away. it was so strange, and funny and sad and sick and .. really no words can describe. the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre. i found out about this film reading my uncle john's great big bathroom reader, by the bathroom reader's institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue. this movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed. one should watch it for their favorite edie outfits, which i am sure include curtains. when i get old i almost wish to be just like big edie, thumbing my nose at normalcy and society.

i knew about but had never seen grey gardens, before i saw the broadway musical of the same name. friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie, the musical would not make sense. it did, but it also prompted me to rent the movie. at first, i thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, shrieking characters, and it was exceedingly hard to watch. but being able to stop it, digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary. both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing. both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age. they have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you re- examine your own dealings with your mother. in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace, it's fascinating to see the mayleses' work from three decades ago, and realize what an impact the film must have had.i echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family? but beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion? or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track, which gave me additional insight into the film.

fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale (big edie) and her daughter (little edie) aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis. they live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. the content is pretty much made up of two things. the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. these discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.

grey gardens is shocking, amusing, sad and mesmerizing. i watched in amazement as ediths jr. and sr. bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past. their existence in a dilapidated mansion, (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. this is a film you will not soon forget.

i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales, a true aristocratic family. it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. the money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate. wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. unforgettable.

excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies. they couldn't live together, nor apart. babbling constantly, sometimes at the same time, they hashed and re-hashed the past; going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda. i found myself laughing at times, but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were. see this one.

why should you watch this? there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it! superbly and amusingly directed by albert and david maysles, grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of east hampton, but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith bouvier beales, the aunt and cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis. their life was certainly an amusing one (edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas, edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats, one was named ted z. kennedy) the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad - edith died shortly after the film was released (in february 1977) aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film (she danced and sang in a nightclub edie beale jr was born in 1925 and is still living in miami beach.this film is both engaging and spellbounding.

the daughter's words are poetry: "i can't go on another year. i got to get to a hotel room." "i lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves." "the marble faun is moving in...he just gave us a washing machine. that's the deal." "i'm pulverized by this latest thing." "..raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time." "..any little rat's nest, mouse hole i'd like better." and there is wisdom in the mother's words: "...yes the pleasure is all mine." "this little book will keep me straight, straight as a dye." "always one must do everything correctly." "where the hell did you come from?" "...bring me my little radio i've got to have some professional music." "i'm your mother. remember me?" the mother/daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film. this is a mother's day film.

this is why i so love this website ! i saw this film in the 1980's on british television. over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life. with barely a few key words to remember it by, i traced the film here, and much information, including the fact it's about to become an off-broadway musical !interestingly, unlike the previous comment maker, i do not remember finding this film sad, or exploitative. on the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honour and dignity. ironic you may think, considering the squalor of their lives. maybe it's because i live in britain, where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money, where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit, deep and profound humour, whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect. in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult'. over the years, as it faded in my mind, it shone the brightest, above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience. it was such a deeply private expose, it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical. but perhaps somewhere, the daughter will be amused by such an outcome. it is she who will have the last laugh maybe..(they made a musical out of her before you jackie o' )

i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of jackie o too; people just don't talk like that anymore. i think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, old edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't she see the once spectacular home disintegrating? yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life tennesse williams one act. well worth your time.

several years ago when i first watched "grey gardens" i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp. years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it, but after many viewings i've come to see the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable "big" edith bouvier beale and her daughter "little" edith bouvier beale.mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term "shabby chic". with innumerable cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o. allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day. the result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule.the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. and their lives an example of drive, determination and free-will. this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words. it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself.

this documentary follows the lives of big and little edie beale, a mother and daughter, who lived as recluses in their family mansion in east hampton, ny from the mid-50s through the late 70s. by the time the filmmakers find them, the mansion is falling apart, and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share a squalid room. the older edie beale is the aunt of jackie kennedy onassis and the younger is her first cousin. the women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition, but jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there.at times this movie can seem exploitative, as neither woman seems in the best of mental health, but at other times, the movie is hard to look away from. "little" edie blames her mother for her current state, and her mother fires back that edie was never going to be the success she thought she was. "little" edie often seems trapped in the past, focused on choices she made decades ago, and loves showing off pictures from her youth, where she clearly was a beautiful debutante. her mother seems more resigned to her fate, to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions. there are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead, from the pictures that show a happy family, to the grand portrait of the older edie next to her bed. from what we see of the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls are cracking and falling apart, and "little" edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on. and of course there are numerous cats running around.at its heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. while neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life, the squalor they live in is utterly awful. it's not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house, and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family.however, as a documentary, the film is a wonder to behold, and is highly recommended.

i saw this film a couple of weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary. to get the true story of the beales, i had to wade through all of the dvd's bonus material and commentaries and search the web.although the maysles and their fans (not to mention edith and edie themselves) bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative, this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word. very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in - the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous. the sound, even on the criterion re-release is poor and difficult to follow. although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film, it's ironic to compare it to geraldo rivera's (!) far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from 1972, four years before grey gardens was shot.to paraphrase a review in the new yorker, there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives, and a documentary wasn't one of them.as for edith and edie, the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was "where the hell is their family"? they were living in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe conditions. how is it that jackie o, married to one of the richest men on earth (or the wealthy bouvier family themselves) couldn't afford to get edith and edie a decent home? or at the very least hire a part-time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both? it's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier family.although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries. perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary - bringing in the rich backstory (and afterstory) of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the 1970's.

hey now, yours truly, theatrex, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a "cult hit" so of course it came home with me. what a strange film. the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on long island (suffolk co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. suffolk co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right. anyway, this is one strange pair, big edie and little edie...edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. big edie (the mother, age 79) apparently likes to run around naked, and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that. these women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, except to them. they live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever ("look, that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!"), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. if i close my eyes and listen to big edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt, who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent. one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. the box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and i'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for "wacked out of their gourds", but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. this is equal parts creepy, sad, and disgusting, but i couldn't stop watching once i started. this is not my "normal" type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating. it won't be for everybody though, guaranteed.

i found grey garden's to be a gripping film, an amazingly intimatelook at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea: forgetsociety and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a hugebrood of cats and raccoons, persuing their own interests rathermundainly, all the while chattering at the camera.big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros.have chosen to document. they seem like characters out of afellini film, only stranger, if that makes any sense. old edie isalmost fully bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishesgrowing around her. little edie is even more interesting. sheprances around the house, always wearing a baboushka-likeheaddress around her head, completely covering her hair. wenever see her hair throughout the film, nor do we ever get a hintthat she still has much. at age fifty eight, though, she is stillbeautiful and full of life.in grey gardens, we get the sense that both of these women'slives have become much less than what they once were. littleedie is probably the sadder of the two. while her mother, in herearlier years, got married, made a family, lived luxuriously andeven made some recordings (the scene where, at 77, she singsalong with a recording of "tea for two" she made decades ago isone of the films best scenes), edie left her promicing career as amodel to take care of her ailing mother. at 58, she still longed tofind her prince charming. if anything little edie is still a little girl,full of dreams of glamour and fame, and of domestic and romanticbliss, that have yet to be fulfilled.highlights of the film include the opening moments, where littleedie explains her outfit to the camera, the "tea for two" sequence,the birthday party, the climactic argument, the grocery deliverscene, and the scene in the attic. the whole thing is incrediblycandid and unpretencious. and it's made all the more remarcablesince it's all real.i suggest seeing grey gardens back-to-back with the kennethanger short puce moment. the criterion dvd is $35.00, but it'sworth every penny.

'grey gardens'(1975) is the maysles' brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on east hampton, long island.'big edie' bouvier beale,78,witty and dry and her daughter, 'little edie' beale,56,(emotionally about 13) a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future,live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic. they amuse themselves by bickering all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other(they dont even own a television) their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special, although obviously, dysfunctional people.one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.

one question that must be asked immediately is: would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassis?the answer is: probably not.but, thankfully, they are (or were) the cousin and aunt of jackie.this documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence (one could hardly call it a life) of edith b. beale, jr., and her daughter edith bouvier beale (edie), has the same appeal of a train wreck -- you don't want to look but you have to.big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton, new york, that is slowly decaying around them. the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle.magnificent oil painting lean against the wall (with cat feces on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines.living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others.clothing is seems to be optional. edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head.as edith says "edie is still beautiful at 56." and indeed she is. there are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there.there is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension.their eating habits are (to be polite) strange. ice cream spread on crackers. a dinner party for edith's birthday of wonder bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils.time is irrelevant in their world; as edie says "i don't have any clocks."their relationships with men are oh-so-strange.edie feels like edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness. she says "if you can't get a man to propose to you, you might as well be dead." to which edith replies "i'll take a dog any day."it is obvious that edith doesn't see her role in edie's lack of male companionship. early in the film she states "france fell but edie didn't.sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said. both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other.there is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film; edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with wonder bread and cat food. the cats (and there are many of them) are everywhere.at one point edie declares "the hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility." but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves.this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort.

i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not, this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. i kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the edies do their thing, i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong. very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it, but very disturbing.

we stumbled upon the documentary, grey gardens, last sunday and got "sucked in" without warning. everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "i thrive on it [the smell]." we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. spellbinding! a must see!!!!

i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid, and, naturally, was moved to tears by this story of a fox family. the fantastic scenery at hokkaidô, the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists. i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack. to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa-dubbing is the only one worth listening to. i taped both (defa and br) but i keep viewing the first one only.

glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made.the film makes you care about each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic. set against an inhospitable countryside, the audience's hearts warm to the family members.the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms.man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human endeavours.

i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old - i bugged my parents to take me back three times. i began looking for it on video about five years ago, finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site, but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased (i understand the original video run was small), or have the rights purchased by the family channel, disney, etc. and shown regularly. it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan, narrated by a wise old tree. the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well. it would be a good seller today, better than many of the weak offerings to children's movies today.

i have been looking for this movie for so many years. i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie. i called disney all the movie stores and the net. no luck. what a waste it was a very good movie. it will be missed:(

i saw this movie when i was little - it was called "glacier fox". i was totally traumatized by it! it follows a cute little fox family around. the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes. i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics. i won't tell you what happened, but let's just say it doesn't end well for all of the foxes. i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don't really die. oh man. this movie made me cry for hours. it was a good movie...i think - i was really little and truth be told -all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die. rent it if you can, but don't show your kids!

i recommend families if possible,to show this to older children only.some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle.now that thats out of the way,let me explain about this movie.this is in reality a documentary of a male fox,who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate.the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score,is breath taking.you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible,it'll get ugly later.they gave both the fox and the vixen names,but i can't remember what they are for the likes of me.he fights off this invading male,to win her love.they later on create a den,and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind.there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family,but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon.the first victim is the blind pup,who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away.the second victim is the mother,who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole.she unknowingly walks into a foot trap.while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot,causing her to bleed to death.the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree.the male is now a single dad,forced to take on the roll of mom and dad.he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life.it later proves not to be enough,when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man.i won't spoil the surprising ending for you,but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail.and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through.i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early 1980s, when we had a thing called showbiz cable.i was only 4 when i saw it,but i could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it.now i know why,after i secretly watched it when it came on disney,when i was 9.i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on.i was moved to tears.but as dark and ugly as it was,it serves a purpose.to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals,and why they are endangered.this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species,and i hoped it worked.its not fake like the true life nature films by disney,they don't teach about why animals are going extinct.the encroachment of land,the killing off of the foxes main prey,and senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered.i wish they would make sequel to this movie,(glacier fox 2005)to see if they're being treated better.maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up.this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes,especially when one of the parents suddenly dies.the surviving parent takes on the roll of both,and tries to teach the important lessons of life.it isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults,especially when some of their lives becomes ruined.or they fall victims to tragedy themselves.best all around soundtrack and musical score i've ever heard.

this is an excellent show! i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this. there are many "facts" in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well, in a way that is unforgettable.mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students. use of live actors performing "skits" is also very entertaining. i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down.

this was one of the funniest and informative shows that i have ever seen. this is a must see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning. i don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that mr wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. if mr wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the georgia dome to hold all the people who will want to see it. i agree with the idea of making this a hbo series. it would have an amazing following

i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this. but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is. this hbo special features him teaching "american history" to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal. he poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the u.s. but some other parts of the world. this documentary/comedy was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really true.i enjoyed how mr. wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting. i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his/her beliefs.

i recently watched this, but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about, what the topic was.....in short - i had no idea what it was. was it a documentary, was it a comedy routine.....well, it was both.it started a little slow, but i think that's because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing. but it quickly sucked me in. the episode i watched had robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history. mainly how we (american's) learn history that isn't really true - and how we got to learn what we did. he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained, and interested. i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be.i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo. i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same type of manner as this episode.

robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan, new york.he covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known. i would like to see much more of this show. it is very entertaining. mr. wuhl uses examples and "show and tell" to get his points across. he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere! henry wadsworth longfellow used revere's name because it sounded better.i've watched robert wuhl for many years, from the time he was doing stand-up comedy and all the way through "arli$$" on hbo. he's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he's an excellent teacher! i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show. it is well worth your time.

i went and saw rivers and tides again today. it's the second time in two days and yes, i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary. yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy's works. this morning when i threw the coins i received #29 the abysmal (water). goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. i received the 5th line changing which moved to #7 the army. to blake art was a war. anyway, i knew i had to see the film again.i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner. the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film. he'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack. so i was aware of that as i watched this second time.yesterday i thought that i'd vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world. well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say. could i enjoy the film without his comments? what he is doing, what he is saying goes way beyond "art". his understanding of water, time, stone, change, and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar. some of his work/words are zen like. his knowledge...anyway, the film is only (apparently) being shown here in the bay area. be a trend setter. go to your local cinema and tell them, no insist that they have to book a film you've heard about from the hinter lands. it's called rivers and tides.

as a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. my post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.i also keep healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in california and nearby states like utah, arizona, and nevada. jogging, walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.within that background, i was obsessed with rivers and tides. i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of director/cinematographer thomas riedelsheimer. i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of riedelsheimer.wonderful. wonderful. wonderful.

so, not being a poet myself, i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. the effortless motion of goldsworthy, as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating. watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work, and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot. be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web.the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself. it is in the essential change of nature where his work, though complete in its own sphere, is made whole.

this film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity. an artist's profound vision, his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring hosanna, blending his creations with trees, white water dashing against rocks, fields and rain...andy goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive, aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth. he doesn't spare us his occasional frustration, but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature. credit also goes of course to the filmmaker, thomas riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing.if you have any feeling for beauty, nature and art...do not miss this fantastic film!

go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthy's sculptures, and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience. the music perfectly complements the footage, but never draws attention towards itself. some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot, but consider this: why would you expand on this in a movie, if you can read andy's musings at length in his books, or attend one of his excellent lectures? this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works, and is used expertly in this respect.

a new way to enjoy goldsworthy's work, rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion. watching goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. although, i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), i do feel it was a bit long. the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy's work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.

right at this moment i am watching this movie for the second time (on television) and for the second time i fell into it when it was running for an hour already (i think i saw 2 minutes more this time) this movie is really impressing, the way goldsworthy looks at nature, changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of, really is amazing. this whole movie gives you a warm feeling, seeing him play with the world around him with such love. or only seeing his hands, covered in dirt and with broken fingernails, it just touches you.

this movie is probably for you. it had an overall meditative quality from the music, to the beautiful photography, and listening to the often cliché things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots. if you're familiar with buddhism- that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film. the impermanence of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. however, what i did not understand, confused, and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing (i saw over an hour of it) was the redundancy of the whole thing. you only find out bits and pieces of why he's commissioned, and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work. the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends.

i first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that i bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. the bottom line:none of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!). this stellar film is about scottish conceptual artist, andy goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). we get to see goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. german film maker,thomas riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by fred frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). although this film has been available on dvd for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). no mpaa rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)

this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that i've ever seen on screen. andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction. he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it's primitive in a good sense. his purity, honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art. i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes prematurely, but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly. the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthy's art has. it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. fred frith's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound. this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect. it has no boundaries as far as age goes.

this film is stunningly beautiful. goldsworthy's art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful, moving and changing and blossoming. i strongly recommend this movie to everyone. i can think of nothing else to say about it. it's just the kind of movie you have to see, because it's so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre.

a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy, whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature. his work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. thus, most of goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. now, one can argue that goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland (of course, i'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial).

the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks, assembling rocks into egg-shaped cairns, filling riverside rock-pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns. an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery (near where i live), but although i found these pieces intriguing, i only realised the wonder of goldsworthy's work when i was lucky enough to catch a re-screening of rivers and tides.thomas reidelsheimer's film, accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith, brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work. the opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake-like thread set atop a tree-stump. working with his teeth and bare hands, goldsworthy crafts a beautiful, ephemeral work. before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight. this scene is among the most beautiful in the film, but the breadth and inventiveness of goldsworthy's work is remarkable. reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures, capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine, even if for just a few hours, minutes or seconds.goldsworthy himself provides the narration, speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work. he makes plain his need to work with nature, to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials, even when they seem to be working against him. at times he is down-to-earth and humorous; at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose  something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand. the 'rivers and tides' of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artist's hands, flowing from one form to the next. the capture of the creation and dissolution of goldworthy's work is in itself a striking piece of art.although goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across north america and europe, the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting; it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that i get when i spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new. a brief interval in which we are introduced to andy's family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks. nevertheless, reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing goldsworthy and his creations, locating them in their wider environments, from meandering canadian rivers to rainy scottish hillsides. fittingly, the film ends with goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky. fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air; this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist.

the filmmaker inhaled andy goldsworthy's art, his search for closeness with the land and the water, and his sense of proportion -- and so gently, so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us. "rivers and tides" loves goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that hides its power in plain sight. see this movie!

being a fan of andy goldsworthy's art for a while now, and owning some of his books, i had some expectations of what i would see. what i got was something completely satisfying, and quite a bit more than i expected. being an artist myself (i work in clay), finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative, and it is something andy goldsworthy has mastered. following him over the course of a year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, skill, and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair. the music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating. if you are an artist in need of inspiration, or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience, then see this movie. i for one am glad to know that andy is somewhere out there. creating, dancing, wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.

this german documentary, in english, is about a scottish environmental sculptor named andy goldsworthy. he makes art from objects he finds in nature. for example, early in the film we see him taking sections of icicles and "gluing" them together with a little moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly go through a vertical rock.of course, the icicles melt, but that transience is a part of most of goldsworthy's work. he goes to a site and gets a feeling for it, deciding intuitively what to make that day. he talks of having a "dialog" with the rocks and other materials that he works with, attempting to work *with* rather than against them. it might be stones, or flowers, or leaves, or sticks. the sculpture might last for minutes or years, or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed. the work seems to be more of a process than a goal.the film, and the work, is beautiful, inspiring, and thought provoking. it moves pretty slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night's sleep. but do go if you have the opportunity.search the web for some other pages about andy goldsworthy or to read about his local sculpture at stanford university. there are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures.my thoughts: skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently. i recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which i thought i would share for those of you still reading. first, the transitory nature of much of andy goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. we're born, we live, and eventually we die. that's natural, and that's also naturally a part of goldsworthy's art.the other thought was to be awestruck with the way that goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life. most of us have work which is tolerated at best, a life which we hardly notice living, and passions which we really mean to spend more time on, if we even remember what they are. andy goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well, and is nourishing for him and those around him. wow.seen on 8/28/2002.

andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order, expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art. indeed, time and change is what his work is fundamentally about. i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times. so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film, he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect, and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all. he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone (if they do anymore), creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it. mr. goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature, and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways. and always with the utmost respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering, and wondering monk.

as the jacket proclaims, this film is "gorgeously shot and masterfully edited," and, yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful. the timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from goldsworthy's hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity.and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in--or in the words of matthew arnold from "dover beach":listen! you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling, at their return, up the high strand, begin, and cease, and then again begin, with tremulous cadence slow, and bring the eternal note of sadness in.at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that "words do their job, but what i'm doing here says a lot more." as a wordsmith myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates, is indeed something more than mere words can say.at another point he remarks on "what is here to stay...and what isn't." that is his theme.i think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral. the idea was, that by emphasizing how short-lived are even the mightiest works of humans, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed.perhaps part of the effectiveness of goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression. he painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it, or places it in the river where it will be swept away; and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality.both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it. and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural. thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity, but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along.this is art as art should be, akin to the spiritual.in a sense goldsworthy's work is an inarticulated understanding. it is an experience purely of time and form. in a sense his work "answers" shelley's famous poem "ozymandias" by saying, even as the tide washes the work away, and even as the river dissipates the expression, even so the art lives on because of our experience of it. similarly one thinks of tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out, and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished, they are given to the wind, so that we might know that all is flux.yet, in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos. goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer (of necessity i would say) and all his works, even the unsuccessful ones, he tells us, are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not.this cinematic production directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed. it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual.

greetings again from the darkness. insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. how strange for most of us to see someone who must work... no matter the conditions, else his reason for living ceases. to see goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic. this artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. it is his lifeforce. when you see his failures, energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon. it is not the dread of beginning again, it is that he takes his energy from his work. watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful, but nonetheless, breathtaking. he discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same. when he says he needs the earth, but it does not need him ... i beg to differ. only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best.

on one level, this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again. on a deeper level though, it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land. i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said, "when i'm not out here (alone) for any length of time, i feel unrooted."i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists. i'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee-table books and a couple art gallery installations. but to see his work in motion, captured perfectly through riedelsheimer's lens, was a revelation. unfrozen in time, goldsworthy's creations come alive, swirling, flying, dissolving, crumbling, crashing.and that's precisely what he's all about: time. the process of creation and destruction. of emergence and disappearing. of coming out of the void and becoming the universe, and back again. there's a shamanic quality about him, verging on madness. you get the feeling, watching him at work, that his art is a lifeforce for him, that if he didn't do it, he would whither and perish.luckily for us, goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography. otherwise, with the exception of a few cairns and walls, they would only exist for one person.

i admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film i wasn't entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing. like many other people, i found it pretty boring, and i wasn't entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together. however, if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product, you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is. i really think it's sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists. rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy, who makes his art entirely out of things in nature, generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy. it is slow moving and unglamorous, but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthy's art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated. i've even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie, rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves, which i just think is madness.on the other hand, lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them. a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics, i guess i'm just the kind of person that believes that i'd like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork. i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do. i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie. he does, after all, lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion, but if you don't want goldsworthy talk about his art while you're watching the film, feel free to turn the sound off. that's like not reading the lyrics if you don't want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself.i think that andy goldsworthy's work, which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie, is incredibly impressive, and i'm glad that this film was made in order to showcase it. indeed, since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio, photography is the only medium other than film that can express it, and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art, and the way that only things from nature are used. whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented, goldsworthy's work is moving enough to overlook that, because the film is not the star, goldsworthy's art is. and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow-moving nature of the film, it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that.

having seen charley boorman in long way round with ewan mcgregor, i was very interested to see how charley would be in his own show. i thought charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth. its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness, it just show's their human too! i don't know a lot about bikes, but this show gripped me right from the start. the preparation and organising for this event seems immense. the event itself seems very dangerous and i'm fascinated to see why charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets. i love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music. i can't believe he broke his collar bone, i really hope its not the end, i cant wait to see the next episode...

the planning episodes were a bit dull, but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch. the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because, much to my surprise,charley fell out of the race relatively early. when his hands were sore, i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix, but instead he actually quit the race. the most anxious moment of the show must've been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food! the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it. overall, not as great as the long way round, but definitely an interesting watch, as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world.

i always follow the dakar, so when my husband bought charlie's 'race to dakar' dvd home i couldn't wait to watch it! of course we'd seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on, but that never gives the background and specific teams.if you watched long way round then you won't be surprised by the language which frankly i find more amusing than offensive.i think the only thing that annoyed me about the dvd was charlie's hair, but he had it styled before dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged; tho' i could have lived without the 'flame' undies lol as with lwr, the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself. i nearly cried when charlie broke his hand, and winced at every bruise he sustained while training....and of course the death of andy caldicott...that was an appalling tragedy, but then every year there's something.russ drives me nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in lwr. it's great to see him get along so well now with charlie.what i learned from this odyssey was - 1. never let scorpion prepare your vehicle for anything! - they had months to prepare the x5, and still the day before the team left for lisbon, scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done, and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race; 2. the dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider/driver retrieval plan - leaving matt (and presumably a large number of other riders/drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence; 3. charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for 'rough and tough' adventure but needs to toughen up a lot to really perform as he'd like; and finally, 4. charlie and ewan are planning another of these epos called the long way down in 2007, and i can't wait to get my hands on it! :d if you love bikes and/or genuinely nice blokes 'having a go', you have to watch this, i guarantee you love it. it's very entertaining.in conclusion, to simon pavey - you sir are a hero, i was so impressed by the your 'quiet achiever' manner and the fact that you actually finished.....just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is. and to charlie, matt and the rest of the team - full marks for pulling it off. to think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable. you're all wonderful.

if you loved long way round you will enjoy this nearly as much. it is educational, funny, interesting and tense. charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much russ. ewan makes a few appearances but charley really pulls it off alone. he is funny, engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt. great stuff!the series wraps up in 7 episodes. like lwr, the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race. though they cover the ins and outs of the race well, there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars, which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing. it is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this. the series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths. yikes. there is another extremely catchy theme song like lwr but this one is not nearly as good as the stereophonics.if you live in the us god knows when it will be released so buy it on amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as i did. oh, and be prepared to buy another motorbike.

i loved long way round and wasn't even aware of race to dakar until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. i bought it and after a slightly 'hmm will this be as good' first episode i decided that it was. charlie boorman was great as were the other members of the crew. great to see him with ewan again. there was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didn't bother me. as for their being no mention of it on the package. thats more to do with the silly excempt from classification certificate that the bbfc have. they should have given it a 15 just for the language alone.highly recommended series, i want more!!

"jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines". --- it is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book. please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness. the reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned. please read the book as is it a great source of information. i enjoyed it a lot. this book is even a taught as a text book at some universities.

this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent opus, *collapse*.diamond himself comes off as personable and caring, not just a disinterested or disengaged academic. this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to "publish or perish," as the saying goes about academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects, "why you white people got so much cargo, and we have so little?" because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community. i like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "south park's" "blame canada": "blame wheat!"

having read diamond's book, i was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'western civilization' under every rug.is diamond a little preachy ? sure. like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. he uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. we get it, after about the first 10 minutes.is diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? sure. the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes. but the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the spaniard's success against the established cultures.is he preaching *against* western civilization in any way ? nope. not a word. not to my ear. all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.in the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.

this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel more4 and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking. i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary. basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth's societies prospered and others did not. the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one. as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re-created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary. diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses. people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist. it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion. highly recommended viewing.

the documentary presents an original theory about "guns, germs and steel". the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defend the theory against common criticism.i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series. they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school. indeed, it does. in fact, i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis.so, if you like knowing why things work, if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked, if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this series. a definite recommendation.

don't know if this contains any spoilers or not, but i don't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462.i disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described *guns, germs and steel* as "politically correct" and "neo-marxist." they cannot have watched the same series that *i* did.the series *i* watched depicted the history of european colonisation in the americas and southern africa with no particular inaccuracies. i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, though europeans often *were* lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck. neither did i see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. if anything, the inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power. i certainly saw nothing that could be construed as marxist or neo-marxist, except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations.otherwise, many african peoples *do* have a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that europeans lack. at the time they were at the height of their successes, the aztec, maya and inca civilisations *were* as advanced as any other in the world - and as wealthy; sometimes more so. aboriginal american and khoi-san populations *were* decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by europeans; just as european colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (note: the khoi-san peoples are completely different from all other sub-saharan african peoples.) so, i don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. the only thing *i* can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything i did not know by the time i finished seventh grade. there's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film. it does, however, present some nice dramatisations of events, such as the conquest of the incas; the production values are very high; and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn't get covered in mrs. gruber's sixth hour social studies class at milan middle school.if you rent or buy this, assuming you had a decent primary and/or secondary school education, you won't learn anything new, but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned (or should have learned) by the time you hit high school.

this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle. he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s-1960s that he sold with gimmicks. in "13 ghosts" you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the film was in b&w). "the tingler" had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre. "marabre" issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death! the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them. in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle, actors in his movies and his daughter. it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was (by all accounts he was a great guy). the documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely riveting. it's very short (under 90 minutes) and there's never a dull moment. a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans. my one complaint--there were very few sequences shown from his pictures. that aside this is just great.

i was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the maryland film festival. i've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of william castle, so this was definitely a must-see for me.this is about the life and work of william castle, who in my opinion was an underrated director. true, he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films, but he added something to these films: real live theater gimmicks that you don't see anymore. for example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators at the bottoms of chairs in the tingler.this is truly a well-made documentary and brings this rather shadowed director into the light, and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema. it also paints castle as a larger than life character, who was very well-liked and had a smile on his face.unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians, spine tingler! shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work, such as john waters, john landis, and joe dante. a must see for classic horror and sci-fi fans.

i gave it a 10, since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to. the reason i'm troubling you is to add a personal observation on castle's work.i've seen "homicidal" and "the tingler" (the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white) a few times and "the house on haunted hill" many times.even i am not old enough to have seen them when castle was up to his showman tricks, thus i can appreciate them for their own merit. and while most pass him off as second-rate, schlocky, hammy, etc., i believe they do him a disservice.the end sequence of "homicidal" is genuinely shocking and works today - and the premise of "the tingler" while silly, was highly original.but "the house on haunted hill" was a triumph. having used that frank lloyd wright house as its exterior, the great vincent price and a solid cast, plus a good score and production values - when i first saw it at a packed late-night showing in the late sixties, it produced an audience reaction i'd not seen before and have not seen since.it was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you've not seen the film, stop reading now) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall.with no telegraphing of what is coming, the camera slowly pulls back, forcing the audience to switch their gaze to... i'm saying no more (my "spoiler" declaration above only covers this movie).the point is, i believe this ploy was deliberate - not accidental - and when it happened, the whole audience screamed (including most of the men!) it took the audience about ten minutes to calm down.now that is superior film-making. a flamboyant showman he might have been, but "house" and the other two films i've mentioned were good movies. castle may not have been a hitchcock, but he was no ed wood, either.it's easy to concentrate on someone's quirks and forget to examine their talent. so i hope this documentary acknowledged that. i look forward to seeing it.

william castle is notorious among horror fans as the b-grade director of the 1950s and 60s. his gimmicks, his cost-cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary. it comes as no surprise, then, that someone (jeffrey schwarz, who's made countless documentaries) would finally take the time to devote a documentary to his greatness. such is "spine tingler: the william castle story".i had a general understanding of who castle was, having seen some of his films over the years. i knew nothing about her personal life, his goals and ambitions. this film really fleshed out the man and gave me a fuller appreciation for the devotion he had for the craft of film-making and his contributions to the horror genre. the movie depicts castle as rival to alfred hitchcock, with hitch being the artist who wins praise while castle is the carnival barker who gains cult notoriety, but much less respect. he is an icon to all second-rate directors out there, which is why it's not surprising that john waters is featured prominently in here. (joe dante and stuart gordon also have sizable roles.) his gimmicks were what drove his fame, and the documentary takes great pains to explain them, which is crucial for those who are too young to remember. the rudimentary 3-d of "13 ghosts" (see separate review), the buzzer in the seat for "the tingler" (see separate review), money back guarantees for "homicidal"... watching these films now outside the theater, we can judge them for their content (which, personally, i still enjoy) but we cannot fully appreciate what audiences once felt.the climax of the film is when castle goes from cult director to hollywood producer. having bought the rights to "rosemary's baby", he is put in a very special place for negotiating its film release. hoping to direct, he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director roman polanski. while at first disappointed, this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime -- a hugely successful film, and a job he excels at. who better to control the purse of wild artist polanski than a penny-pinching castle? this was to be his crowning achievement, though sadly the film is more often connected to polanski than castle.the remainder of his years are played out, and we are given personal reflections by his daughter and niece. across the board, everyone seems to have nothing but praise for the man. somewhere along the way, he surely upset one or two people, but you would never know it from this film. and i find that find -- this is a celebration of bill castle's life, not "e! true hollywood story". fans of the genre would do well to pick up a copy of this work.i would personally recommend picking up the william castle collection, which has not only this but eight of castle's films in it, with plenty of special features. even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how schwarz was personally affected by castle, and have castle's daughter terry giving a running reflection of her experiences with the different films and remakes. it's almost a whole new film.

this documentary on schlockmeister william castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive '50s-'60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work--look at the funny, silly people with the ghost-glasses--but it's also affectionate and lively, with particularly bright commentary from john waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and from castle's daughter, who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft. (we never find out what became of the other castle offspring.) the movies were not very good, it makes clear, but his marketing of them was brilliant, and he appears to have been a sweet, hardworking family man. fun people keep popping up, like "straight jacket"'s diane baker, who looks great, and anne helm, whom she replaced at the instigation of star joan crawford. darryl hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with castle on "the tingler," and there's enough footage to give us an idea of the level of castle's talent--not very high, but very energetic. a pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased, and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie-going days.

i really enjoyed this documentary about kenny and spencer's attempt to pitch "the dawn". was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big. the story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well. certainly worth a watch. my only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure. perhaps that is part of the point. we expect it but in reality that is not what happened (or usually happens).the film is also a great way to see the personality of kenny and spencer outside of their canadian television show. you can see a bit of what is yet to come. i look forward to a chance to see the papal chase.

an hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script. documentary hits all the beats, plot points, character arcs, seductions, moments of elation and disappointments and the allure but insane prospect of selling a script or getting an agent in hollywood;and all the fleeting, fantasy-realizing but ultimately empty rites of passage attendant to being socialized into "the system." hotz and rice capture the moment of thinking you're finally a player, only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind-siding fashion;that for inexplicable reasons, hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart, your dreams, and your pockets. pitch is a must-see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego-bashing gantlet that is, for most, the road that must be traveled to sell oneself and one's projects in hollywood. if your teacher or guru has never been there, they can't tell you what you need to prepare for this gantlet. to enter the"biz," talent is necessary but far from sufficient

credited by variety to be one of the greatest documentaries to ever come out of canada. al pacino, roger ebert, neil simon, matt dillon as well as a constant slew of celebs make this film a canadian classic. the film is really best described as "roger & me" meets "the player". watch as kenny hotz and spenny pitch their script to the big boys of hollywood. called the only american film to ever come out of canada, this film opened the toronto film festival in 1997, winner of the 'best indie film award toronto'. europe premier was at the prestigious hof film fest in germany. u.s.a. premier u.s. comedy festival aspen 1999. more information available at www.kennyhotz.com

this film is exactly what its title describes--an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer.first, it's kinda fun to see the 1996-style toronto i remember with all its silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes, and attitude. it really hasn't changed any; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types! it's also amusing to see kenny and spenny head to l.a. and find out that it's toronto all over again, only with a strange assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers, and yet more uppity film types.i don't see pitch as a film to be enjoyed; it's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone's aspirations being trampled. i take pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses. would-be (and "successful") writers, musicians, and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the big time.so, kenny and spenny are trying to sell you a warning. buy it or don't, but the message is still there.

tintin and i recently aired as an episode of pbs's p.o.v. series. it's based on a taped interview of georges remi a.k.a. herge, tintin's creator, from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character, first in a catholic newspaper, then in his own series of comic books. awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of herge's dreams. i first encountered tintin in the pages of children's digest at my local elementary school library reading the secrets of the unicorn. my mom later got a subscription to cd and i read the entire red rackham's treasure every month in 1978. i remember seeing some tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason i didn't get any probably because i was 12 and i thought i was outgrowing them. i do have breaking free, a book written and drawn by j. daniels, published in 1989, six years after herge's death. haven't read it yet. this film also covers the artist's personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ (whom he later married). her name is fanny and she is interviewed here. if you love tintin and his creator, this film is definitely worth a look. update: 9/4/07-i've now read breaking free. tintin and the captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of mr. daniels with tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for the captain who he's staying with. the captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly. they and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident. the whole thing takes place in england with working-class cockney accents intact. not the kind of thing herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless. oh, yes, dog snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover (which has tintin running over the police!) and the dedication page.

some thirty years ago, author numa sadoul published a book length interview with the belgian comic book artist georges remi (better known as herge, the creator of tintin). this movie catches up with sadoul today as he recalls the interview, while we listen to the cassettes (herge died in 1983) and see some old photos and footage of the man himself. some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of herge, and we now know these dealt with his separation from his wife, after he had an affair with one of his collaborators (who years later would become his second wife). an interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the tintin books from the early rightist and imperialist books (tintin in the congo, tintin in the lands of the soviets) to fairly anti-imperialist books just a few years later (the blue lotus). on the whole, i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater.

this is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of herge and his creating tintin. its based around a series of interviews conducted in 1971, and covers every thing from his early life and "nazi collaboration" to the final moments of his life.brilliantly edited, very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring. this film will give you a new appreciation for the work of herge.the film makers make the film more than just another documentary. using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good use.recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas. but this one as to be amongst the best...

if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about hergé and his life creating tintin. i'ts so brilliant and a very cool production. the whole background story about hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is amazing. there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this. i will for sure be in my basement digging up the tintin albums again. also, the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it. i really do hope people will find this as intriguing as i did!

"tintin and i" first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary. the photography and the editing are truly breath-taking (almost anti-dogma).we follow the life of tintin drawer hergé through an open-hearted interview from 1971. the tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century. in the midst of these hergé has his own demons to fight with, and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection.even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums, the story of hergé is told entirely through interviews and archive material, and never through reconstructions.hergé lived the turbulent life of a true, suffering artist. but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.

imagine that i was about to miss this great cultural event on swedish tv last night, and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the tv on (to make it easier for her to fall asleep!) that i came across it (yes i had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an 'early night'...).anyway - this must surely be a rather unusual idea - to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago. but with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the 20th centuries' most appreciated literary artists - georges remy a.k.a hergé.i for sure will read my tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this film, which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in hergé's life (and i can tell you that i will a.s.a.p get the few that i don't have). of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years that i have already been reading them, as has my view about what albums are my favourites, but this adds (at least) one more dimension to them.

tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid. i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got. my favorite one was "the red sea sharks" - so much action and humor.this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin. the film-maker's personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving.a great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist. a great example of someone who has become internationally renown, and has brought joy of millions of children (and the young at heart) all over the world.

this might contain a spoiler, so beware.if it had been 200,000 thousand or two million people, does it make a difference? sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of (strangely very loud) americans, but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone. god help us for what we have done. after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans, and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race, you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's. but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us. how then, can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will? we are contradictory and hypocritical, and i am ashamed for this. i feel sorrow for the people affected. they deserve justice and their homes back. if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety, i don't want it. i denounce these actions, and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit. no one is above the law. i want my country back, and so do the chagos islanders. regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers, no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports. we can't stand to be stuck in traffic, let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes. 'not one of us, brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around. don't buy into the fallacy that a simpler, more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed, and preserved - when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000, we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men.

this documentary explores a story covered in pilger's latest book "freedom next time", which was published in 2006. it reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of diego garcia, one of the chagos islands in the indian ocean.the islanders are technically british citizens, as diego garcia is a british colony, much like mauritius, the nearby island to where the natives were exiled, used to be. but the british government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the united states army, who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistan.as usual, pilger's coverage is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. his interviews all round are excellent, and his cornering of a parliament representative where he uses the government's own information to pin him down, ranks as one of his best.pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the british conspiracy to evict the natives. the weaving of this footage with the interviews, and the islanders music, really heightens the film's impact.it is not easy viewing, but "stealing a nation" is john pilger at his best. recommended.

the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. as an american, i am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. we suck. this is probably the first john pilger documentary i've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done. my only complaint, and the reason i gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help. i don't know about britain, but america's made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government's doings. a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders' cause.

this well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the chagos islanders, who, it shows, between 1969 and 1971, were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the british and american governments. anglo-american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power. at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the western orbit, it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option. instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population. the film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection, and that from the dockside in mauritius where they were left, the displaced chagossian community fell into three decades of privation, and in these new circumstances, beset by homesickness, they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death.following the passage of more than three decades, however, in recent months (and years), following the release of many utterly damning papers from britain's public record office (one rather suspects that there was some mistake, and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public), resultant legal appeals by the chagossian community in exile have seen british courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the british state. as such, the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved. nevertheless, the governments of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants. this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see, but it is an important one for britons and americans to watch. to be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime.

this film is a great fun. i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends. i did last night and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world! i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as i did the first time. but they all thanked me and loved the movie. you know it is a great film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the movie! i once saw a con man almost up tonorma khouri's level, but no where near the same size ring. he fooledtons of very gullible and rich folks at my old berkeley ca a.a. group where everyone trusts everyone else. he would "sponsor" only people who seemed very well to do. who knew he would have stolen in excess of 100k(in 1987 when that was real money) after being in town for only 1 month. his victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober. he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face.the above crime is nothing compared to what norma khouri did to her old neighbor. but i don't want to give anything away.i just found this one night on a late night movie channel,"showtim" i think. this is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown. just drag your friends over to see this and don't tell them a thing. it is a very entertaining film, it moves quickly and never bores you.this should be a international classic for all time. i believe all great movies eventually rise to the top. time will be very good to this film. i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet,in some ways that makes the surprises even better.the director and editor were fantastic. they deserved winning the best documentary.just watch this film!

in the early to mid 1970's, clifford irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes,claiming to have spent months preparing for the book,engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire. when all of this turned out to be false,irving was accused of perjury & spent several years behind bars (although always admitting his findings were accurate). flash forward to 20001,several months prior to september 11th, a book,entitled 'forbidden love' (published in the u.s. as 'honor lost:love and death in modern day jordan') by a previously unknown author by the name of norma khouri,a woman from jordan,who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend dalia,due to the fact that dalia,being from a devout muslim background,was dating a christian man. it,like irving's biography on hughes was revealed as a potential hoax. australian film maker,anna broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was khouri's attempts to clear herself of the lie(s). over the time frame of 104 minutes,the film attempts to reveal is norma khouri telling the truth,or is she just a compulsive liar,with an agenda/vendetta of her own?. interview footage with those who know/knew her (including an ex husband,her publisher,and others) tell their side of the story. this is a toothsome,well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties. not rated,but contains pervasive bad language & a re-enactment of the grisly murder scene,played over a few times (but nothing nearly as graphic & disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic,such as saw:part 84). not a good choice for the little ones.

beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. forbidden lie$(2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of norma khouri's book forbidden love, and that was a best-seller. an onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman, lie$ is the very best in editorialised reality tv.cleverly edited and colourful, broinowski's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke. i disagree (with variety) that it's overlong; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others' just-recorded testimonials. on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired.....so i watched it twice.this oscar-worthy effort is at once genuinely funny, upsetting, and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another. the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouri's friends and fans(!). clearly these friends are now "turned", the funniest on-camera line belonging to khouri's qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat, no-nonsense colloquialisms: "i think it's a load of sh!t. personally".we need to learn from their experience, hence my belief in spoilers. any perennial lie-spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie. there's some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian, who instead presses her (con)"artist" repeatedly for corroboration.since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication, khouri has been on the run, but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name. she absconded supposedly because a) she's either terrified of her sly, more-italian-sounding-than-greek husband, or b) because she needed her passport/visas to clear her name. unlikely.a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas (one guess: no, not jordan). according to a closing card, khouri is "still under investigation by the fbi" in 2007.i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge. instead, the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen. once they caught on, there was plenty counter-derision and catcalls; earlier, stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn't know how to take khouri's evolving contradictions.the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end, not leaving anything out--not even her own self-sacrifice.anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself. the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first--key to how a lifelong liar operates: in half-truths. khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr-old with rather disarming charm, and surprisingly, worked-out biceps.gradually we're introduced to less-and-less-adulating aussie journos, publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri's honour-killing accusations hook, line and sinker. later we see their more rueful reactions, quite self-controlled and matter-of-fact, if some perhaps a little bitter.it was jordanian (anti-)honour-killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri's fallacies because its pot-stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change. honour-killings do happen in jordan; it's just their prevalence that's at odds with khouri's book--plus 72 other "facts". in 2003 these activists faxed (australian) random house with 73 painstakingly-checked objections.the publishing houses across 4 continents who'd jumped at the chance to publish first-time author khouri never tried to check any facts. leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract, they too were fair game. so a massive hot-topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes.later still we're shocked to discover that the "factual errors" extend to khouri's bio as well. for one thing, she's not only not a 35yr-old virgin (her defence is that she merely didn't disabuse people of their assumptions), but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers! sometimes she's just too fast-talking in her american accent. she also seems too-comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes. i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who don't need any western paternalism from me, but when even cultural cues don't jibe in addition to khouri's "facts", you've got to start questioning your source.at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion. she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account, in person, in jordan. the last third is consumed with a fact-finding trip back to amman, where one "fact" after another falls. eventually broinowski forces her (con)"artist" to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story, and it's after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera. secret, because in it khouri's "american security guard" jeremy is heard to have an australian accent: he's an actor! (we never find out how anna uncovered it.) so this becomes the filmmaker's triumph, as she never flags in her tone or commitment. her on-camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt, fbi documents--and khouri's most shocking initial crime.anna broinowski (watch-list her now) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device (key players cross-commenting on footage) to kill two birds--making her audiences want to drink from the same well again.in fact, despite her deceptively demure approach, she made me re-confirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their "norma khouri investigation".broinowski made me look.(10/10)

what a fascinating film. even if it wasn't based on real life, forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element. and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars.the author of forbidden love, norma, was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name.but the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing. what a patient woman! i loved this movie. i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon. the journey this film takes you on is clever, interesting and totally engrossing.

a best-selling book about honour killings in jordan is withdrawn by its publishers after allegations surface that the story has been fabricated; associated with other allegations of its author's past as a con-woman. a few years later, she resurfaces, conceding that she took a certain amount of dramatic licence but willing to cooperate with a film-maker to prove the substance of her allegations. what follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality, someone who's behaviour on one had makes no sense unless what she is saying is true, yet who is seemingly incapable of saying anything that is not astonishingly dramatic but unproven at best and most often, verifiably false. it's almost impossible to imagine what ms. khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film: vindication? celebrity? - all she does achieve is to project a certain image of herself as a deeply damaged individual, and even that cannot be taken at face value. director anna broinowski appears increasingly on camera as her film progresses, and increasingly exasperated to boot; but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable, although scary and disturbing, tale to tell - and one of those films that reminds us what a thoroughly weird world it is we live in.

you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story, believing it all, then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling... and then put back together again. brilliant.one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary. i don't know if - other than andrew jarecki's "capturing the friedmans" - there has ever been anything like anna broinowski's "forbidden lie$." it features, exposes, defends, reveals, and questions everything about norma khouri, author of "honor lost," the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in jordan.what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this "exposure" of khouri is made with khouri's full participation.for the initial portion of the film, khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman, the story of the book. she sounds completely believable, convincing.then her story is taken apart, exposed, by eminently believable and convincing people, such as women's rights activists in jordan, investigative reporters there and in australia, where khouri lived for a while.khouri comes back and denies the accusations, taking a successful lie-detector test in the process. there comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value... and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all, but the essential ones in the matter of the book).and the houdini act continues, with round after round in this heavy-weight, seesaw prize fight, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. brilliant.

i saw this film at the adelaide film festival '07 and was thoroughly intrigued for all 106 minutes. i like documentaries, but often find them dragging with about 25 minutes to go. forbidden lie$ powered on though, never losing my interest.the film's subject is norma khoury, a jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book forbidden love, a biographical story of sorts concerning a muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a christian man. a few years later though, a few journalists started poking holes in the story, leading the public to believe it was fraud. the film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in the company of norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction.director anna broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study, and she conducts endless interviews with khoury as she seeks the truth. as always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. norma fears for her life, worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of jordanian muslims. she refuses to return to jordan and show us the facts. broinowski is not deterred however, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us.the result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist. naturally, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately we don't know whether to believe norma or not. she's either a rather unfairly put-upon woman trying to survive, or a fantastic spinster. the web of lies, truths and half-truths she turns through the film is brilliant.the film uses much interview footage, as well as dramatisations to tell it's story, and broinowski uses these dramatisations to show us why people like norma are able to exist: we want to be conned. we go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what's happening on the screen is real. that might just be me reading into things a bit too much, it didn't come up in the q&a with brionowski after the film, but that's what i took away from it.this is a great australian film, and must receive an international release, and a swag of awards if you ask me. certainly the best film i saw at aff07.go see it, if you get the chance.

this documentary was interesting, but it was also long (so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes), like ben-hur long. but if your into that, this is for you. but only if you have a passion for movies, like i do. being that martin scorsese is my favorite director (live and maybe even ever), this is quite fascinating, especially if you know the style of scorsese's works. because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films. not the best documentary film ever made, but it is a leap for scorsese, which is always good to watch. a

i would never have thought i would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound. thanks to martin scorsese i did (the movie was from f. borzage). you will start to understand (if it's not already the case), what makes a good movie.

an enthralling, wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent martin scorsese. many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works, particularly the earlier ones, the silent era. very enjoyable despite being a bit long, i found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet. required viewing if you admire martin scorsese and his work.

thre isn't a single scorsese movie i'd place on a list of my favorite movies. but this is the best thing i've run through my dvd player in about five years. scorsese's patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. it's 3 dvd-sides worth of material. it would have to be a british production, since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet, methodical, no frills, put-the-focus-on-the-content approach that is taken here. and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites. i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies. you should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. not just more "me-too" votes for the godfather, etc.. people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. if they did, movies would be more interesting than they are. scorsese does know what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling, involved speaker on the topic. i really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the last decade.on a negative note, scorsese is best when he's excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when he's didactically teaching you something well-established about film history. and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. it's very distracting.

prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese examines a selection of his favorite american films grouped according to three different types of directors: the director as an illusionist: d.w. griffith or f. w. murnau, who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward; the director as a smuggler: filmmakers such as douglas sirk, samuel fuller, and mostly vincente minnelli, directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films; and the director as iconoclast: those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang-ups like orson welles, erich von stroheim, charles chaplin, nicholas ray, stanley kubrick, and arthur penn.he shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was, though oppressive, the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations. during his clips from the movies he shows us, we not only discover films we've never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees. he evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves.the idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish, hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make "lists." however, canon merely denotes "the best" and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the "best" films, a lot like a greatest hits tape, if just as a beginning direction for film students. all in all, one's experience has shown that all writing about film, including reviews, function to construct a film canon. some film canons can definitely be elitist, but others can be "populist." as an example, the internet movie database's top 250 movies list includes many films included on several "elitist" film canons but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film "elitists" scoff, like the dark knight, which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films, schindler's list and one flew over the cuckoo's nest, and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as iron man, sin city, die hard, the terminator and kill bill: vol. 2. writer scorsese's taxi driver paul schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as "elitist" and contends that this is positive.scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies, but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both ideological realms, we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism. elitism concentrates all attention, recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding. that discrimination could easily lead to self-indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of jean-luc godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael haneke. yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people's will. as has been previously asserted about the all-encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema, populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema. one can only continue seeing films, because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice. and that's what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us, something which can't be told without being seen first-hand.

when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series, he grabbed the opportunity with both hands. a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating, wide-ranging and, as the title says, a highly personal look at hollywood cinema.scorcese's story is primarily about hollywood's directors  actors, producers, screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention. he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the director's vision and the distributor's profit motive, between art and commercial viability. he even opens with a clip from vincente minnelli's the bad and the beautiful, one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction. this dictates the structure for the documentary. scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichés have become challenged, how mavericks have challenged the production code, and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different. however, scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses (he lavishes praise on cecil b. de mille), or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonetheless.scorcese doesn't necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either (orson welles and alfred hitchcock, two of scorcese's biggest influences, are only mentioned in passing). instead, he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story. for example, he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved. he looks at the work of vincente minnelli (probably the most often referenced director of the documentary) to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents. i can imagine that, had this assignment not been limited to america, scorcese would have also loved to talk about, for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell. as it is, he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau, billy wilder and douglas sirk, as well as the work of us-born filmmakers that was produced elsewhere  such as that of stanley kubrick.rather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically, scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects. in his section on the language and tools of cinema, he begins with dw griffith, looks at the coming of sound, colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which, although scorcese is not keen on them, he is even-handed enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them. however, he doesn't simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it. instead, he then rewinds back to the 1940s, to show how a low-budget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elements.a personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made. there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without, and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope. scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures. i was pleased to see that, when he talks about kubrick in his "iconoclasts" chapter, he looks at lolita and barry lindon, for me his two most underrated films. scorcese's respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully, rather than just giving us tiny bits, and he interrupts them with talking heads (a combination of archive and new interviews) only when necessary. there is a bit of bias towards the 40s and 50s, but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema. and after all, i don't think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journey.one word of warning though, in its in depth look at certain pictures, this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers.

as a "rebuttle" of sorts to the afi's top 100 films, the british film institute worked out a documentary with martin scorsese.now. i am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many, many films. but, i am nowheres in comparrison with my idol. in this fantastic (though long) documentary, scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the american history on film. this is divided in to several sections including the western, the gangster film and the noir. full of bouncy enthusiasm, martin scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor.

huge, exhaustive and passionate summary of american cinema as seen through the eyes of martin scorcese. needless to say, there is never a dull moment in all of its 4 hour running time. many genres, periods and directors are all examined, discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director. for anyone even remotely interested in american films, or cinema in general. a masterpiece, and the best of the bfi's century of cinema series.

thank the lord for martin scorsese, and his love of the movies.this is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented american artist working in cinema today, and i couldn't recommend it more. i was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too. just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world, you'll love it.

earth (2009) ***1/2 big screen adaptation of the bbc/discovery channel series "planet earth" offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moments of "how the hell did they get this footage?!" while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel (witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal!) and adorable (the various babies and their 'rents). the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its 'god's eye views' and profundity. culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and could've even gone longer! oh, well, there's always the next time (since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come). dirs: alastair fothergill & mark linfield.

greetings again from the darkness. stunning photography highlights this disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the harshness of animals that live in the wilderness. for anyone over 40, disney and mutual of omaha's wild kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals since our childhood ... back when there was no channel dedicated to national geographic or nature or animal planet.what always fascinates is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. watching the elephants trudge for days, nearly delirious from lack of water, is oh so painful. but their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling.some of the underwater shots are breathless. the mama and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is every bit as chilling as "jaws". the most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the himalayas. i had never seen such detail of the vastness of the range.don't think most young kids today will be too excited by this one, but it surely is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries i have ever seen.

why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary "earth"? how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you? ok, i will not elongate my review exploration on "earth" to infinity, but i must stand my ground on why this is a "must see". the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path, a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey, and an elephant mama with her small (maybe not so small, they are elephants) offspring migrating in africa. directors alastair forthegill & mark linfield did an "out of this earth" job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists. the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton, mike holding, adam ravetch, and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors; not to mention, the slo-mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e. "earth" is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals; the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence. so fellow earthlings, it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit "earth" today! **** good

in 2006, the ampas awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on earth, that film was march of the penguins narrated by academy award winning actor morgan freeman.walt disney studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now. they've taken their stabs at live action film making and it's been hit and miss all across the board. disney then created a sub-division called disneynature and release its first feature film titled earth. this is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries i've seen in quite sometime. narrated by the great james earl jones, earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the discovery channel in the past five years or follows the global warming crisis very closely. earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter.it enables an emotional connection to nature that i haven't experienced before. it also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet, but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails. it's one thing to watch "mufasa" fall from a cliff in to a stampede or bambi's mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods. it's all good because at the end of the film we know it is, just that, a film. this shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all types of families, from all walks of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. these real things make a real movie experience.though a bit heavy-weight on the graphic nature of the film (which many people will disagree), earth is a touching experience. there is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by george fenton. in comparison to march of the penguins or grizzly man, it doesn't really hold any measure but it stands great on its own. at the end of the day, you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we'll witness in the film. we live here yet it's like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another. earth is beautiful.***/****

first of all, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film. it should be more properly referred to as: "earth, 2009". secondly, allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the "planet earth" tv series of 2006. i have not seen this tv series, but learned here, that this film is the full length version of this 2006 tv series. i judge any film, on it's own merits, not by it's source. i judge the results, on their own, and the results of "earth, 2009" are indeed excellent. i dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers: that it's simply an expanded version of the 2006 tv series "planet earth". so what? it doesn't really matter.as a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime, i was astonished and highly impressed by "earth, 2009". this is the debut film from the new "disneynature" division of disney and follows in the footsteps of walt disney's pioneering and academy award winning nature documentary films of the 1950's and 1960's.cinematography, film editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. there have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories. what really sets "earth, 2009" apart is its' scope. it literally covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents.after my first viewing, it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create. three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film."earth, 2009" convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december, from the north pole to the south pole.two special new high-tech cameras were used for this film: one camera has a 360 degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camera set to an amazing 1,000 frames per second. this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of "earth, 2009" especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the world's highest waterfall. there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary.via cinematography, music score and narration, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker, excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration, i consider "earth, 2009" as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made.five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication really paid off very well here. this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world. i predict an academy award for best documentary feature, among other awards. truly, an amazing, astonishing, exhilarating and magnificent documentary film.very highly recommended

i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed. i generally like to see documentaries, but i can't remember to have seen one that is better than 'earth'. i knew some of the scenes from youtube videos that i found by random browsing. i also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores, running on the displayed high definition tvs. after seeing the movie it's obvious to me why the footage is so popular among youtube users and multimedia retail managers: it's just so awesome and spectacular that you can't help but stare on the screen, no matter if you're generally interested in nature documentaries or not.without hesitating a 10 out of 10. for sure, there are more thrilling movies, but in regard of documentaries, 'earth' is definitely one of the best of it's genre.

earth is a must see for children and adults. my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears. we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth. there are some animals in danger to disappear. exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. this documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before. then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. the director did a great job here that gets high respect. nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate. i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel.

i saw this movie with my family and it was great! this film is more than just a documentary (that offers not more than cold facts) with long mono/-duologue's and lots of charts...the complete "power" of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water, in the air or the arctic.with watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book, it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life. this movie is not only for "environmental fanatics" although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it. this movie taught me that we are not only living on the earth...we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.

i almost did not go see this movie because i remember march of the penguin was not that much exciting. i went mainly because disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend, but after i did go see it, it was simply amazing; the fact that the photographers can capture impossible images are simply worth your money. you also get to see different habitats, different vegetation, animals, and natural phenomenons that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world, of how our lives have deviated from nature to such a degree that we take for granted of the natural beauty and miracles that are quintessential to our biosphere. you don't have to be an earth lover or a tree-hugging environmentalist to appreciate the mere awesomeness of this documentary. you simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of living. enjoy!

this is a run-of-the-mill nature porn movie. by porn, i don't mean sex. i mean gratuitous images of (for example) thousands of birds together, or hundreds of walruses, or a giant waterfall or iceberg. several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer, to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film.there is almost no plot in this film. told to expect a story of three animal families, "better than march of the penguins", the movie simply doesn't deliver. the blame rests in three key areas: (1) the writers who gave james earl jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history, (2) the music team who over-dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling, even when the film fails to motivate, and lastly but most importantly (3) the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason, no continuity, no flow, sucking the life out of the entire film -- a film about life. when we got to the whales halfway through the film, i sunk back in my seat with dread, hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through, and that i'd be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen.there was also almost no science in the film at all. they attributed hot and cold (all of it, not just the seasons) solely to the earth's tilt, ignoring the fact that we'd have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm. and it would be worst if we had no rotation (relative to revolution) like mercury, because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze. then near the end they used the phrase "humans and animals", as if humans are not animals, somehow exempt from the laws of nature. so much for science.i must credit the camera work, however, and again that is why i call this nature porn. everything from super-slow-motion to what appears to be a finely-tuned mechanically-controlled time-lapse photography, was put to use to provide some (and i caution, only "some") stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films. that said, i am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen. some of the shots showing the great watering hole in africa, as it changed from season to season seemed like cgi to me. a director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it's all natural, but they didn't do that.for a film about earth, i had expected a lot more of earth to be shown. what we saw was pristine. we had to take the narrator's word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes. they didn't show us evidence of it. they didn't show us alberta's poisonous tailing ponds visible from space. they didn't show us the great pacific trash whorl. they didn't show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet. these are as much earth as anything else. why cover it up for a feel-good whitewash? my last criticism of the content is of predation. any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey, the music turned almost into that mt doom scene from lord of the rings, with the predator portrayed as some kind of sauron ultimate-evil character. but predators aren't evil. they perform a necessary service, ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive. we are predators ourselves. any time the predator caught the prey, we immediately cut away to something else, to sort of pretend that death and eating don't really happen. the final insult was the "dad" polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat. "bad bear! bad!", you can almost hear them say.on to the presentation itself. my theatre may be in part to blame for this, but maybe not. i had expected to see something with greater clarity than i could see on my own hdtv lcd at home. but the picture was blurry, and was presented in the same 16:9 ratio i could get at home, instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days. and during one action-packed scene near the end, the film (i can't imagine this happening digitally, from how it looked) was damaged, and we lost several of the colors, eventually blacking out completely. that repeated about three times.if they actually do plant a tree on my behalf, it will have been worth it. but how will i know?

in celebration of earth day disney has released the film "earth". stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom, we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves.the stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf. the narrative begins at the north pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics, all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed.global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear; note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years. we never see the bears catch any seals, but the father's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution.the aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots i ever saw; it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen.one of the disappointments i felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion. never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed. the idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness i think began with (or at least it's the first i recall seeing) the television show "kung fu" during the early seventies.an interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed. there are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs. perhaps because of some selective editing (sparing us, as it were, from the grisly end of a prey-predator moment) and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on dvd it is a solid film in its own right. and you can take your kids!three stars.

this documentary makes you travel all around the globe. it contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness. it shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be. the polar bear's future is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it. after all, its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming. this documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue. it can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive. scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of al gore's documentary "an inconvenient truth" but frankly...what a description!!! a question may then arise: isn't it worth preserving our world's beauty? because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different pollutions. by living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature. all things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called "earth".

the spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes, although i don't mention it in great detail."earth" is an approx. 90 minute cinema version based on "planet earth" which i watched all on bbc tv.the tv version was narrated by david attenborough, a captivating commentator, who i had wished had also done it for "earth" but it is patrick stewart, star trek's captain picard. there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that's may be appropriate. in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it. there are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to antarctica. 3 animal families, polar bear, elephant and whale, appear in more than one of these parts. each "chapter" starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is. we see something of each kind of animal, but only mammals and birds, and some fish, and some beautiful shots of vegetation, mountains, waterfalls, deserts and jungle, a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth. you get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals: people or villages or cities aren't in the film, so it's a typical nature documentary, but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music. when the film opened i already knew it would end far too soon for me. it is a family film, so no brutal killings of any animals. when one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it's shot in slow-motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children (age limit 6 in the netherlands). no blood is shed. some scenes (newly born animals) are really cute and will be adored by kids. it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took (4000) and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty. it had it's dutch premiere yesterday, a month before the actual release, in a cinema of 500 seats, of which 15 were taken. true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers, it seems. as i knew the tv-series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie. some didn't, but the most impressive shots (big waterfalls) did, luckily. it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film.

you have to see it to believe it! directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield have done a thing really great, it is a 10 out of 10 so i can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. i am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet. finally, it has nothing to do with al gore's documentary-movie "an inconvenient truth" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with "truths" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. the best thing you can do on earth is not miss earth.

rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to planet earth... of *course* planet earth is better - it has much much more of the same. earth is like an extended trailer for the planet earth series, and as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. but that is not comparing like with like.as a feature-length documentary (or actually as a feature-length anything), it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life (unless you choose to traverse the earth in helicopters with long-range cameras for years on end, and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth, which - lets face it - is unlikely).on the narration: yes everyone in the uk - very much including me - adores david attenborough, and there's little excuse for him not to be narrating here, but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three. he wasn't a presenter on planet earth, just a narrator, and i'm sure he's modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a good thing.anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe, majesty and glory. all reviewers agree on that. those who love it (ie. everyone) will/should go on to see an buy planet earth. so three cheers for its cinematic release, and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on dvd rather than the planet earth box-set. but as works of art they're not in competition here people.the earth is big enough for both.

just like al gore shook us up with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary-movie "an inconvenient truth", directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield also remind us that it's about time to improve our way of life in order to save our beautiful planet. "planet earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. al gore showed us the bleak future of planet earth by presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples through long yet always interesting monologues. the creators of this documentary choose a different yet equally powerful way to accomplish this. they do not present us with a future representation of what might occur to our planet if we don't radically change things around, but they rather show us the genuine beauty of planet earth in all of its amazing glory. we see places that we knew that existed but never thought they could be so beautiful. in this movie, we see a wide array of the most extraordinary places such as forsaken deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora and icy-landscapes as far as the eye could see. and in all of those immensely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive.this is exactly the kind of movie that had to be made, in combination with the one from al gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to meddle with. the voice-over by patrick stewart is always relaxing and thus very well done although at first it sounded as though i was watching an x-men movie instead! the cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing of this documentary. at times: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all of that delightful footage.in short: this is definitely a must-see for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet earth! the truth is: i never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful!

i have to say that sometimes "looks" are all that matters, just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out (not about our earth though, but he is right anyway).and when it comes to looks, this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see.and then there's the personality of the movie as well, interesting, with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images.the movie probably won't affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is.this movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed.

i've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series, "planet earth," narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough. nevertheless, whether it was screened down here in australia or not, i never caught up with it, and when i happened upon the opportunity to see 'earth (2007)'  a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen, i jumped at the chance. the theatre was basically empty; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me, and it was as though i had, not only the big screen to myself, but, indeed, the entire planet earth. for 90 minutes, i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness, amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film. awesome in its scope, and yet painfully intimate at times, 'earth' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet, and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction.though the film, directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield, obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness, it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda, and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether; indeed, there is not a human in sight. instead, we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world, to experience the resilience, and also the fragility, of life on earth. i hear that the original mini-series, which ran for eleven episodes, delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems, but i think that, here, the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact: i can't remember the last time that i felt so inspired, and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time. by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals, anthropomorphising them to an extent, we are suddenly able to appreciate the "human side" of each species, and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy.'earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice, or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta. the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death, most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator-prey interactions. though occasionally, perhaps to cater towards a younger audience, the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment, i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature, and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final, hopeless efforts at survival. there's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt, both in the slow-motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey {the result of a single fateful misstep}, or the majestic mid-air leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion. it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species.aside from these main stories, we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world, including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea, and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes. of course, entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone, and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly. by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear, elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles, via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography, throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show, and only 90 minutes to show it. consequently, 'earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, i now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd box-set for "planet earth." uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.

there is some spectacular, heart stoppingly beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything in between. the camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work. editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too, with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world. where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories and hunter/ hunted interactions across multiple environments. eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed. overall, well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don't expect oscar material.

i loved the way earth is made. its photography is unbelievable, editing it must have been an interesting challenge and patrick stewart's voice over is perfect. in addition its music and sound editing make watching earth a profound experience you don't want to miss. you really are on a journey to where you would probably never-ever end up by yourself. and although, at first, i was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival, i could not help laughing myself sometimes. nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend.but, rather than the need to laugh, i left the cinema with a profound question:"howcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?"with this question in mind, you'll understand how i felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing earth. i felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once (all that not being a ngo activist at all!)...so i immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what i could do to save our -still- fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate... (www.loveearth.com)i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there. yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through.i hope that cutting on my energy-use will do. i don't know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state...an inspiring film it is, but i didn't leave the cinema feeling very happy.

this was playing at our theater in amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was sold-out so we went to this, not knowing anything about it other than it was a documentary about the planet. we were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of earth. this film has some of the most breathtaking photography i have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things i have never seen in a film, tv or book! "earth" is a film that every student should see before they become jaded. i will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be inheriting the planet we leave her. this is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic.

this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see. i thought it was just another documentary, but it really is something else. it doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature.i won't talk about the quality of the pictures, because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched.earth is funny, tense and sad. it can make you laugh, it can make you cry. sometimes both at the same time. this is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with, yet we don't appreciate it one bit.this movie should be shown obligatory in schools. it is the most wonderful film you will ever see, so go and see it. who knows, maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this...10/10, but i would easily rate it more if it were possible.

i was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must-see movie for people that love movies about nature. the movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the north pole and going down south as the movie progresses. the footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and i many times wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky. however beautiful, a large part of the footage i had already seen in the tv series 'planet earth', narrated by david attenborough. i found attenborough's narration of planet earth to be much better than the narration of earth. 'earth' is an easier movie. it skips much of the scientific detail that attenborough covers in his 'planet earth' series. for instance, earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale, because there are few predators. planet earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because the water is low in oxygen and doesn't contain enough nutrients to support very large animals, like large sharks, etc. to me, that's an important difference. that, together with attanborough's far superior voice make planet earth a far better documentary than earth. still, however, i think earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too.

mardi gras: made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but, are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another. david redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to 20 dollars. when redmon questions americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded. when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little remorseful but didn't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth. when redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads. the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it. this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own.m. pitts

documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated. this film seems to take all opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. it is sad the conditions these poor people have to work in, this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops. the film mardi gras: made in china was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another country.i had to watch this film for an english class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped get the topic rolling. it was a great, very informative movie and i'd recommend anyone see it, it kinda opens your eyes.

i've watched this documentary twice - and although i'm an major movie buff, most documentaries don't hold my attention. this film however was mesmerizing. almost every shot is perfect - saying so much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have).the concept of this film is amazing, i can't praise it enough. mardi gras beads - who would have thought?? amazing and excellent choices of interviews - film footage of a factory in china - the film makes you feel like you are actually there.i'm political aware - and i've read several books on globalization so there wasn't anything in this film that was a surprise to me. however, it's made me think so much. i wish so much too, that this world was a better place.a million kudos to the filmmaker - and thanks for making this film too.i wish everyone could see it.

sharp, well-made documentary focusing on mardi gras beads. i have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex, and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home.i am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and globalism's effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it). rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox (not that there's anything wrong with that, other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted), this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads, how they are manufactured, by what people, and under what conditions, and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process. it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, american importers, and finally, the consumer at the end of the chain.i felt a little sickened by this; equally by the mardi gras revelers, but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end, made a particular impression. but that was just my reaction; i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently.unlike other documentaries on this subject, i don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this. this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume. if you have ever bought a product made in the far east, this should give you something to think about.outstanding and highly recommended. need to see more documentaries like this. kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film.

wow! wow! wow! i have never seen a non-preachy documentary on globalization until i saw mardi gras: made in china. this film has zero narration and combines verite footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in china who live inside a factory compound. they play with toys, jump rope, and dance. yet, the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work, and work -- but the footage of their work is illuminating and mesmerizing to watch. the owner of the factory in china is amazingly open, so much so that he hits home the effects of globalization while he "punishes" the workers. astutely following mardi gras beads from china to the carnival, the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting, compelling footage from both cultures. one of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and mardi gras revelers to each other through pictures. here, the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. the film is never preachy, is not guilt driven, and allows everyone's point of view to be present. at the end, we -- the viewers -- make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film, and globalization.

excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted, ordinary beads exchanged during mardi gras. the film is much more than a commentary on globalization. in fact, it humanizes the workers in china, the owner of the factory, the bead distributor in new orleans, and even the revelers in new orleans. what stands out the most is the director's ability to tell a tricky story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. his amazing access to the factory is another aspect that's intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside. it's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling alienated.

the film exposes the blatant exploitation of the chinese worker - generally female - garnering footage from the chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint, his american counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, the drunken americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in new orleans. the glimmer of hope comes when some americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like $0.10 per hour to do so. you also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor.i have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them. i just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact american indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world. honorable mention goes to wal-mart. it is simply amazing. and clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!

in this documentary we meet roger, the rich manager of a factory in china that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at mardi gras in new orleans. roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides, but interviews with four of them tell quite another story. the girls' bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of mardi gras itself. filmmaker david redmon should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound, and for landing a revealing on-camera interview with the head of the u.s. company that imports and sells the beads. the movie is compellingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous "made in china" labels.

mardi gras: made in china provides a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity, and globalization through the making and tossing of beads. i saw this film at the international film festival of boston, and was expecting a dry introduction to globalization, but what i got was a riveting visual display of shocking footage from both china and the united states. the eye-opening film is humorous, in-depth, serious, non-patronizing, and it leaves you wanting more as the credits role. it is worth comparing to murderball -- it's simply that well done. the young women workers in china have various points of view, and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline. the revelers during carnival are the highlight, but only because this excellent film provides in-depth context inside the factory in china without narration. bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film! i would have never thought about the connection between beads, china, and new orleans; now i think about the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality, and fun. more importantly, i can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this film, unlike other films on globalization that i've seen.

more like psychological analysis of movies, but psycho does sound better as a header. the man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you will) does depict movies here in his own way. most of them are classics, but all of them are listed here at imdb and i'd strongly advise you to see them (especially the hitchcock movies, solyaris, conversation & and the lynch movies), because slavoj zizek will reference them! or in other words, he might spoil them for you. i don't remember if he spoiled more than those i've listed (i think the chaplin movies too), but as i wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand! in the imdb listing there is a movie missing, that i did report to them, so it might get up there pretty soon. it's a meg ryan movie, but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways.zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you're open minded to see things through another perspective (even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ... it doesn't mean it will do that, but it could)!

his choice of films, the basic 'conceit' of the production (which places him in the sets or simulacra of the films he is commenting on ) and his delivery are brilliant! but if you want freud, be aware that you're getting zizek's version of lacan, which should not be confused with lacan himself. as usual, zizek delivers complex ideas with gusto and in a convincing manner. the rub is he is also quite mercurial and so there may be more in his gusto than in actual content. cinematically, it is a gem. psychologically, this will have people of all persuasions (freudians, lacanians and jungians) scratching their heads but reaching for the popcorn all the same. zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon unto himself.

the pervert's guide to cinema (2007) **** if loving cinema makes me a pervert, so be it!if you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then i'm sure you can't get enough of films about film-making and i don't mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then. i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience. well if that's the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you.in sophie fiennes (sister of ralph & joseph if you were wondering) has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive (and often outrageous) takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing, probing, and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings, socioeconomic, political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging, determined and near-frenetic dissertations. to go from explaining how the bates' house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego, superego & id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman.although i had no idea who zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma, european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese  with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host comes across as a mad prophet. fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick, lynch, hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz, the red shoes, and fight club. there's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes  even if they are freudian/jungian to a fault  then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch. seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video; it's the only way to appreciate it.

famous movies are subject to freudian analysis: possessed, the matrix, the birds, psycho, vertigo, duck soup, monkey business, the exorcist, the testament of dr mabuse, alien, alien resurrection, the great dictator, city lights, the tramp, alice in wonderland, the wizard of oz, dr strangelove, the red shoes, fight club, dead of night, the conversation, blue velvet, solaris, stalker, mulholland drive, lost highway, persona, in the cut, eyes wide shut, the piano teacher, three colours: blue, dogville, frankenstein, the ten commandments, saboteur, rear window, to catch a thief, north by northwest, star wars, dune, kubanskie kazaki, ivan the terrible, pluto's judgment day (walt disney), wild at heart.you may wonder how the marx brothers come into play. according to slavoj zizek, the host and analyst of this intellectually tickling tour de force, groucho is the superego, chico the ego, and harpo the id.scenes from the above listed films are used to illustrate concepts: the role of fantasy in shaping reality and vice-versa, the father figure, male and female libido, death drive, etc. here are some of slavoj utterances (most as paraphrases): "desire is a wound on reality", "fantasy realized is a nightmare", "music is the opium of the people" (borrowing from k. marx), "of all human emotions, anxiety is the only one that is not deceiving". the whole is bracketed by an intro that declares "you don't look for your desires in movies, instead cinema tells you what you should desire" and concludes with the cineaste view that "cinema is needed today so that we can understand our current reality" -- i say, as long as censorship doesn't derail it.the three part subdivision is merely mechanical, possibly with tv screening in mind. for the theater goer it is irrelevant.

the person who wrote the review "enough with the sweating and spitting already" has no grasp of what cultural, literary, or psycho- critique is. he dismisses zizek's interpretations because they don't seem "in line" with what the director originally intended. so what? the importance of a director's (or author's) intention is not important in critical theory. this is known as the author's "intentional fallacy" and should be avoided.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intentional_fallacy a text or movie can be analyzed through a number of theories, many of which disagree with one another, as well as completely ignore the author's intention. this is the most fundamental idea of critical theory.because of this, whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting zizek. in reality, anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit this guys opinion (i suggest you should too) as it is completely off point.that being said... if you are at all interested in freudian, laconian, or kristevian discourse, this movie is a must. it connects these theories with popular film, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them.

i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it (and they are not pervs!) as a must see. and it is a must see! just don't expect to see something outbreaking.the freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film, but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end.some of the good things are the analyzes of kieslowski's blue, most of david lynch's, some of hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more i missed (i just remembered...dogville), and i usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air.other than being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory.i really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr. zizek to revive freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, specially in north america. again, it's way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood.

there's the danger with the critic/philosopher slavoj zizek with his film, directed by sophie fiennes, which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent, horror, sci-fi, surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr freudian comparisons to overload. but in the pervert's guide to cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis i've seen on a collective section of films. while it doesn't cover the expansive territory scorsese's movie documentaries cover, the same attachments are there, and zizek has a definite love for all of these "perverse" examples and films, primarily the work of hitchcock, lynch, chaplin and tarkovsky. yet one shouldn't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is, i got to see it almost by luck- thinking zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse, deranged manner. if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the marx brothers as representations of the id, super-ego and ego (harpo's example is most dead-on for me).he's not just one to take on the classics though, he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former, and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one's own self as well as ones double in the latter. he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the sith when anakin becomes darth vader, and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children's births happens elsewhere. the ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality (at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare's creation), and female subjectivity, are explored perhaps most dead-on with vertigo. this too goes for a scene that zizek deconstructs as if it's the zapruder film, where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the 'don't you look at me' scene in blue velvet.now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as scorsese does. but he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality, and how they overlap, intersect, become one and the same, or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters (i.e. lost highway) by putting himself in the locations the films take place in. funniest is first seeing him in the boat "heading" towards the same dock tippi hedren's boat heads to at the beginning of the birds; equally funny is as he waters the blue velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of frank booth; only one, when he's in solaris-like territory, does it seem a little cheesy. but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up, and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and zizek's words come through.there were some films i of course would've expected, chiefly from hitchcock and lynch, but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the pervert's guide of cinema (top two for me would be the disney pluto cartoon and the exposition on chaplin's films, albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice'), and the ones that one hasn't seen yet (i.e. the ventriloquist horror film, dr. mabuse, stalker, among a few others) that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow, i have to see that immediately, no questions asked.' zizek is a powerful writer with his work, and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place, to be entertained, sure, but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet. it's probably one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how freud works its way into films regarding desire, the id/super-ego/ego, and of the supernatural in fantasy, that you may never see...unless distribution finally kicks in, if only on the smallest levels.

"cinema is the ultimate pervert art. it doesn't give you what you desire; it tells you how to desire."so begins "the pervert's guide to cinema," in which slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst slavoj zizek applies his freudian/lacanian brain-scalpel to world cinema. this film in three parts is the second feature documentary directed by sophie fiennes (yes, sister of ralph and joseph), and it is a notable accomplishment, clocking in at 2 1/2 hours of talk from one man and yet remaining humorous and engaging throughout. in essence, it is an extended film lecture, and one of the best you may ever get. over the course of the film, zizek guides us through a catalog of obsession and desire in film history. he touches on more than 40 films and, in particular, spends a great deal of time with hitchcock, lynch, chaplin, tarkovsky, the marx brothers, and eisenstein. but he also takes a close look at "persona," "the conversation," "three colors: blue," "dogville," "fight club," and "the exorcist." thematically, zizek's inquiry into cinema ranges from thoughts on the death drive to the "coordinates of desire," and from gnosticism to "partial objects.""the pervert's guide" will be a slightly better experience if you've taken a few minutes to bone up on your basic freudian terminology. however, even if you're not steeped in psychoanalytic theory, zizek's dynamic and hilarious personality carries the film forward with such gusto that you aren't likely to balk at the specialized lingo. the film frequently cuts from movie clips to images of zizek *inside* the movie he is talking about--that is, in the original locations and sets. the transitions in these sequences sustain such tension and humor that the trick never gets old. and zizek himself is constantly making us laugh, either from bizarre little jokes or from his enthusiastic insistence on, for example, a bold oedipal interpretation of "the birds." and this go-ahead-and-laugh attitude, on the parts of both fiennes and zizek, is essential to the gonzo character of the film. it is the spoonful of sugar that helps us digest zizek's weird medicine. after all, don't we all have a sense that, past a certain point, psychology theorists are just pulling our legs?

lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen zizek, you know his pace.also if you haven't seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc, you will be somewhat lost. and the film list is long. director includes hitchcock (psycho, vertigo, birds), lynch (lost highway,mullholland falls, wild at heart, blue velvet ), tarkovsky (stalker, solaris) and the conversation(coppola) there are some segway films like, star wars: espisode iii, matrix ... but these i suspect are baits. to be sure, zizek is never boring, but if you don't buy (or if you mind) the psycho analytics, then you'll be annoyed to no end. but you should not be, as the setting, clips, the way the film interleave with these clips, zizek's points are never boring.

bear in mind, any film (let alone documentary) which asserts any kind of truth, will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism, from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless, those of you who are already masters of psychology, film, and captains of the soul, will no doubt find this movie redundant, after all, you already know everything there is to know. congrats.for those of us in the minority like myself, i found "the perverts guide to cinmea"....mostly brilliant, and worth watching for those interested in movies, psychology, and modern philosophy.a little like scott mclouds' "understanding comics", director sophie fiennes, inter-grates slovene philosopher, psychologist, and social critic slavoj zizek right into many of the films and specif scenes he discusses. the cover is an image from "the birds"(zizek takes a boat out to re-create the shot).lacanian psycho-analysis, does not necessarily scream, an evening of great fun...but it is! if you like movies that is.... having some knowledge of lacanian psycho-analysis helps (symbolic, real, and imaginary) are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first, but the scenes which zizek selects and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me, a very abstract subject. in fact, it's probably better to have a familiarity with the films he's discussing than with the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer as the film goes on.why i love, this film isn't because it picks great films to analyze or reveals great truths about lacan, but shows in a very practical and clever manner, where film and psychology (and by default philosophy) meet.why is "the sound of music" kinda fascistic, why is "short cuts" about more than just class and alienation, why do the birds attack in "the birds", what is there to learn about the mind from "alien resurrection", what does the planet of "solaris" want, what does "psycho" and "the marx brothers" have to do with each other, and what the hell is david lynch getting across in movie after movie...well zizek has some ideas.the role of the voice in both "the excorcist" and "star wars: revenge of the sith", is maybe the movies strongest and most lucid moment, when he gets into feminine sexual subjectivity i begin to wonder...at one point zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta, that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children (jokingly, it seems but...).anyway, it's a fascinating documentary, which anyone who has ever seen a movie, and thought it meant something more than was literally stated, should make an attempt to see.and anyone interested in slavoj zizek, this is a must as well, much less dry than "reality of the virtual", and more direct than "zizek!", two other pseudo-docs, about "the elvis of contemporary cultural criticism", as he is being dubbed, in the english speaking world."the perverts guide to cinema" is not about the role of sex in cinema. zizek claims cinema is the ultimate pervert art, because it teaches "how to desire, and not what to desire", and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be articulated. this is not a film about finding the reality in cinema, it's about finding the cinema in reality, and how important and exciting that can be. hard to find, and a bit long, but well worth the trouble, one of the most "stimulating" movie watching experiences i've ever had.

i saw this film at the toronto international film festival. not as salacious as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring slovenian superstar philosopher/psychoanalyst slavoj zizek. zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. it was directed by sophie fiennes, of the multi-talented fiennes clan (she's sister to actors ralph and joseph).i enjoyed this quite a bit, although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd, since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested. freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours. it didn't help that an ill-advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so.my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes. he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch, not exactly masters of subtlety. i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films, although that's really just me saying i'd like to see part four and five and six.zizek is very funny, and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing. so, for instance, we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay (from hitchcock's the birds) or sitting in the basement of the bates motel (from psycho). which is not to say that his theories are not provocative. even when i found myself disagreeing with him, it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films. which is exactly what he's trying to accomplish.

he's stocky, sweaty, slightly cross-eyed and restless. he stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert. he claims that we  the film viewers  perceive the screen as a toilet bowl, and are all secretly wishing for all the s**t to explode from the inside. he's unpredictable and scary. well? come on, you could have guessed by now: he's one of the leading philosophers of our age.slavoj iek is both a narrator and a subject of sophie fiennes' extraordinary new film, a pervert's guide to the cinema. fiennes illustrates a feature-long lecture by iek, and does so in two ways: by providing exemplary film clips and putting iek on real (or reconstructed) locations from the movies he speaks about. it's always nice to watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies (although revenge of the sith got here as well), but the main attraction of a pervert's guide is iek himself. what makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question one cannot help but ask over and over again: what is more outrageous, iek's views or iek's screen presence? in a documentary by astra taylor (iek!, 05), slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent. because, he claimed, he feels like he doesn't exist in the first place, the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and feverishly. and talk he did, and how. also a pervert's guide is dominated by his voice  delivering perfect english in most crazy way, and making some astonishing points about the cinema.what are those? well, for example he sees chaplin's reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself (kind of alien force taking over the human being  think the ventriloquist segment of dead of night [45]). he says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects, not to provide us with them. he identifies groucho marx as super ego, chico as ego and harpo as id. he says a million other interesting things, and all the time we cannot take our eyes off him, so persuasive (and captivating) are his looks. at some point i couldn't help but stare at his thick, scruffy hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays stored underneath. craving, of course, for more insights.most notable are iek's readings of lynch and hitchcock (which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them). the cumulative effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of iek's lecture memorable and  unlike others  difficult to argue with, since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors. this doesn't go for his reading of tarkovsky for example, upon whom he relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view of reality, dismissing precisely what's so remarkable in all tarkovsky (namely strong religious intuitions and images).the question isn't whether iek is inspiring and brilliant, because he is; or whether fiennes film is worth watching, because it is likewise. the real question is rather: are iek views coherent? one smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride, but after the whole thing is over, some doubts remain. for example: while considering vertigo (58) iek states that what's hidden behind human face is a perfect void, which makes face itself only a facade: something of a deception in its own means. however, when in the final sequence we hear about the ever-shattering finale of city lights (31) as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another, it's hard not to ask: what happened to the whole facade-thing? why should we grant chaplin's face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive kim novak's of this same privilege in two bold strokes? or maybe that incoherence might also be read in lacan's terms? (the name of the notoriously "unreadable" french psychoanalyst is fundamental to iek's thought.) the film has all the virtues of a splendid two-and-a-half hours lecture: lots of ground are covered, many perspectives employed, even some first-rate wisecracks made (when iek travels on a melanie daniels' boat from the birds [63] and tries to think as she did, he comes up with: "i want to f**k mitch!"). but it has also one shortcoming that isn't inherent to two-and-a-half hours lecture as such: it's almost obsessively digressive. iek's yarn about how far are we from the real is as good as any other psychoanalytic yarn, but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of iek's perverse pleasures is to ramble on and on, changing subjects constantly. overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant, cool, fizzing wave: you're simultaneously taken by surprise, refreshed, in mortal danger and confused no end. as you finish watching, your head is brimming with ideas not of your own and you're already planning on re-watching some films  but you also share a sense of having survived a calamity.the ultimate question is: did iek lost it? or haven't we even came close to the real thing? once cinephilia becomes punishable by imprisonment, we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other (not having any movies around to turn our faces to). i dare you all: who will have enough guts to approach iek and defy him? my guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life, you become a believer.

human body --- wow.there are about 27,000 sunrises in human life....hardly one thousand sunrises will be watched by 90% of humans on this planet....our days are limited...excellent movie for all women.... makers of human body...thanks and regards.

actually, the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent imax movie that educates us on our delicate selves. c.g. and special cameras--assisted by imax--incredibly display the inner (and outer) workings of an average human, be it adult men and women, boys and girls, or babies. nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed: digestion, reproduction (featuring a marvin gaye hit), the heart, etc. some especially revealing moments include how an infant can be immersed underwater and also how the brain's impulses look. it is amazing how we function.the subject matter skips around an awful lot. but at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be *required* to know.

i've never been huge on imax films. they're cool, but once you get over that initial rush of "whoa, it feels like flying!" the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary. the exceptions have been the powerful "everest", the exhilarating "wild california" and now the bbc's "the human body", a super-sized look at the insides of our bodies. our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable. this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long, and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio, and most of us take it all for granted. here you can see the inside of a pumping heart (looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound, the development of a baby inside a mother's womb, and surprisingly, a few of the...um, less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from (pimples, the churning of acids in the stomach...)this film also has a rather funky style to it, which sets it apart from other imax documentaries. for instance, we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gaye's "let's get it on"? it's creative moments like that that make "the human body" not just a health lesson, but fun as well.

with very little screen time and money, dan katzir manages to do so much. this movie, in its heart-warming simplicity, touches the beauty of love from a fresh angle. rejuvinated lust

excellent film. i cried when she cried, i loved when they loved , i was frustrated when they were. this film touched my heart. it was a reality check for me since this is reality for me, a 19 year old soldier

touching; well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer. a love story with rabin's assassination in the background. worth seeing !

shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage. but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style. dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv, but besides, katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and, this people, far from being simple prominent figures, they speak to us from the heart. katzir's film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live, and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes. it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel, which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers, appears as a close and absolutly human reality, the reality of million people who looking for his place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it. katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world.

dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israel.for anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling. instantly, you are drawn in to dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved.you can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of dan's desperate, snatched relationship with iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable. if you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.

i've watched this movie twice, and i plan to see it again. it is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel. it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was, and the horrible murder described there. it is really worth watching.

one of the best records of israel's response to the murder of rabin.extremely true and natural, it captured the spirit of the nation.especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of israel's loss and the feeling that we shall overcome.

i think if you were to ask most jw's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find they do not. i know i do not. what you will find instead is that they believe the promises christ made of a resurrection. so, even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, jehovah can, and will correct this.it really gets down to a simple question: is god real to you or is this all just make believe? if he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be.i had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. one in my family was horrified when she saw the words "no blood" written in large letters over my chart. i reasoned with her that if i were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came? she didn't get it -- god just isn't real enough to her. too bad. i wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives.

felt it was very balanced in showing what jehovahs witnesses have done in protecting american freedoms. it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses. i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a jehovahs witness affects non-witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they don't celebrate holidays, the sad part is that non-witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners/visits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays. when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained, which would you prefer to treat your loved ones? i highly recommend this video!

i am one of jehovah's witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility. over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens, and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood. i have also heard several jehovah's witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen, leaving the question, "is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue?" the issue for jehovah's witnesses is a moral one. "you must abstain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement. thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it.

walking with cavemen, hosted by alec baldwin, is a look back at all the hominid (that's us!) species of the past 5 million years: who they were, what they were like, and how they died out. along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species, walking with cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human. i waited several weeks to watch this, and i was not disappointed.

i caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was. even when one of the two victims is at his most deteriorated, the camera keeps going. the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentration-camp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing. don't watch this movie if your already depressed. then again don't watch it if your feeling really good.

this film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. it -is- sad, because aids in the early '90s -was- sad. but its real message is one of love and perseverance.mark and tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of aids escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming.when "silverlake life" was originally released, i was deeply involved in hiv/aids education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an hiv/aids clinic. the film spoke to me like no other aids film of its day could, because mark and tom were real people, living the very experiences that i saw on a daily basis in real life. i knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch aids eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to mark and tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. it touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.

the saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and no-one felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards.made the same year as philadelphia...the tom hanks oscar-winner... this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to. there is more humanity, life, love, tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen... and it is all true.in order for this to be printed i need to leave a few more lines of text: suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60's and 70's, and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug "cocktails" allowed people to breathe a little easier... this is the film to see. oh, and i will add a personal comment about aids. despite everything, there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror. when aids first arrived, it was called the "gay cancer", and governments preferred to "let them die" rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags. then it became clear that aids would also be a heterosexual disease. but the government wasn't ready for that; so when straight people began getting ill too, the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves (examples: the names project: the quilt memorializing all those who died of aids; act up etc) the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them, because no other organizations existed. this close contact, in my estimation, is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals. when aids first came on the scene, many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us... and that probably would have been true if straights didn't suddenly become ill too; nevertheless, the strides that have been made in gay liberation - to the point that, as i write this, there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage - these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together. it is sad to think that all those people - both straight and gay - had to die before our common humanity became more obvious - but if what i am writing here is true, and i think it is - then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain.

this documentary is incredibly thought-provoking, bringing you in to the lives of two long-time lovers who are in the final stages of aids. the past footage of their twenty-some-odd years together really brings their final moments home.if this movie doesn't make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people, you don't have a heart.

silverlake life, the view from here, is an absolutely stunning movie about aids as well as about a gay love relationship. some images are indeed really hard to take, especially when one is gay or fears about aids, and probably for any sensitive person watching it. it's not easy to make a movie about such a terrible illness and its consequences about not only one, but two people's lives. this movie teaches how to care for each other in such hard times, but it never gets too morbid, it still shows life at any time, reminding you that outside of the theater or of your room, life goes on, whatever the destiny of some people may be. the characters are incredibly endearing, while we watch their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit, never unveiling anything too private or offensive. children should certainly not watch this movie, but grown-ups whether they have to deal with such situations or not, should do it, and will not regret the tears they shed.

"silverlake life" is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward. actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illuminations, see something else. and it's by no means a tearjerker. but i mean that in positive ways. it shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with aids is affecting the quality of their every-day lives. it's almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not, because it was so undressed that i had to look for other ways to respond. it's an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents i've ever seen. these two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. it makes hollow-wood productions on aids seem hip and heartless. these men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. the scene where tom sings "you are my sunshine" to mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing.

this is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life. to put it in perspective it was when gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution, and not just gay as a descriptor. or is it still used that way today? i believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989. it was released in 1993, so it's been around.i was touched by the documentaries capturing of one man's love for another over a 20 some odd year period. a love expressed in ways that only true love can be. there are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. there are scenes of life as a homo-sexual and life as a gay. the film itself was a work of love, and i believe it to be a diamond.at the very least one will get out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of aids. as i write this, i am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set. the advances in medical, political, and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film was set (some 15 years ago) are amazing. however, obviously, in the case of the disease of aids itself, we are not done yet. heck i guess we aren't done on all fronts.anyway, it's just a pretty darn good documentary. i'd encourage anyone that feels that they don't quite understand gay life, gay issues, or the devastation of aids to watch this film.

this is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of aids. it's a documentary about two men living with and dying of this illness. the film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, and incredibly moving. above all, it is an amazing true love story. be sure to have a few hankies ready before you watch this movie---you will need them. extraordinary.

i love paul mccartney. he is, in my oppinion, the greatest of all time. i could not, however, afford a ticket to his concert at the tacoma dome during the back in the u.s. tour. i was upset to say the least. then i found this dvd. it was almost as good as being there. paul is still the man and i will enjoy this for years to come. i do have one complaint. i would of like to hear all of hey jude.also paul is not dead.the single greatest concert dvd ever.***** out of *****.

this is a great film for mccartney's and beatles fans!a splendid time is guaranteed for all.the audience (feat some celebrities such as nicholson ,cuzak,michael douglas) is ,as always,quite amazing:from small children to old campaigners of the sixties.they know the words to all the songs by heart ,and some of them are crying when paul breaks into "blackbird" "yesterday " "all my loving" and all the treasures of his catalog (who ,except john lennon and dylan ,can claim such a repertoire?).there are two particularly moving moments:-the double tribute to lennon and harrison;first "here today" performed solo (the title was included in "tug of war" 1982 and was its best track),then "something" when paul uses an ukulele.-"the long and winding road" rendition,a key moment,when paul's voice cracks ,as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stage.i remember,in the early seventies ,when people used to despise paul ,cause he was not involved in politics,as his ex-partner was.they had to change their mind for paul is a committed artist: "fame is great cause it allows charity".the film shows different aspects of paul's activities ,an artist who is anything but selfish.

this is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear. i grew up when all my lovin' was brand new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir p mc's power to spellbind any crowd of any age. this doco goes way behind the scenes to show us life on the road not just for the band but everyone down to the roadies. i saw this guy live in aussie 1975 and can assure you his performance here on this dvd is no less than he gave almost 30 years ago. i have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does do this justice and would recommend this anyone especially a beatles fan. this is the closest you will get to a beatles concert today. singer, songwriter, lead/rhythm/ bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. there are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in his hand. if you want note perfect music, buy a studio recorded cd. if you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd, with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd-this dvd is for you.

we toss around the term "superstar" way too lightly these days, but here's one guy that truly deserves it.i was glued to the set this entire show. the song selection was perfect -- it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs. i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (with songs of this strength, you don't need a circus to be entertained).the shots of the crowd were amazing, too. how many performers can affect the original beatles fans (now in their 50's and beyond), get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of "can't buy me love" and impact everyone in between? while watching, i also realized that in the wake of john lennon's tragic death, paul mccartney instantly became an afterthought. paul not only lost john and george (no matter what their final relations were, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment lennon's murder received. i agree that lennon's murder was horrible, but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath. i was very happy that he's found love again in heather.as for those complaining about the audio/video quality, i had no complaints whatsoever; both were crystal clear on my set. i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out; they'll never be satisfied.my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance. thanks to this video i was able to enjoy it.when people remember john lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. i now have a new appreciation for paul mccartney, because, if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. and let's hope another lunatic won't change this, because the mccartney catalog is pretty good.

eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show.i love his impressions of mr. t,ed norton and ralph cramden of "the honeymooners",elvis presley,and michael jackson too.the ice cream man,goony goo goo,is also funny.i saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984.i laughed so hard,i almost fell off my chair.i still think this is very funny.eddie murphy,when he was on "saturday night live",made me laugh so hard,he is one of the best people to come out of"saturday night live"."eddie murphy delirious"is his best stand up performance next to "eddie murphy raw".i give "eddie murphy delirious" 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.

rated nr(would be rated r for pervasive strong language and crude sexual humor). quebec rating:16+(should be 13+) canadian home video rating:18aeddie murphy delirious is eddie's first stand up comedy routine.this came out in 1983.back then he starred in the movie 48 hrs and trading places and he was on saturday night live.eddie made two stand up comedy films.delirious and raw.i preferred raw because i just found the subject matter to be more humorous.delirious however is also very funny with eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities such as mr.t and singers such as michael jackson.any fan of stand-up comedy films should see eddie murphy's delirious.

during eddie murphy's stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds. what is said is,, women - do mr rob (this is a character from saturday night live), the man responds with shut up bitch. unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby, this is incorrect, although the post-er said he was there they must have a hearing problem! despite what the post-er says about not being able to here it on dvd have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the dvd - do mr rob!!!! i hope this helps anyone curious out the outburst cheers gaz!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!

... it even beats the nasty "raw". almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night. it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes(old school)and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family. he was only 22-years old then and this is a must-see!8/10

this video is so hilariously funny, it makes everything elseby eddie murphy seem very disappointing (even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor, which just goes to show you how good this really is). to be honest, i don't think that i've everlaughed at something as much as this, including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse. this show is amazing, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with m) but it didn't bother me. see it, the funniest thing i've ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too.

eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand-up concert film i have ever seen. most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point, but not this one folks. for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side-splittingly funny. from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead-on impression of mr.t, the laughs are non-stop.sadly, this was done in 1983, and eddie hasn't done anything nearly as funny. it's unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show, wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all.eddie, if you're out there, please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious. believe me your fans will love you for it. and i think you know that.

this was the funniest piece of film/tape i have ever witnessed, bar none. i laughed myself sick the first three times i watched it. i recommend it to everyone, with the warning that if they can't handle the f-sharps to stay far away. at his best when telling stories from a kids point of view.

the film is side spliting from the outset, eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together. the film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it. so hints are very welcome. if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and see's the video get it,it is worth the money and can't go far wrong.

eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life. when i saw it for the first time about 2 years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it. to date i have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time. for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar. there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle. if you are not the sort of person who can't stand swearing then i wouldn't advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5-10 seconds. i gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best.

i have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but this one is so original, so fresh, it will make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store. murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just too funny to pass. if only every movie could be this funny. it should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" murphy is a comic genius in this film and will make you say "this is the guy that did dr. doulittle!" he talkes about the ice cream man, shoe throwing mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism, and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldnt. please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it, if only all movies could be delirious.

if you ever see a stand up comedy movie this is the one. you will laugh nonstop if you have any sense of humor at all. this is a once in a lifetime performance from a once in a lifetime performer. this is a stand up standard.

and gi joe go stuck in the water, i die of laufther every time i see this movie, and then a big brown shark came, this is comedy at it's best, this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else, andrew dice clay, jerry, tucker, rock, they can't thouch the man the myth the legend eddie murphy,yo eddie we want moremore more more more more more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

eddie murphy delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life. you can compare it to any movie, and i garuntee you will decide that delirious is the funniest movie ever! this movie is about 1hr. 45 mins., and throughout that time, there was barely a moment where i wasn't laughing. you will laugh for hours after it is over, replaying the punch lines over and over and over in your head. eddie murphy has given so many funny performances over his career (48 hrs.,trading places,beverly hills cop,raw,coming to america, the nutty professor,shrek,etc.),but this is by far his most hilarious moment. i have seen this movie so many times, and it is funnier every time. it never loses its edge. from this day forward, every great stand up performance will be emulated from delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!

if only eddie murphy were born 10 years later. then we'd all remember it. but even i was only 4 when it came out. if you haven't seen it yet, rent dr. dolittle, showtime, i spy, pluto nash and all eddie's family comedy movies - then watch this. hands down, you'll laugh 90% of the time. the other 10% you'll be wiping the tears from your eyes.it really needs to be watched more then once to understand all the jokes. from crude humor to a joke for kids!(if you've seen it you'll laugh here) - you'll love his stuff. if you can, (or are a big fan) try to download clips from eddie's acts. allot of the shows are different as you'd imagine and he has even more funny jokes.but this is like the "best of" eddie murphy 'x-rated' if you will.and all i can say is please don't watch delirious if you don't like comedy, don't have a sense of humor or are not fun to hang out with. you will only put down this great eddie murphy classic and possibly make someone miss out on it.if you wanna know how eddie got beverly hills cop and got famous from it- delirious is it.

i know it's crude, and i know that it isn't at all pc, but it's so funny. if you can put it into perspective that it's from the early 80's and it carries all the stereotypes of the time--and the movie still makes you almost pass out with laughter--than it is truly a good comedy. going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject matter of this film is exagerated. if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to have an all-out laugh, than please watch this.p.s. would someone please put this out on dvd, it's so hard to find on vhs anymore.

so terrific, so good. i have never seen a man be more funny than eddie murphy. in this stand-up-comedy you will see a lot of imitations more done by anyone!if you have seen raw (1987) you will have to see delirious. it's so funny! it's so professional!

eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably the funniest. delirious is the best stand-up comedy i've ever seen and it is a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh!! i've watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it - i still have side-splitting fun. this is definitely one for your video library. i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much - that you will miss half of them! delirious is hilarious!although there are a lot of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them will seem like second-class citizens. if you have never seen it - get it, watch it - and you will love it!! it will make you holler!!! :-)

the first time i came upon delirious, i only heard it. i listened to the entire comedic performance and never have i laughed so much in my life. eddie's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating. when i finally got to see him perform this act, i had to have it. eddie murphy's performance on delirious shows his genius! with it being the new millennium, his acts in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then. my parents loved it as teenagers and i (age eighteen) love it as well. from that point on, i had to view murphy's other movies such as coming to america and harlem nights. there will be no other comedian like eddie.

this is the ultimate one-man show in which eddie murphy is at his very best. just forget the nutty professor and the distinguished gentlemen, this is the real eddie murphy. his imitations of mr. t. (pretending he is gay), michael jackson and other artists are killers. i think it's also quite daring to make fun of artists who where really popular in that time. my favorite act is the one where he is at his annual bbq with the family and plays his drunken dad and aunt bunny who falls from the stairs.this show is the best medicine when you feel down ! if you watch the sequel 'raw' don't be disappointed. it's quite good too but doesn't match 'delirious'.

lol!!! delirious was so funny.. i was in tears. eddie murphys impressions are absolutely spot on. the best impression was of james brown and mr t> so funny!! its weird how eddie murphy was back then and how he is now delirious is a must see but if u don't like foul language don't watch but amazing and so funny.. i have seen it 6/7 times and still pee myself every time.. this is eddie murphy at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from. he does impressions of his family as well, which is real funny.if only i was there...

i think this still is the best routine. there are some others, like rock's "bring the pain", and allen's "men are pigs" that are hilarious; "damon waynes last stand" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no errors. all the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. just long enough to last 20 years. i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool. not putting in a category with ellen and newhart, but something you can watch if you're bloated. thanks eddie, god bless.

this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever. i've seen a lot of stand up shows ,been to a lot of stand up shows, and watch bet's comic view, but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show. the impressions are excellent, the skits are great, and the timing is perfect. you can even tell the crowd gets really into. when he did raw a few years later it was also really good, but this is # 1 in my book. also shows that at one time, particularly the early-to mid eighties, that murphy was funny. my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and "ice cream !!! mooommmm!! the ice cream man is coming !!!!" another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood.

i watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides laughing each time. i love eddie murphy as an actor, but this stand up is some thing else. he is so funny. even the p.c. brigade would find this hilarious. it's a must watch, and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink. the take off of michael jackson is so like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing. the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny. my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour. anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.

i've never laughed and giggled so much in my life! the first half kept me in stitches; the last half made me come completely unglued! i think i giggled for 15 minutes after the tape was over.his timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled. and though he talks fast, you catch every joke. which is probably why my "laugh center" was so overwhelmed; it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything.

if you haven't seen this, you do not know what you are missing. the first time you do, you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard, and having probably wet yourself as well.it is that funny. there hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that i have seen that tops this or even comes close. so many classic one liners, stories, and segways..the drunken uncle at the bbq, gi joe, mr t, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and i'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act.pure classic!! shame you can't get it on dvd..rating 10+ out of 10

it should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with eddie murphy. i have never seen anything like it.murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and insaults so many famous people including his own "family". among the people who gets it by murphy are: elvis, mr.t, michael jackson, stevie wonder, mick jagger, luther vandross and james brown. i have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life. i mean, when a person doesn't know who mr. t is, but still laughs so hard of murphy as mr. t, there's something about it. at the time i saw the show i couldn't remember who mr t. was but still laughed. now i know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny. because that's what eddie do - he can make those impressions so good that it don't matter who the hell he's trying to do, it's still hilarious. and on top of that, we learn that murphy actually is a very good singer. please watch it..

this is the funniest stand up i have ever seen and i think it is the funniest i will ever see. if you don't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity, then this is just not your cup of tea. but i honestly don't know anyone who has seen this that hasn't liked it. it is now 17 years later and my friends and i still quote everything from goonie goo goo to the fart game, aunt bunnie to the ice cream man, ralph and ed to get out!! there are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly haven't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever. take any of robin williams, damon wayans, the dice, george carlin or even the greats like richard pryor or red foxx and this will surpass it. i don't know how or where murphy got some of his material but it works. that is what it comes down to. it is funny as hell.could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to eddie doing buckwheat and mr. rogers and such on snl? if you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the f-word for the first time, they are in complete shock.his first time he says the f-word is when he does the skit about mr. t being a homosexual." hey boy, hey boy. you look mighty cute in them jeans. now come on over here, and f@** me up the ass!"the crowd erupts in gales of laughter. no one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them. but the results were just awesome. i have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way i was in this stand-up. in fact, the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing wasn't until 1999 when i saw south park: bigger longer and uncut . that comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular, as did delirious. i don't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh. it is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video." i took your kids fishing last week. and i put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes gus. normal kids don't do shit like that gus. then they started movin their heads around like this and the m****f***** come up with fish. then they looked at each other and said goonie goo goo! i said can you believe this f****n shit?!"see it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off!10 out of 10

if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd, it was probably 'delirious' you were looking for. how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines? i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time, and when i was old enough to see eddie murphy's 'delirious' and 'raw' (not as funny) i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration. now that i'm older, and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy, i realize two things: everybody steals from eddie, while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard. that's the huge difference: eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful  and more. he was something never before seen. he was all we ever needed. these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king, and 'delirious' was the greatest castle ever built. truly one of the funniest routines of all time.

yes, this gets the full ten stars. it's plain as day that this fill is genius. the universe sent trent harris a young, wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape, in all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake. too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow's story. the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story, with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men, respectively. the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling, giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america. recommended for anyone and everyone!

the short that starts this film is the true footage of a guy named gary, apparently it was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where gary works in the town of beaver. gary is a little "different"; he is an impersonator and drives an old chevy named farrah (after fawcett). lo and behold the filmmaker gets a letter from gary some time later inviting him to return to beaver to get some footage of the local talent contest he has put together, including gary's staggering performace as olivia newton dawn. oh, my. the two shorts that follow are gary's story, the same one you just witnessed only the first is portrayed by sean penn and the second by crispin glover titled "the orkly kid." if you are in the mood for making fun of someone this is definitely the film to watch. i was doubled over with laughter through most of it, especially crispins performance which could definitely stand on it's own. when it was over, i had to rewind the film to once again watch the real gary and all his shining idiocy. although olivia was the focus, i would have liked to have seen one of the "fictitious" shorts take a jab at gary's barry manilow impersonation, whic h was equally ridiculous.

there has never been anything like it, that's for sure. this episodic, seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole, and as such it is not a movie about groovin' gary, utah cross-dressing sensation. it is very self-consciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin' gary. for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance. he's trying to atone for his sins - yes, gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired - through correction, commentary, and convention, reclaiming such hollywood-narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending (two different ones, with a telling adjustment in the glover version) and turning them to his own very personal uses. so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference, the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies - but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity. there is just so much going on; in telling and re-telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and he doesn't miss the opportunity to make something of it. immensely moving, and as profound as camp ever gets.

the beaver trilogy is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. i was lucky enough to catch it, along with a q&a session with director trent harris, at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trent's website. this movie has to be seen to be believed! i sincerely recommend searching for trent's name on the web and then buying the film from his site. he's an incredibly nice guy to boot. don't get confused: the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trent!after having seen the trilogy a few times, i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version. it's like a try-out version for the crispin glover "orkly kid" section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a penn fan than it being a good video. penn is pretty funny, though, and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty b&w video.this is probably also one of crispin glover's best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin' gary. once you see this film, you'll never get gary's nervous laughter out of your head ever again.

this movie is amazing for several reasons. harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. groovin' gary is a small-town kid who is (assumed) well-liked for his many impersonations. when he decides to play olivia newton john in a local talent show (for whom he is very passionate), gary's actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives. this results in him making various justifications for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast. in the second installment, harris exploites the struggle between gary and beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary. the third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for harris' extreme sensitivity with the subject. unlike the second installment, "the orkly kid" shows gary as a truly troubled character. he struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail. his secret passion for dressing like olivia newton john distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast. the movie is depicted so realistically that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. surely, one can see gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but may also identify with him as an outcast.

if you are a crispin glover fan, you must see this. if you are a sean penn fan, you must see this. if you are a movie fan in general, you must see this. if you have no idea who crispin glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is, this film will probably still have a lot of value, but the more work you've previously seen by crispin or sean, the better.this movie is so funny, but it is also pure genius. there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film. it is its own genre. i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again. i cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that. in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review, i ask that you view the film again. in reality, there is no point at which this film could fairly be called "boring." this is possibly the funniest, most entertaining, and least boring film ever made. and it only gets better with age and repeated viewings. a timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim to have seen.beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris, also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed, which crispin glover also stars in.unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find. i managed to find a vhs version after some diligent searching though, and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of. but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd.

this is how i felt while watching this film. i loved it. it was hilarious. but i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody's psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point. a friend put it this way:"i feel like we broke into somebody's house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge".another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film. "groovin' gary", the original "beaver kid", is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby tv station in the hope of getting on film - and he certainly does, though not, perhaps, as he initially expected. with high hopes of fame and significance he invites harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that he has organised in his home town - headlined by his own drag act "olivia newton-don". director, trent harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town america. harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town america, the cult of celebrity, and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry.both sean penn and grispin glover pull out stunner performances. a young sean penn is the most evocative - so closely does he follow the actual 'gary footage', but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way harris wants it to go.in the end the wide-eyed naivety the original gary is what moved me - when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situation.a film not to miss. i have not seen anything else like it.jacob.

after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy, bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler: diva las vegas, a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas. midler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's, proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business. from her opening number, her classic "friends", where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud, bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called "i look good" she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections. the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage (even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it, but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical). bette also treats us to "rose's turn" from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club. she brings the house down near the end with "stay with me, baby" from the rose and her only #1 hit record, "wind beneath my wings" from beaches. it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans, it's a must.

a longtime fan of bette midler, i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites. bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. a literal rainbow of emotion and talent, bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the "bette of roses" album. spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone. the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around.

love it, love it, love it! this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m. from the beginning to the end, this is one big treat! don't rent it- buy it now!

bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in "diva las vegas". i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to. she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you. the highlight of the show was her singing "stay with me" from her 1979 movie "the rose". you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps. the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler's albums.

bette midler is indescribable in this concert. she gives her all every time she is on stage. whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, bette midler moves her audience. if you can't see it live (which is the best way to see bette) then this is the next best thing. an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. her more "vocally correct" version of "stay with me" never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness, here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. i will treasure this concert for a very long time.

bette midler is again divine! raunchily humorous. in love with burlesque. capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever. all in all singing new ballads, power-singing the good old/perennial ones such as "the rose"; "stay with me" and yes, even "wind beneath my wings". the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it, i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries!

documenting a documenter. that's one way to describe keep the river on your right: a modern cannibal tale. this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to west papua and then peru. tobias is a full-bodied character: a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for. author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru, tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become. yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch. one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves.tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. this film challenges the notions of morality and "naturalness"- e.g. nudity, homosexuality, cannibalism. (watch for the graphic circumcision scene). when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce, his non-judgmental nature asks: "why not?" who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types, but also those interested in the art of documentary making. this film shows what can be done shot on video. the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination. at times, he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back, especially considering his age and physical frailty. we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself, perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world. the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance, presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings (of homosexuality in this case) based on his personal interests. that said, you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle. move over river queen, this is the best river ride i've taken in a while.

i saw this film at amsterdam's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum, all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers. the film's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving. i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.

i read schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. his subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man, but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies. even so, schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.

just got out and cannot believe what a brilliant documentary this is. rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and amazement. lately movies have become so over hyped that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens. amores perros did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now. i didn't know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise. if you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those touchy movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in. fortunetly this is not that movie. the people tell the story! this does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them. there is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense. touching the void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story. i just saw it today but i will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen.

this interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind tibetan children trekking in the himalayas; but also of a personality clash between two remarkable people. on one hand, there is erik weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb everest, and the team of (sighted) mountaineers who are guiding the kids. on the other, there is sabriye tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind tibetans, who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is progressing. at some level, sabine simply doesn't understand the mountaineer's philosophy (with it's emphasis on summitting); she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers goals and the desires of the children but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with, especially as she has an effective veto. in the background to this (reasonably well-mannered) clash, we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves. i enjoyed the film, although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifting - even though it details the quarrel, the film somewhat relentlessly asserts how amazing all those who feature in it are. but it's hard to argue with that assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat unsubtly.

this film was amazing. it is an inspiring piece of cinema. the characters are fully developed through the truth in which director, lucy walker brings to the film. i highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition. lucy wlaker showcases the landscape beauty. this film id a true example of man vs. nature and sometimes man vs. man. the inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter. the subject of how the tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. this film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased. lucy walker has given erik weihenmayer a voice when he would have not normally been heard. thank you lucy for being true to your vison as a filmmaker.

i saw this film at the toronto international film festival. i loved this, and not just for the obvious reasons. blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of mount everest's sister peaks. now, this kind of thing is usually a can't miss. inspirational. moving. pretty standard, right? and even if the film were just that, i'd still have liked it. but it was so much more. blind herself, german sabriye tenberken established a school for blind children in tibet, in a culture that sees blindness as a curse, as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life. many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives, and at best, are a burden to their families. as part of their education, tenberken shares with them the story of american erik weihenmayer, the first blind person to reach the summit of mount everest. she sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students. instead, he comes up with a plan. he'll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23,000 foot lhakpa ri and provide all the guides and equipment. sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts.erik's team are mostly american, mostly male, and mostly sighted. as experienced mountaineers, they're type-a personalities, very gung-ho and goal-oriented. sabriye is european, female, and blind, and the students for her are more than a "project," no matter how well-intentioned. additionally, the students are tibetan, and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves. as the expedition unfolds, they become pawns in between the two adult "sides," wanting to please both, while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment. as an additional obstacle (other than being blind, that is), they are speaking english as a second or in most cases, a third language, and struggle to understand and make themselves understood.when it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience, and that some are much more coordinated than others, it begins to unravel erik's original plan for them all to reach the summit together. as both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude, decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain. among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability, and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults. at the risk of oversimplifying, on one side are those for whom the destination is all, and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey. i won't tell you how it all turns out, except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought-provoking stories i've seen in a long time.the film also weaves bits of each climber's story into the narrative, and this was sorely needed, since once on the climb, the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut. with all the drama going on around them, that wasn't surprising. the backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking, and i found it very strange that i found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end. this was contrary to my expectations, and another pleasant surprise.in addition to all the human drama to cover, director walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen-deprived conditions herself, lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn't break down. as with all great documentaries, the filmmaker was just lucky enough (or smart enough, or prepared enough) to be at the right place at the right time, and she's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do "what's best for the kids" as it does about the kids themselves.

before seeing this, i was put off by the subject matter, but this is not your average triumph over adversity story. although this is technically about blind tibetan kids climbing mt. everest, there is so much more to it. this movie shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children, erik and sabriye. erik is an american blind mountain climber/athlete and sabriye is a blind german academic who started a school in lhasa tibet. they are both exceptional in their own ways, but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids. erik wants them to reach the summit while sabriye wants them to enjoy erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment. the nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. the most profound scenes are with the tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school. the most moving for me was the story of tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. i could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school, he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students. if you liked spellbound or murderball, you will love this.

the hip hop rendition of a mos def performance (according to the film's musical credits)...it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each "snap" if anyone can tell me someplace this song, "live wire snap" by mos def from "the ground truth", an undeniable duty to see as the americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of purpose...they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry..."live wire snap" by mos def, where can it be founddesperate to find it :medically unable to serve

having just "welcomed home" my 23 yr old daughter from a year in iraq, camp anaconda medical support unit, i felt compelled to get this dvd. i wanted to hear other returning vets feelings in order to attempt to better understand her mentality on arrival and not waiting until after something bad happened. regardless on your take on the war and peace this movie serves as a great start for all americans to begin the healing of our returning vets emotional void. the paramount statement of the entire movie is "take action" on the problem . incredibly emotional movie. i would highly recommend this movie to the vet the vets entire mature family and ask that they follow through with a plan to listen comfort help the returning gulf war enduring freedom vets.fast forward nearly one year later & my daughter has seen this dvd. took account of her emotions and actually has made a commitment to re-up for another 6 years. her take on her time spent in the sand is that she did some good. local balad children got first rate medical treatment for various common ailments not ordinarily able to afford free with an escort and translator. her look over her shoulder at her iraq tour was . "we changed some hearts and minds back there" great dvd you have to keep an open mind and see all sides

this movie is a must-see movie for all. congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier, as should everyone in america. the previous reviewer totally missed the point--the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but who just live in our "enemy's" territory, and what it does to the soldiers. we must support our troops by bringing them home immediately, before another person is killed or injured. this also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are injured mentally, with ptsd- post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. julie a. roberts, streamwood, il

this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum. it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq, god rest the souls of the 350,000 plus that have been killed, had anything to do with terrorism nor al-quida.following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of "loose change." this movie is available free on the internet, until the bush cabal locks it down, by googling-up the very title, as indicated in parenthesis.god save our country. this will not be done by following the christo-fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over 10 years prior to november, 2006!

i desperately need this on a tape, not a dvd, and soon!i have one nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet deployed, although he set to go to iraq soon after december 2008. i lost my beloved step son in ramadi iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone. i have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has some idealized and romanticized idea about what serving in the military is. my stepson died after only 10 days in country and he never went out on any missions so my nephews have no way to reference any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary from any type of personal experiences that might have been conveyed by my now deceased son. there is nothing i can do about those who are in, or now gone, but i have one left that has not raised his hand and been sworn in yet. i desperately want him to do so informed, none of the others did.pleases help me with this.the movie documentary the ground truth is the best visual reference i have ever seen. i need to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he is getting himself into before it is to late. but: ( do not laugh )i need my mother to see this first. she must actually see and hear these men and women, not simply the idea of them, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this film and once he has then he may then make his son, my youngest nephew, watch it too. then, my nephew might begin to take this seriously. ((( is there another time when this will be shown on tv ? if so please tell me when ? )))however, my problem is, my mother does not own a dvd player, she still uses video ( is that correct? with tapes ? ) so, i need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film. can i purchase this from anyone in that form? if not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from anyone? is there any legitimate link from which i can pay to download it onto my computer and then transfer it to a tape. if so who would i contact. i will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link. or,if you have any alternative ideas i will consider anything you can suggest.please help me, i have lost one very precious adored and loved one already, i already know my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and i may loose him too. i cannot loose three and the emotional toll for all of those that do make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. please help me. i will happily call you, email me a number if that is the best way to get the needed information. thank you so much for any help you can offer.sincerely, lori swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com

do not expect a depiction of the "truth". however, the accounts of these veterans of the iraqi & afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration. the major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives. my major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and veterans affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war. these are not fatal flaws of the film.as a veteran myself, i know that the horrible aftermath of war is real, and these young men and women articulate it very well. these vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.

the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately. the walter reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return.what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars. the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life. they are not just changed or affected, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves.finally, this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma.we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war. it doesn't matter what side you are on, it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business. this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly.

there is an episode of the simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a "killbot factory". here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke, but what patricia foulkrod's documentary does is show us, scarily, that it is not that far from the truth. after world war two the us army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war; that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of 'me or them'. since then the training process of the us army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who don't think of combatants as people. to develop in them a most unnatural state: "the sustainable urge to kill".first off, this isn't an antiwar movie as such. whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light, foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that doesn't get as much media attention as, say, the debate over the legality of a war or it's physical successes or failures; the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being. it's the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves, and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current middle east conflict foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts, especially vietnam, painfully clear. this isn't about any particular war, it's about the problems caused by war in general.structurally the film seems to be split into three sections; how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive, how they are treated once they are in combat, and what happens once they leave the army. once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced, policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals. those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple, how word like "democracy" and "freedom" are banded around, but once the training begins they become "enemy" and "kill" and "destroy". how once in action soldiers don't care what they are ordered to do, as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order, whatever it may be, they are one step closer to going home. they have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as that's what they've been trained to do.but the ground truth's main goal is to highlight the way the us army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home. there is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning, and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done, and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up. this is the final indignity, that once they are used they are cast away.if there is a flaw in the film it is that foulkrod doesn't attempt to show another side to the argument. you would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with post traumatic stress syndrome. it would have been interesting to see those of a less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies. there is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself known.but other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary, and foulkrod's use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war.

that is no criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past. i recently watched winter soldier, and the ground truth was like watching a remake or sequel-- except it was about iraq rather than vietnam. similar to winter soldier because of it's one-sided message, both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering. both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines, but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for. this is ultimately what lost the war in vietnam, and will likely lose the war in iraq as well. my only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided it could be easily passed off as left- wing propaganda. not by me, mind you, but by those aiming to discredit the film and message. a more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience.

this film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. for many soldiers, men and women alike, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. i am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from wwii. for one of my uncles the war was never over. he survived the d-day invasion, something akin to the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan. for him the memories not only lingered but tortured him. he became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins, his sons. jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. when i saw this at the kc filmfest, i was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change. the idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in iraq, and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right.the tag line from the vietnam war film platoon says it all. "the first casualty of war is innocence."

i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine. i didn't know what to expect, i'd not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what. all in all, it is very well done. it doesn't focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which to me, left the politics out of it. the soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp, and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life. it was really good to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war, but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals. make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls.

i saw this film premiere friday (1/19) night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved. sitting in a theater and hearing first-hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear. others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away, the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us. robert acosta, paul rieckhoff, sean huze, and herold noel, all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film, were present. while they may be home now, you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be. whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. see this film!

i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has. it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it. the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into "killers for their country" and put into the war and the after effects once they return home. it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche. it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films, instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vets.this film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought provoking. it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them, and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing ends.the best film of the festival so far, ****/****

i watched this tape, immediately rewound it, watched it again and laughed twice as hard. i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of, but uncomfortable around transvestites. it shows you that transvestitism is a feature, rather than the entirety of one's being. the comedy is not single issue. this man is brilliant. all comics should aspire to his level of candor, intelligence and talent.

until i saw this special on hbo, i had never heard of eddie izzard. i sure am glad that i have now! he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen! rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie. i could not stop laughing for the entire show. if you like to laugh you have to see this special!

izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor. he definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world.it's a pity more americans won't see this stand-up routine due to its pal-only availability.

i was first introduced to "eddie" by friends from "across-the-pond" who know i like intelligent humor. i prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as george carlin and dennis miller. in 'dress to kill' eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time. there is a wide range of subjects in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. the piece on how to decide on englebert's stage name will leave you in stitches!thanks andrew and catherine! ... and "do you have a flag?"

eddie izzard is genius with his non-stop humor. i could listen all day. his unique approach to life is quite logical. his understanding of discovery (such as the heimlich maneuver) is creative. eddie izzard captures the heart of what we think. i don't know when i laughed so hard at anyone's off-beat mind.

i managed to tape this off my satellite, but i would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the states. eddie truly is glorious in this performance from san francisco. i don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine. my wife and i both enjoyed this tape and his work on glorious i just wish i could buy a copy and help support eddie financially through my purchase. we need more of his shows available.

this is definatley one of the best stand-up shows evre. ever. eddie is so off the wall that i've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now, and it still rocks every single time. just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks, it's a masterpeice. you need look no further than this line "the word herb. you say erb, and we say herb, cuz ther's a f###ing h in it". brilliant.

eddie izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius, and this is eddie at his very best. his material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage. instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences, hitler, the moon landing, and the british. with so many memorable laughs, one can't help but repeat some of his lines. forever more, "do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see "dress to kill". by far the best british standup comedian i've ever witnessed, eddie izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage. however, his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is. "dress to kill" is a treasure, one that luckily has found its way to home video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again.

this is an excellent stand-up dvd! eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years. his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it. i highly recommend this one. the part about the history of europe is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in french are quite good, because you don't have to speak french to get it (although if you do, it is still hilarious). also, the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. the first scene (about san francisco) is not great, but funny the first time. skip over those if you can. it's almost not worth watching. however, this really is a funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. "i was dead at the time!"

one of the best comedians ever. i've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more. my friends and family quote from this dvd so often, you'd think we did nothing other than watch it. the beginning part about alcatraz is a little bit slow, but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where eddie is on stage. watch for the "cake or death" part (joking about the church of england) and the "hitler/pol pot" part (hard to explain, just watch it). the best part of the show may be eddie's facial expressions. he can really say a lot with his eyes. (mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably help, huh?) fair warning: eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words in.

right, then, he's absolutely brilliant. but you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor. he covers (attacks?) all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, easter/christmas, transvestitism, movies, and herr doktor heimlich.for those of you are averse to swearing, this isn't for you. while some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the f-word. also, if you can't laugh at yourself, never watch this; you will feel the fool.incidentally, i've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his best work. he simply shines.what might go so far as to say he is glorious.

what more could anyone want? he's a history lesson, foreign language tutor, nra representative and ambassador to burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels. i laughed so hard i left a puddle. his woes about puberty, transvestism, public school, and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand-up routine i have ever seen. i think about it now, years later when i see cake (tea and cake or death) and hear something translated into french (the mouse is under the table, the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch. i like his versions of what jerry dorsey could have been named before he settled on englebert humperdinck. i really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy. he has a lot to teach us, and a wonderful way of telling it. thanks for your time.

i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time. i have not done so ever since.the strange thing is, i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again, and again. eddie izzard is cultivated, is poignant, is a man of the world. he is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to "engage" in political discussion. he is above that. i would contrast him to george carlin, who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas, and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain.funniest guy on earth

a bit of trivia b/c i can't figure out how to submit trivia: in the backdrop of this performance, one of the images isgeorge serat's "a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte" painting (seen best in chapter 18), this painting is the subject of a sonheim musical sunday in the park with george.a bit of trivia b/c i can't figure out how to submit trivia: in the backdrop of this performance, one of the images isgeorge serat's "a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte" painting (seen best in chapter 18), this painting is the subject of a sonheim musical sunday in the park with george.

some people loved "the aristocrats" and others hated it, frequently walking out in the middle. reactions to eddie izzard aren't likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, shall we say, enough use of the "f" word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television. many of izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances. on the other hand, i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and, in spots, absolutely hilarious. he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines. he's not a story teller. he's not a joke maker. he's not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams. he plays around with ideas, some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz, for instance -- are completely unfunny. he has a way, however, of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect. i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8. but a 10? no way.

this video was my first exposure to eddie izzard. we had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channel-surfed to hbo during the course of the evening. someone by the name of "eddie izzard" was on.i tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes. i didn't want to be held "responsible" for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me. after holding in my laughs for more than was healthful, i let go--as did the others of us(we were not stoned, by the way, nor talking of insurance and pensions...). we were asphyxiated after that. the story lines, the plot, the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance. i have since been addicted to every eddie-izzard-piece-of-comedy i can get my hands on. his work is sheer genius. his comedy appears effortless. he seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or that...it's convulsively funny. he gives you the impression that the joke is between you .. and himself, the only true aficionados of humor, after all. if you are disappointed in this video, you have no sense of the penultimate in humor--or humour, as they say in the uk.

hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour-de-star-wars-force (luke: how strong? vader: the strength of a small pony), in which, being the master he is, he doesn't even break a sweat, ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage.. -and that's with almost 2 hours of whirling his way thru history, its birthplace, europe, and more.from heimlich's middle-of-the-night, "i've invented a maneuver!" to the british empire's "..do you have a flag..?" and ancient deadbeat gods, "jeff! the god of biscuits!" and many more, this is fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jumpstart-your-lungs funny.and i confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years, seeing as a british transvestite standup, vogueing on a chair, is one longshot of a rental after all, especially one going back 10 years now. and yet, the material is not only timeless but almost oracular, turning present day into nothing more than an amplified, funnier/sadder version of where we were at a decade ago, although come to think about it, that may just be a coincidence.

this is another gem of a stand up show from eddie izzard . you cannot fail to laugh at the wide range of topics he talks about. he even takes the piss out of his american audiance at times and most of them didnt even realise it! a must see for anybody who likes comedians. 9 out of 10.

this is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows i've ever seen. i laughed so hard, i'm sure i missed half the jokes. this showcases izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is. what i particularly like is that he seems never to be "dumbing down" the material for his audience. his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags. thumbs way up.

this video rocked! eddie is one of the funniest comics i have ever seen. not only does he have class, he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that i have ever seen. eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic i've seen in a very long time. tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this "executive" reign!

i'd heard of eddie izzard, but had never seen him in action. i knew he was a transvestite, and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer, i put it on, not knowing how my husband would react. well, he blew us away. he's better than robin williams ever was. he has total control of the audience; when he does the 'englebert is dead - no he's not', routine, the audience doesn't know what to think by the end. god as james mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england - 'cake or death?' is priceless. my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show. we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again, and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on. if you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and tape it, you won't be disappointed.

stumbling upon this hbo special late one night, i was absolutely taken by this attractive british "executive transvestite." i have never laughed so hard over european history or any of the other completely worthwhile point eddie izzard made. i laughed so much that i woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house...

in my opinion, this is the best stand-up show i have ever seen. i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill, but i must say i think this is his best work. i would say, though, if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live. it is worth it!most of the time after seeing a stand-up routine a couple times, the jokes start to get old. but i have to say, i've seen this show so many times that i literally have the entire thing memorized (which yes, i realize is kinda sad) but every joke still makes me laugh. this is truly a feel good show.dress to kill will never get old for me. i own it and watch it anytime i need a good laugh.

witty. funny. intelligent. awesome. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a wildfire started. i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know. a few. like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn't think it was as awesome as i did. the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don't walk. watch this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it's a win-win situation. i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of....sanechaos.

this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen. eddie izzard is a genius, he picks in brits, americans and everyone in between. his style is completely natural and completely hilarious. i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a** off. watch, enjoy, it's funny.

i find myself comparing all stand-up acts to this one performance now. even older recorded performances i once thought were funny just don't seem as funny after seeing eddie izzard in this award-winning look at history, language disparities, and englebert humperdink...

i had no idea that mr. izzard was so damn funny, it really boggles the mind that he is not more well known! his command over the crowd and his timing is perfect.the monologue about star wars will kill ya too! if only all the stand up performers had his wit...

i love eddie izzard. i think this is awesome, and the other television specials should be looked at as well. he has a good book "dress to kill" out to buy as well, which i think people should read. i loved that this program won an emmy, and anyone who likes history will probably get a laugh from eddie. enjoy :)

so i'm at home, flipping channels one night, and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on hbo. naturally, i did a double-take and decided i'd watch for a little while. i didn't change the channel until he was finished, it was so incredibly hilarious. the next time it was on, i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again, and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch. during the first couple of minutes, you can tell that the audience isn't quite sure what to think, but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit. while many stand-up comedians mesh together in my brain, eddie izzard stands out as one of the best. his style is incredibly refreshing, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events. his show stayed with me afterwards. i went to italy over the summer, and all i could think about while i was there was how "italians are always on scooters going 'ciao...'" 10 out of 10. see it. you won't regret it.

eddie izzard is a one-in-a-million comic genius. he goes from squirrels to wwii to stonehenge to religion to englebert humperdink and it's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense! get a copy of this now, you won't regret it! i give this an 11 out of 10.

the drug years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of tv documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on tv. it's actually not long enough, in a way. all of the major bases in the decades are covered, and they're all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides. but it almost doesn't cover enough, or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time. for example, the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs (partly the marijuana, later cocaine) is really well presented, but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover.overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs, pop-culture, government intervention, the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia, all felt the wave of various drugs over the years, and the interplay between all was very evident. nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot)- goes to endorse drugs outright, but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun, and then tragic, about taking certain drugs. the appearances of various staunch, ridiculously anti-drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and america's connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees. the only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not 'just say no', because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought. it is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them (as, for example, oxycontin continues on in the marketplace).is it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary? no, but for some summertime tv viewing for the young (i.e. my age) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago, as well as for the 'old' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks, careless times, and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it. there are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased, which is not totally untrue, but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social, political, and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving (for better or obvious worse) for enough of a fascinating view.

if you lived through the 60s, this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous. it's all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time. these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out: "don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin, for the times they are a-changin'". while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and it's dissemination at the time, that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia, influencing engineers, scientists and aiding in the hyper-development of computer related activities. a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there - you've captured the era better than i've seen before.

i just saw the drugs years on vh1 and i love it. i think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the all generations. there is woodstock, there are joplin's, hendrix's and jim morrison's deaths, there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse. it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad ways. in my opinion this documentary is well done and i would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these days. i am waiting for the dvd release. you should definitely see it!!! this movie is stunning-- big time!

i personally watched this to see the footage of the 60's and 70's. it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life. the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous. you feel like you're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time...because it feels so good and familiar. i loved it, all segments from 60's-present day. i highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, the hipper movement, politics and good 'ol history. i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler, only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards, since i discussed what's in all 4 segments, so just wanted to be safe.

i have had the pleasure of reading martin torgoff's book "can't find my way home" which is chock full of info on the drug culture of america, spanning the years 1945-2000. this guy knows his stuff!! i found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. i particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. the soundtrack was excellent. whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era. hopefully they will package them and sell them as a cd set. i would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with lsd forever changed american culture as we know it. one thing that was missing was any mention of george jung (played by johnny depp in the movie "blow"), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's.

i would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that martin torgoff is my uncle and i am so darn proud of him. this mini-series that in shown on vh1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it. the amount of time and effort that i have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all (can't find my way home) makes it that much better to watch him on tv. i know that he loves what he does and he does it well. his eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he did himself, and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary. from the music to the videos and everything in between, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it. i appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it (or didn't) and would love to hear from fans! three cheers for uncle martin!!!

i've been watching this every night on vh1 this past week. this is a terrific revealing portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's.woodstock,easy rider,the beatles,the death of morrison, hendrix, joplin are all here. vh1 has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the "drug years". from the sanfrancisco bay area to studio 54 this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and new life it breathed into the american culture.from marijuana to lsd to cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs effected the arts (music , movies etc.) featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage.drug films: the trip easy rider up in smoke reefer madness blow boogie nights

shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i've seen all year. it's about a prison program, somewhere in california if i recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. the film follows their production of "the tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally; i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime. it's like some loopy episode of oz, and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.

shakespeare behind bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content. convicts at luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange, kentucky who have raped, murdered etc and surrounded by bad people in an obviously depressing environment find something they genuinely enjoy and can become important, popular and celebrated in acting. there are paralleled themes to 'shawshank redemption' with their institutionalised natures and search for forgives and redemption for their past lives. as we follow a generous, non judgemental director, who gives up his time each year to direct certain inmates in a chosen play by william shakespeare (this time around, the 'tempest', that was cleverly portrayed with the inmates who could relate to it so much with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption in which they confide and relate to) we are introduced to each actor in formal interviews that are nicely paced with break up footage of them rehearsing. each actor has their own story and tell of their regrets and reasons why they are there in emotional fashion with melancholic music over each in a traditional documentary sense. the strongest and most respected inmate (it would seem) is sammie. the director appears to immediately realise who the most interesting inmates were in sammie (and later, hal) and allows a longer, more in depth observation into the man and his personality. his presence is felt on screen and his personal revelations come as a shock to the audience, but give him such appeal in his emotional personality and a particular empathy is felt toward him. hal is the same at the beginning of the film. he has other things that he does to pass the time that's shown as a comfortable hobby as it were in running an on site news broadcast programme. again, through personal interviews and revelations self admitted by hal (and nicely shot cutaways of hal's body language, not the close-ups of his uncertain hand movement not only observed with him but others as well,) in particular his heart felt story about being unsure and scared of his true sexuality in a society that purely would not accept him as a homosexual until later on in the film where he is shown to be quite snide and rude to other inmates involved in the play as though he deems himself above all of them, in particular to ron who already has a frustrating temperament in his acting. the relationship between all of the inmates involved in the play is shown as one of respect and unity to achieve something great for themselves. with nice (if not clichéd) motions of time passing by with titles etc everything seems to go right in the first act, and then on the build up to the public performance, things predictably go wrong. an induction of one of the actors being transferred and his character being replaced by a younger, newer inmate gives the narrative a nice subplot into someone who promises big, but in the end disappoints all and does not live up to their expectation. one inmate in particular (big-g) welcomes the new inmate actor (rick) with an evident will to nurture him into their beloved practise and hopefully become a good role model. the film seems to capture each inmates passion so well with something the audience can relate to especially when rick is put in the 'hole' for getting new tattoos (something nicely hinted upon earlier in the film when the warden stops a random inmate in the yard and asks him when he got a tattoo that's on his arm and we learn it's a punishable offence in the facility) and big-g's disappointment is understood deeply. a happy ending? it all looks great when they are performing successfully (even being invited to perform elsewhere) and a sense of real unity echoes around them, but in the end, the film brings everyone back down to earth that this is short lived and everything they ever had or wanted was and will always be taken away from them. it is back to prison to pay for their crimes and no matter what redemption they seek in acting these plays, they won't be free men, their proud performances and recognition is undermined by the fact that they are the lowest of the low criminals and a nice halt in the uplifting music that plays in a shot of a long corridor that coincides with the lights turning off and doors shutting is a powerful image of their oppression. the director seemed to be aware he was watching likable people in the documentary by given additional information at the end of the film into each actors future from the end of the film about where they are and what's happening to them now.

if you're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright william shakespeare? and if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes, you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals. in a kentucky correctional prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results. this film shows how it was all done.the casting.the rehearsals.the set and costumesand the final presentation of shakespeare's play "the tempest." it had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison. in the play the ship-wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world. prison life too is much like that.with a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape, the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience, may be not quite as shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure.more interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character. one inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins. it was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder, shooting and strangulation. one had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. however (as someone said) the past was past, and the present was the beginning of a new future. at least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events.the prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place. such an event would put kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example. it seems to me that everyone stands to benefitnot only the kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole.

one of the best parts of sundance is seeing movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss. unless you're a real art-house devotee, you probably don't catch many documentaries. only a handful get any recognizable distribution. fortunately, sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years.shakespeare behind bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange, kentucky. every year a group of inmates present a shakespearean play. director hank rogerson and his crew follow the troupe as roles are self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed and ultimately performed.the movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us that have not been exposed to prison environments. despite the labels we know them by (convict, felon, murderer, etc.) we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking feeling human beings. serendipitously, the play chosen for the year of filming was the tempest, with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption. the actors all grapple with the relevance of the play to their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama.for a documentary film, like a book, the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives. shakespeare behind bars was a personal revelation for me. "o brave new world, that has such creatures in it."

my father was the warden of the prison (he is retired now) showcased in this documentary and i've grown up around the prison life, so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie. i will say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. they were brave enough to a) show up and tell this story, b) get inside these inmates minds and hearts, and c) do all of this responsibly. responsible to their art and, more importantly, responsible to the inmates and staff of luther luckett correctional complex. they should be commended without end for this work. to take 170 hours, yes hours, of footage and be able to cut and whittle it down to 93 riveting minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect.i saw this film under circumstances that only a very, very few were able to see it. i was at the inmate screening. i was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on screen. i saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you, it was a very profound experience. these men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases, yet have found ways to try to redeem themselves, even if they view themselves as unredeemable. how many of us have the courage to do this? how many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment? to see them react to the film was an experience i am eternally grateful for, and i will never forget that. i thank the men who allowed me this glimpse into their lives, i thank my father for making all of this possible, and i thank philomath films for taking the time to pour their blood, sweat, soul, and tears into this project.this movie will change everything you think you know about prison life, and the inmates held within it. 'oz' is not real, television is not real. 'shakespeare behind bars' is.

i showed this to my 6th grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. i loved it, too. the story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. the cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well. the battle between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic footage.alan root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the best documentary oscar. the copy i have doesn't have orson welles narrating it (derek jacobi) and it isn't called the "mysterious castles of clay," just "castles of clay." this makes me think that it must have been done with welles added for star power and an oscar push.i was lucky enough to find this vhs just recently and it is now my children's favorite movie. they brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a disney movie. if you can find this movie you are indeed lucky.

i agree whole-heartedly with the comments so far. i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative i've ever seen. as stated before, i recall that i began watching, thinking it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but i was so wrong. not only was the story of the colony incredible, but i remember the music as being so much a part of it's appeal. if i remember correctly, it was native americn pipes (akin to the music at the end of one flew over the cookoo's nest). i, too have been looking for a copy. this should be required watching for anybody, but especially the schools. it should be re-released.

twenty five years ago, i showed this film in some children's classes in entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids; they were spellbound! it is not just about the termites who have built and live in the "castles of clay," but also about the other animals who use the mounds. there is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch. it is a not only good for entomology classes, but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds. i wish it was available on dvd, so that i could watch it again and show others.

of all the football films i have watched, this is one of the 2 best. the other being fever pitch. but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, diego maradona. this story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.the musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. the narration by michael caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic. this story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself.exciting games like france v brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. the final argentin v w germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. a classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a maradona fan.

diego armando maradona had been sixteen years of age in 1978 when argentina won the world cup at home. he was already the biggest star, and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football. everybody had begged cesar luis menotti to play the boy genius, but the manager thought that he was not yet ready.history records that argentina won the 1978 world cup fairly convincingly - they hadn't really needed maradona. the same was not true in 1982. spain was a catalogue of disaster for argentina. menotti - still chain smoking - played diego this time, but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy. maradona had signed for barcelona on june 4 1982 for around $7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the camp nou and belgium beat argentina one-nil. it was not an auspicious debut, and even though he scored twice against hungary in the next match, maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir - a crude, petulant foul on brazil's batista in the second round that abruptly ended his tournament and argentina's reign as world champions.but now that was all behind him. maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at barca, and left in 1984 to join napoli. it was as if he was finally home. the neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice maradona to poor, underachieving napoli. gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the camorra's millions as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to make him feel at home. so, for the time being at least, maradona was el rey - he brought his argentine side to mexico as one of the favourites, and with a new manager - carlos bilardo replacing menotti.maradona is the hero of this story, a one-man world cup winning machine. in 1982, hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the falkland isles; now the british press yearned for a rematch (with the same result) in mexico city. maradona was still regarded with distinction in england, remembered more for a superb performance in britain during a 1980 tour than for spain. but he was still an argie: the enemy.england actually started well, and lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes. a key event happened on 8 minutes. fenwick, the big and limited english defender, was booked - he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area.after a tense first 45 minutes, the second half started with a bang. maradona danced forward after 50 minutes, but could find no way through. similarly valdano's attempt hit only white shirts. then the moment of infamy that serves as diego's epitaph. hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area, shilton hurriedly jumped to claim - but there was maradona, somehow rising above the english goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net. how had he done it? simple: handball.the most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion. every spectator waited for mr al-sharif of syria to blow for the foul (he didn't). shilton looked and appealed to the linesman - he ran back to the centre circle. unless he assassinates the pope, or becomes the first man to step foot on mars, when the great man dies this moment will be shown first - in long, lingering, slow motion, followed by the look of glee on his face. the next image will be his next gift to the world - the world cup's finest goal.burruchaga stroked the ball to maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half. he span, and accelerated away from beardsley and reid. this was the real diego - he burst through butcher and attacked fenwick. fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack. normally, he would have aimed his boot somewhere near maradona's thigh - sure he would have picked up a red card, but who cares? then fenwick had a brainwave - he hesitated, and decided to run at maradona waving his arms - perhaps he was trying to put him off? diego shot into the box as fenwick fell over. butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement. shilton charged out in panic, and maradona twisted around him and prepared to score. now butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the argentinean - instead he gave extra impetus to the shot, which smashed into the goal. england were coming home.during this magical mexican summer, the world had found a successor for pele. in fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed - pele had been superb in 1958 and 1970, but had had great players all around him. maradona did not. 1986 was his world cup.

this movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. what strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. besides following the play like a tv broadcast, there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games. this brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory. today's tv broadcasting style, so different than that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.the players are not the only stars. the audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history. in this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. in that regard, today's tv broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before.there are several highlighted players: maradona (argentina), elkjaer and laudrup (denmark), francescoli (uruguay), platini (france), lineker (england), rummenigge (germany), butrague#o (spain), socrates (brazil), and sanchez (mexico).this movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. across all the movie, there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves. this is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.because of what happened because of referees during mexico 1986, much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely maradona-biased. much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen, that they are as human as the players, and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other. soccer rules do not allow referees to use tv based replays to make decisions, so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive. as a consequence, referees play an active part in the development of a game. their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie.the sequel movie for the 1990 world cup, compared to this one, is just a source of bitter disappointment. much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game, whereas this movie tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.

diego armando maradona was, and still remains as the best football player, the game has offered. not just an athlete, but an artist. this documetary if the 1986 world cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world. because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal, which he scored against my own country(england). there's absolutely no point of diminishing this star. although i dont undersand spanish, i can appreciate the argentine narrator. he actually cries of happiness, and can barely express his emotion..... anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend, but readers.....you have to watch this to know what i mean.

this is a great movie, it shows what our government will to to other countries if we don't like their government. this isn't as bad as what reagan and bush number one did to south america, but the us still has no business messing around with other countries like this. this movies also proves that american media spouts government propaganda. this is exactly what they did to aristide in haiti. the reason this coup against chavez didn't succeed is chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote.this movie isn't just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie if it were a drama, it's amazing that this is real.the other reviewer is lying when he says "chavez seizes the airwaves", the private media is running anti chavez propaganda all the time.

to me this was more a wake up call, and realization that most all we see, hear, read and think about most anything, is dependent on what the media feeds us. this is a classic example of high level spin doctors attempting to control the masses through controlled information. it is also an excellent example of how people that have a constitution that they freely bought in to, will not be swayed by this media control or any attempted mis-information. once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of the many will in fact outweigh the needs of the few. it is also enlightening to see that in in a country where there is no religious civil war going on, that democracy is not a real hard thing to implement.

this is an astounding film. as well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust chavez, we are given the background picture which describes a class-divided society. many of the rich, it appears, have a choice with the people's democratic choice, and are willing to use the military for regime change. 'be careful what you say in front of your servants' is a revealing comment. the head of the country's biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president, with us backing, and these young irish film makers have it all on camera. a great film to educate young people about democracy. we see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated, and force used, in the interests of big business, against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people. riveting stuff.

i very much enjoyed "the revolution will not be televised". it gave me, once again, a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed.it is unfortunate that in venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. however, when their coup failed; after the interim government dissolved the supreme court, and the constitution, and the ombudsman, and the electoral boards, and all civil rights, no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them. they haven't even gone to jail. the major plotters are living in florida, carrying on. and the protection that they had was the "bolivarian constitution" passed by a large majority of the venezuelan people. it is not only history that bites. democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose. and in venezuela it is loose.

this movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from april 10, 2002 through april 14, 2002 in the venezuelan presidential palace, caracas venezuela.the pathos of the movie is real and one feels the pain, sorrow and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup d'etat of president hugo chavez.one comes away from viewing this film that hugo chavez is truly a great historical figure. hugo chavez's persona single-handedly brought the venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day old military-installed junta and re-establish the democratically installed government of venezuela.it is obvious from the film footage that george w bush aided and abetted the venezuelan coup d'etat. that the mainstream media aided and abetted george w bush is not surprising.what is surprising is how few people has seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of america's mass media.it has taken only 20 years for ronald reagan elimination of the fairness doctrine in 1986 to turn america into blind and rudderless state.may hugo chavez open patriotic americans' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true american vision.

one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries, you'll ever watch. while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas, it provides an intimate look into political dynamics, that prevail throughout the western hemisphere. while essentially another chapter in the story of the "u.s. backed, latin american coup", this film chronicles in real-time, what can happen when the poorest people, are armed with unity, political savvy, and courage! the political insights offered by this film are invaluable. one gets clear examples of the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of "american politics". one gets a clear sense of impending doom, if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. we also see the arrogance and fascism, of the cia backed, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring venezuela back under washington's domination. though ably led by president hugo chavez, the people of caracas are forced to act without him, after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. their response is the highpoint of the film. if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the u.s. government, hugo chavez, and revolutionary venezuela, are all about, this movie is it!

yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. it's so interesting to see how a world leader (like chavez) who supports the poor people in his country, can be held in such low esteem in the us. his worst "sin", in my opinion, is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel. what can be so bad about that? i have always been fascinated by the us government+media reaction to fidel castro. at first, castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted batista. soon, however, castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. we're a decent country, but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? if these guys are "dictators," then we could use more "dictatorships" especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.

you've never seen anything like it. once the coup begins, it's the most dazzling, edge-of-your-seat thriller you'll ever see -- even though you know the outcome. and it's all real, because it's a documentary -- amazing. by the time it was over, it was on my top 10 list of all time great movies.disregard the slobbering right-wing fanatics. everyone i know who has seen this film gives it the 4-star rating. even if you don't care about politics or about venezuelan politics, you will find yourself nerve-racked and -- believe it -- on the edge of your seat.it's a roller-coaster ride.

a case of being in the right place at the right time. what a fascinating film. it is easy to see why chavez is so popular with his people. he gets things done. he is accessible. and it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much. he has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people. mostly the poor. and it easy to see how the tv stations can portray misleading images to put there case. just like the iraq war, or the war on terror. or those missing wmd's. or how about the axis of evil. people need to wake up. and get different points of view. stop the neo cons ruling the world. go watch this movie with an open mind. and make your own mind up. then i suggest you see aaron russo's: america: freedom to fascism. it is not the people of america that are the problem. it is the government.

very good point there : "only an elite few (the upper classes) would both have access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively english speaking site such as the imdb" some might think internet is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake: you are probably right.. even if there is internet cafe's in venezuela most chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on imdb.screw you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors .. probably this is your first time using internet ;)..

this really is an incredible film. not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty, subterfuge, and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before.and in the cross hairs we see the usa, once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality. it's heart-breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. these irish film makers deserve our gratitude. long live chavez.we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit. first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary does a great job of doing just that.

even though we know how the story ends, this is a gripping fly-on-the-wall film that plays almost like a political thriller. during the calm before the storm, we meet hugo chavez as a charismatic, larger than life man who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos who make up 80% of the population but have previously been shut out of venezuela's political process and its oil wealth. he seems as devoted to them as they are to him. he travels the country at a hectic pace, reaching out to the campesinos, addressing huge crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, accepting letters on scraps of paper, and hearing pleas for help. the people are excited that one of their number has made it to the highest office in the land. there is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the festering barrios.but not everyone is happy with the situation. the pure-blood castillian spaniard elite who are a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth are full of bitterness and resentment. one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is when an ann coulter lookalike, at a residents' meeting in an exclusive gated community, complains of the mestizos, "they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice." minutes later, a speaker tells the meeting to "beware of your domestic servants - they could be chavez supporters." duh! of course they are.in a late night interview alone with the film crew, chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather. he can be a sensitive, poetic person, though with an impish, even clownish, sense of humor (like we saw when he addressed the un and called bush the devil.)then the storm starts to gather force as the coup organizers call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters into changing the route at the last minute and marching on the presidential palace, knowing it is surrounded by chavez supporters and violence is inevitable.another element of the plot falls into place as snipers on rooftops begin to fire on the chavez supporters, some of whom fire back. the local equivalent of fox news shows this return fire and claims that chavez supporters are massacring protesters. then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! the protesters took a different route. needless to say the footage of the empty street was edited out by the rabidly anti-chavez private tv stations (who had been airing a constant barrage of propaganda calling chavez mentally ill and sexually fixated on fidel castro.) immediately after the coup, we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly bragging on tv about how they had manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike.the filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic, fast-changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. chavez eventually surrenders to avoid bloodshed but refuses to resign and is whisked away to an offshore island where a plane awaits to take him - where? the us? how can the remaining cabinet members avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who are closely linked to the bush administration? watch the movie and find out!if your only knowledge of hugo chavez and venezuela is from the us media, then you know nothing. he is not an "unelected tyrant" and does not "rule by decree" - he is enormously popular, having been elected and re-elected several times with over 60% of the vote (something george bush junior has never achieved) and the devotion he inspires in ordinary venezuelan people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails.this is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. the skill of the filmmakers is in being unobtrusive and letting the story unfold through the voices of venezuelans at every level from the barrio to the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and confusion out of which a coherent whole emerges that is tense, riveting and moving. not to be missed!

i've been impressed with chavez's stance against globalisation for sometime now, but it wasn't until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved. this film tells the story of coup/conspiracy by venezuela's elite, the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments, to remove democratically elected president chavez, and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship. this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson to the rest of world ! i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands, and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime.

it's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official "truth" and caught so many "news" agencies with their pants down. this movie, in my view, deserves every price there is in journalism - it's objective (yes!), courageous and a real "scoop". it can do without comment, fake scenes or leading questions - everyone, including chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words. the filmmakers "only" had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.the venezuelan elite teaches us "how to depose of a president and sell it as a victory of democracy". it's amazing that they lost in the end - so far. from what i know, the biggest tv station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked, they're still broadcasting via cable and satellite. i highly doubt whether george w. or barack obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup. but then, they don't have to worry.the fact that the "chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians" scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called "free" (established) media really has become, or has always been, only more so. an important lesson to anyone interested in what "really" goes on in the world.the famous "objectivity" challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view, or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse "us" - it has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb, the us secret history of spreading "democracy" around the world or the iraq war that, according to johns hopkins, has killed 1,3 million iraquis by now, not to mention the 60,000 afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. to be objective, saddam hussein was less damaging to his people than the us. and the us is ready & willing to be more damaging to the iranians that he was.i'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some khmer rouge leaders before the international tribunal in the hague, whether there will be any mention of "our" involvement in supporting and training pol pot's guerrillas in the 80's, when they had been largely defeated by the vietnamese. probably not.all the more reason to turn to the independent media for balance, if not exposure of fraud.

with part reconstruction and part direct shooting, the directors made a formidably limpid documentary on a coup d'état against president chavez in venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the wealthy venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the church (a cynical laughing cardinal) and the us government. it was another chapter in the history of us foreign policy, which steven kinzer calls 'overthrow' or 'sowing democracy american style'. in fact, this foreign backed intervention was not only a coup d'état against president chavez, but also against the democratic majority which elected him. that this is a brilliant documentary is mightily confirmed by the violent reactions for and against it on internet. as saint augustine said: 'men love truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it proves them wrong.'this movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.

one of the best documentaries released in recent years. some points...1. hugo chavez was elected venezuela's president in 1998, his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela.2. in 2002, a coup briefly deposed chavez. at the time, irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were in caracas, shooting a documentary about chavez for british television. their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath, and electrifyingly records history unfolding on-the-spot, outside and inside the presidential palace.3. chavez aimed to free venezuela from the free-market policies imposed on it by the us. though venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace.4. despite being the world's fourth largest oil supplier, venezuela remains swamped by poverty, its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations.5. the documentary begins by portraying chavez's first years as president before the coup. it focuses on his popularity with the poor, and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals (educational plans, distribution of the oil revenue, grass-root democracy etc).6. chavez was a huge proponent of education, and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it.7. when chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. this, understandably, made the oil companies nervous.8. a media-war broke out. the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the state-run tv station. they questioned chavez's motives, sanity and sexual orientation.9. without media support, the coup would not have been successful. the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated.10. under the guise of "re-establishing democracy", the opposition silenced the state-run tv station, dissolved the national electoral board, supreme court, national assembly and took control of the military.11. moneyed interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the us and cia), organised a citizens' march on the presidential palace to effect the coup. snipers shot at chávez supporters, but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted.12. police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters, further bloodying the streets.13. chavez, held captive, refused to resign. of course the media/government then lied, saying he had resigned, but chavez's cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community, which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv.14. the people rose up, pressuring the return of the president they had elected, whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace.8.9/10 - at a little over an hour long, this doc is far too short. nevertheless, its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of "media warfare" which rarely gets touched upon. makes a great companion piece to "the battle of algiers".worth one viewing.

someone has already mentioned "being at the right time at the right place" it was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not. it is all real. the story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries. it sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many believe,led by the us) uses agents who attack "any" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups. a marine officer in the film mentions this also. that they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets. all of these scenarios have been played in turkey(usa's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a pro-government religious/conservative media opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc.what makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events have happened. it is clear that the directors are pro chavez. whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, i would not know.and whether chavez will be defending the people of venezuela against the dictatorship of us and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell.but at least chavez is hope and i believe it is worth taking the chance.

a remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself (for further evidence, check out some of the comments on imdb...!). compares extremely favourably with oliver stone's "comandante" (which is mainly an in-depth examination of fidel castro's nostril hairs). i don't know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being, or yet another in the long line of populist latin-american "caudillos". nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans. it's hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but i've certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what's at stake, and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup. someone says in the film "we're making history", and that's exactly what the film feels like it's capturing. outstanding stuff.

this documentary has been aired on both rte and bbc in the last number of months. having seen it twice now i would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary film making.initially this documentary was meant to detail the political life of venezuelan president hugo chavez. the irish crew set off with those intentions. what happens when they get to venezuela is startling as they witness first hand the attempted overthrow by rebel factions (particularly the oil concerns in venezuela) of chavez and his government. what we the audience witness is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect backs the overthrow of chavez by distorting events that transpire as the coup heightens.it really is an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers.

i had no idea of the facts this film presents. as i remember this situation i accepted the information presented then in the media: a confused happening around a dubious personality: mr. chavez. the film is a revelation of many realities, i wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made. i supposed the protagonist was mr.chavez but everyone coming up on picturewas important and at the end the reality of that entelechy: the people, was overwhelming. thank you kim bartley and donnacha o´briain.

this documentary (now available free on video.google.com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. everyone must see this.chavez was elected in a landslide vote in 1998. his platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from the 20% middle class to the 80% poor. he banned foreign drift net fishing in venezuelan waters. he sent 10,000 cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free. he wiped out illiteracy and set up new free universities. but it was his 30% tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the bush administration. in 2002, while irish film makers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were interviewing chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs, a cia backed coup was launched. with the cameras rolling, chavez was captured and flown out of the country. it was announced on national tv that he had 'resigned'.but the poor of venezuela didn't believe the media. they went to the palace in their millions and demanded that chavez be returned. in the face of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the us. chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation.

ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration. this documentary provides the viewers with unique footage about the 2003 coup in venezuela. this great film is now the minimum knowledge requirement if you want to express a competent opinion about venezuela or hugo chavez.the dramatic, electrified atmosphere, the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment. you'll feel like you're in the middle of the situation. the film will help you gain unique insight in the happenings of 2003 and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on tv. it's something you shouldn't miss.

whether this movie is propaganda or not (i firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of media. the importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man chavez is. it is really to demonstrate the way the bolivarians saw how it happened, the chavez way of seeing it. although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film , i think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate. the venezuelian people via the private media corporation of venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup, the neo-liberal side. this movie shows us the way the bolivarians saw it . call it propaganda , i say it's a judgment call on your part.

the material in this documentary is so powerful that it brought me to tears. yes, tears i tell you. this popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights, put forth the greater good of the community and stop making up cowardly excuses for not challenging the establishment. chavez represents the weak and misfortunate in the same way bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok. indeed, latin america is being reshaped and the marginalized majority is finally having a voice in over five centuries. though, in the case of mexico, the election was clearly stolen by calderon. chavez is not perfect, far from it. he's trying to change the constitution to allow him to rule indefinitely. that cannot be tolerated. enough with the politics and back to the movie; the pace is breath taking at moments, and deeply philosophical at others. it portrays chavez as a popular hero unafraid to challenge the us hegemony and domination of the world's resources. if you think the author is biased in favour of chavez, nothing's stopping you from doing your homework. one crucial message of the film is questioning info sources, as was clearly demonstrated by the snippers casualties being shamefully blamed on chavez's supporters. venezuela puts american alleged democracy to shame. hasta la revolucion siempre!

i just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporation's 'passionate eye' series. it has been screened recently (sept. 2003) at the toronto international film festival as well as many others. it is a quite remarkable film. the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about chavez himself. instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. they had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. they, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. as a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, i think, the way it should be. what we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.

this is something new.there's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it.a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc. without repercussion from the governments side (like, say, silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). oh, and they still claim that they are being suppressed, of course.see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get?? ).and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands, and reinstall their elected government.this sounds like a hollywood fairytale, but it happened for real, against the explicit wishes of the usa. the documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot from the center of the action, acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup: the good, democratic, freedom loving, benevolent usa (who still channel large amounts of money to chavez' political opponents).also highly entertaining and exciting. 10 points.

i can not quite understand why any of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0" other than for political reasons. no, the film did not investigate both "sides" of the story, but then surely one film in favour of chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the narrative overall (especially given a. the history of cia involvement in latin america in fermenting civil unrest - google national security archive and b. the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly faked scenes of chavez supporters shooting non-existent opponents). what is most amazing about this film is the fact that the film makers stayed in the presidential palace all of the way though the coup - surely a first in documentary making - images of a coup from both sides!!!

the entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very non-threatening and non-medical way that even preteen children can easily understand. it dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946) while sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is. this is also, purportedly, the first hollywood production to ever use the word "vagina" in the dialogue.it is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day. many of the betty boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either. max fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the betty boop cartoons which required frame-by-frame viewing to find them.there is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is. in fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning kotex and kimberly-clark corporation.this title is nearly impossible to attain; but for those who are bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether. this is one of those "keepers" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity.

although this film is somewhat sanitized (because it was made at a time when people just didn't talk about sex), it is an extremely helpful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. not surprisingly, it was paid for by the kotex company, though what may surprise many is that disney made this film--as they made a lot of educational films during the 1940s-60s. however well made the film is, though, i think the film maker's missed a real opportunity. instead of the nice female narrator's voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they'd used minnie mouse and the rest of the disney gang!! i know this would have given old walt a heart attack, but wow that would have been a great film! by the way, although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film, it does adequately explain menstruation in general. however, it does lack some details (especially about intercourse) that i assume were included in the accompanying booklet.now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about menstruation.

when i saw this as a child, it answered all of my questions and dispelled any fears or misconceptions that i had. it is easy to watch because it is animated, which makes it unthreatening. it has no moral bias or "preachy" aspects, so nobody should have any objections to it. it is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring, "matter-of-fact" way. i hope to show it to my daughter.

if you have not heard of this film from walt disney pictures, do not worry about it. it would be classed along the other films by disney that are meant for educational purposes like "family planning".it was co-produced with kotex to teach pre-teen girls about menstruation, supposably. it only educates at a superficial level, so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated "ram's head"/ reproductive system sequence.the film does show "the wonderful world of disney" elements like the turning of the page and the use of animation to tell the story.this film is impossible to find, so if you can find the film, best luck to you and enjoy.

super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. the imax camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix (if only that would appear on dvd!). i enjoy watching it again and again.the only minus, and why i didn't give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up. the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges.

sure, for it's super imagery and awesome sound, it's a great home theater "show off" disk, but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. the parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. young, old, boys and girls alike will find that deep down, we are all fans of the automobile, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. the mark knopfler and ry cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content. i don't want to give away the ending, but the final driving sequence to quincy jones' "days like these" just might bring a tear to your eye. enjoy it!

this is a well-made documentary on the exciting world of indy car racing. the photography is simply outstanding. the scene were mario andretti drives the old racing roadster down the new england street lined with the ancient maples, leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car, is incredible. the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film.

this is an excellent documentary, packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story. the imax cameras give you a very wide perspective, as a dvd movie it is perfect. your hear every speaker working almost all the time, the film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph. of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good, they give a depth to the driving scenes...

this is a great documentary film. any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film. director "stephen low" did a great job,as well as the main stars of the film, father & son, mario & michael andretti. the dvd looks & sounds amazing. and best of all it's imax! great home theater test disc.

i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. the musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production. even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system.the subject is also so fascinating. it is about mario andretti and his son michael. i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship, f1 championship, the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500. the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son. the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection. the other car is michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season. imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating.paul newman, who was michael amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made, narrates the film. his anecdotes and witticism, drawn from many years as an owner and driver, lends much to the production.the main feature is the race scenes. turn up the volume here! there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget. wow!the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family. this god of the racing world, mario andretti, is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career. they work together so well that every father and son should see this. you can tell that they are a close family. i wish we could all have that experience.

i may be getting ahead of myself here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, i watched it piece-by-piece on tcm last night, the question arises to me: why did they do that? putting their lives in jeopardy, many of them died on the trek, why would they undertake such a life-endangering journey, just to find food for their animals (!) once they reached the "land of milk and honey", why didn't they just stay there? would you endanger your life, and that of your entire community, just to find food for a herd of cattle? as dangerous as it was, to do it for that purpose alone, shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people. risk death for a cow?? better them than i!

this documentary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing. i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel. i think i will see if i can order a copy of it on dvd. the film footage doesn't look all blurry and choppy like you might think from 1925 b & w silent film. set in iran in 1925, the nomadic tribe people in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river, men, women, children, animals... then up and over a snowy mountain pass all barefoot. it is sink or swim and climb or die. in search of grass for their animals. they have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. in one scene a man is carrying a mule who is too sick to climb the mountain. the children in the documentary all look happy and healthy. they had such a hard life. i wonder if the nomadic tribes of iran still live like this. makes you appreciate modern life in usa.

they probably could have skipped some of the beginning - i'm not sure why this starts out in the asian part of turkey. if it was because starting in the mediterranean, they could have gotten closer starting in modern day lebanon.one the cameras and crews get to the bakhtyari tribe, it's the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle, and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving karun river. they use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs were removed. the other "bank" of the river was very steep - i'm guessing about a 60 degree rise.just watching that was incredible, but there was much more to come. to get to the pastures, they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself, but they (and all of the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! yes, barefoot.the one drawback to this documentary were some of the inter-titles with poor attempts at humor.if you want to see a documentary from the silent era, or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only face, but conquer. this is just an incredible document of a little known group of people facing all kinds of challenges.

i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage. it was made in 1925!!!! i think it absolutely incredible for it's time! the journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable. it took them a week just to cross a river. the women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. i would like to see anybody do that now! i thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story.

this was soul-provoking! i am an iranian, and living in th 21st century, i didn't know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather!you see that today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on-demand, but here 80 years ago, people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass. it's really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep, but they lose many the sheep on their way.i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as tough as bakhtiari people.

fantastic documentary of 1924. this early 20th century geography of today's iraq was powerful. watch this and tell me if cecil b. demille didn't take notes before making his the ten commandments. merian c. cooper, the photographer, later created cinerama, an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film. fans of werner herzog will find this film to be a treasure, with heartbreaking tales of struggle, complimented by the land around them, never has the human capacity to endure been so evident. the fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects, but of the filmmakers themselves.

this was incredible, meaning that it was hard to believe, that the "forgotten tribe" would make this astounding migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, cooper and schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. but what shots they are! the cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness.i had the pleasure of seeing this and "kon tiki" on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.

the first collaboration between schoedsack & cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the bakhtiari tribe of persia. twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to pasture. you'll feel like a pampered weakling after watching these people herd their animals through ice cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to get their animals to walk along steep and narrow mountain paths.

the team of merian cooper and ernest schoedsack produced a documentary of 50,000 bakhtiari people and their animals on the summer migration to winter grazing. the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the "roaring twenties." a more drastic contrast could not be imagined. raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die. to make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end. the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film. having said all this, the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening's entertainment. the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple re-takes. the western inter-titles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day. off-duty entertainment by desert police becomes a "policeman's ball." the producers went on to make the docu-drama chang (1927) and the totally commercial king kong (1933). the migration theme is used again in people of the wind (1976) and in himalaya (1999). recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into -- and then highly recommended for them.

despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced. presented in digestible (as digestible as war can be) episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time. eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u.s. the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year.

this is a fantastic series first and foremost. it is very well done and very interesting. as a huge wwii buff, i had learned a lot before seeing this series. one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver. i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr. overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike.

this was by far the best war documentary ever made. from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in oradour-sur-glane 'the day the soldiers came'. to the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over japan, i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in 1974. each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. this whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that bigotry, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.

i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it. i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered. this is just how a doco should be, unbiased and factual. the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic. the only other series that i have found equal to this is 'die deutschen panzer'.i only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series, then they might make some great war movies.note. band of brothers, saving private ryan, letters from iwo jima, flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some i'd recommend

i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again, on dvd, over thirty years later. the pictures over the opening credits have never left me. it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it. my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we always discussed the programme afterwards. it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our school's public exams!sir laurence olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect. i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war. i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it. maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated, although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imagine.buy it!

this excellent series, narrated by laurence olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the end of world war 2. the origins are not entirely examined fully from germany's fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a 26-part series with so much to cram in. apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a world war 2 buff/fan. episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, britain, germany, japan, russia and the u.s.a. were quite eye-opening. showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. i'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (of which it could be said i am one at 47!).certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with frank whittle's experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor's combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262 - especially as the v-1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2. this is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more barren old science. but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated. a series to own as a box set in history terms, on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud.

i remember watching this in the 1970s - then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library.with a nearly 30 year hiatus, i have come to another conclusion. most of the principals interviewed in this series - some at the center of power like traudl junge (hitler's secretary),karl doenitz (head of germany's navy) anthony eden (uk) - are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on.from generals and admirals to sergeants, russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, all are on record here. i can remember the lord mountbatten interview (killed in the 1970s) this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work - well deserved.seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set.this is the only "10" i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with a little time...

the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2. the 24 episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it. the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power, and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world. they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war, and the holocaust. one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. all of you must watch this. perfection! 10/10

as so many others have written, this is a wonderful documentary. here is a list of the 'chapters' for anyone interested: 1: a new germany: 1933-1939 2: distant war, september 1939-may 1940 3: france falls, may-june 1940 4: alone, may 1940-may 1941 5: barbarossa, june-december 1941 6: banzai, japan, 1931-1942 7: on our way, usa, 1939-1942 8: desert north africa, 1940-1943 9: stalingrad, june 1942-february 1943 10: wolfpack 11: red star the soviet union, 1941-1943 12: whirlwind bombing germany, september 1939 13: tough old gut 14: its a lovely day, tomorrow: burma, 15: home fires: britain 1940-1941 16: inside the reich: germany, 1940-1944 17: morning: june - august 1944 18: occupation holland, 1940-1944 19: pincers: august 1944- march 1945 20: genocide: 1941-1945 21: nemesis, germany: february-may 1945 22: japan: 1941-1945 23: pacific: february 1942-july 1945 24: the bomb: february-september 1945 25: reckoning

this is what we can do to each other. this is the sort that everbody should see at least once.it does not glorify world. it shows that it is the everyday person who is killed, mained and debased by war. the person on the "other side" eats sleeps, laughs and cry just as we do.

war is hell. but this documentary of wwii is heaven.not only is this series a breath-taking, almost-exhaustive look at the second world war, it's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier.this documentary series defines the genre. it's sweepingly long, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more. (i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year).truly, this is an impeccable bit of film-making. other than olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories; whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper.i'm going to go watch it right now (again, my... 11th time).

i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s.i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it.it became a weekly ritual every sunday, and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special.the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document.so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each.some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic.while the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itself.this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead.the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time.anthony eden the foreign secretary,carl donnitz,head of the u-boats,albert speer,pet architect confident and later armament minister for hitler.in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge, hitler's secretary,who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament-she left the bunker after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines.these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed.if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code-breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers.the opening titles and music are magnificent,and lawrence olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script.the best documentary series ever made? without doubt.unmissable

still the definitive program about the second world war, the world at war isn't just long, but also very informative. the series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. most episodes are about the war in europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific. other episodes include information about the wars in africa, burma, the atlantic and the home fronts of germany, great britain, united states and soviet union. there is one episode that's dedicated to the holocaust. the series starts off with the episode a new germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. the series ends with the episode remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. each episode is like a mini-film. the footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. in addition, some of the footage is in color. the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining.the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television (uk). commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. the series was narrated by laurence olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them albert speer, karl donitz, jimmy stewart, bill mauldin, curtis lemay, lord mountbatten, alger hiss, toshikazu kase, arthur harris, charles sweeney, paul tibbets, traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose. jeremy isaacs says in "the making of the world at war" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to isaacs, was heinrich himmler's adjutant, karl wolff. the latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in himmler's presence.the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war. some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. in a list of the 100 greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, the world at war ranked 19th. the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. i've seen some of them several times. there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer. one is called the great war (1964) that's about world war i. the other is called cold war (1998) that's about the cold war obviously.

world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time. the historical research is virtually flawless. even after a quarter century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2. an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war. i highly recommend it as a learning experience.

i am not a very good writer, so i'll keep this short. world at war is the best wwii documentary that i've seen. i've seen different wwii documentaries (not only english/north american) and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i've seen. i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why/how hitler got to power, but it does a very good job at covering the war. it seems to be complete and objective/fair to everyone. it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations. it has a lot of original footage, including color footage and many eye witnesses (it was made in 70's when a lot more were alive). it has great music and narrator. all-in-all i gave this one 10/10, because it's that good. (i haven't seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those)

i remember watching this as a child in the uk, mesmerized by the story and laurence olivier's narration. we would talk about nothing else at school the next day. i imagine the ratings for the first showing were huge. this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much. what is interesting is that the battles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely unrecognized as such by americans. the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american generals, the suffering of german troops on the eastern front, the maltreatment of japanese prisoners of war by american troops. the images of the holocaust made me, a non-jewish european, feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people. i don't know why this is not number one in the imdb rankings. perhaps they are showing their bias against documentaries. spoiler - we win.

this is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of world war 2 from the invasion of poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945.honest and to the point, this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war. at the same time tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked, much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high, low and turning points in the allies fortunes. being a british produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on britain, but russia and america's contribution are not skimmed over this is but one such advantage of a series of such length.another worthy mention is the score, the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil, struggle and perseverance. like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the germans during the war, its build to a climax at the end of every episode, which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war. after watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation.

10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must see, with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years, untill this was screened in 1974. the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. the whole series is over 20 episodes long, and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still, and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch. you must watch this at some time, even if it's a few episodes, even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war, in a world at war..

example of how a world war 2 documentary should be made,using first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful conflict,and archived footage gathered from around the time .i caught this on a re-run on the history channel about a year and a half back,with no knowledge really of the second world war at the time,but it enveloped me,and now i consider myself a world war 2 buff,watching and reading any and all that i can find about it,but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary,definitely worth buying the boxed set of.............this is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard.

i must have seen this a dozen times over the years. i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b & w on the local pbs station.i bought a dvd set for the children to see, and am making them watch it. they don't teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. it expands their critical thinking.impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.buy it for your children, along with alistair cooke's america. watch it with them, and make them understand. you'll be so glad you did.

this should be required viewing for all young people. this is documentary at its best, from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses, the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanity's sorry experience at the nadir of the 20th century.

after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making. the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project. it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian(ken burns ?) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original. if you are interested in this era don't miss this series. it is required viewing.

certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison. the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation. no one country is given undue credit for the allied victory. laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator.

if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives, this dvd delivers, you will learn new things guaranteed, so much so that you won't need any other documentary's on the subject. get this, watch it, learn from it. good for school use as well. as a bonus, watch this with tora tora tora, saving private ryan, patton, band of brothers, a bridge too far, the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete. sir laurence oliver's voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26 part series. seriously you won't find a better wwii documentary set on the subject. perfect 10!!!

although too young to remember the first showing of the series (being just a baby) i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's, just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects. it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific. since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era, with mixed opinions. the british television stations are generally very good at producing these, as the world at war can easily attest, with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies. i strongly recommend such titles as "the nazis - a warning from history", "blitz" and the bbc series about dunkirk. "britain at war in colour", with its companion series "japan", "germany" and "america" are of a very high standard. the world at war is by far the best and, despite its age, never fails to deliver. there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other, even if such an undertaking was even possible. what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable. that certainly worked for me: i now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, dvds and tapes and cds. recommend to anyone with even a passing interest. the series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative.

the music and laurence olivier's sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary. this is still a must see for ww ii buffs, descendants of the participants of that conflict, politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier (did you hear that george bush?) and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict. the 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained. there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented. actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories. many of the interviews are with second line authorities, that is, support personnel to the main characters, privates, captains, secretaries, eyewitnesses and the like. you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about.i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary. i strongly recommend this over the worn out, gaptoothed, overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay. i paid $120 cdn for five 2-sided dvd discs. this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode. the menus are easy to follow, there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode. it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years, nay, after 60 years since the war finished.i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy. now my wish has finally come true.see this documentary. tell your friends. buy a copy for your library. remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america, russia, britain, canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory. what an eye opener.

my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times. i can't imagine how it could be better. this isn't the "complete" history of wwiino library could hold such a historybut it is the best summary of that history. lots of detail, lots of personal stories, and still keeps the overall picture in view.olivier's narration is excellently written and, of course, superbly given. the interviews are from all sides, except the russian, because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians. it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd. we treasure our copy.the producer's do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive: there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles, for instance, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done.

theo robertson has commented that waw didn't adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitler's rise and wwii.perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8? covers this period, and together with the earlier volumes in the series, shows clearly the existing conditions, i feel. a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period, joined the hitler youth even, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in waw.this documentary is so far above the history channel's documentaries i also own, that there is no comparison.the only fault, and it is a small one, that i have with waw is this: the numbers are not included, many times. for instance, if you're talking about lend-lease, then how much war material was lent/leased? how much to russia, how much to britian? how many merchant ships did the u-boats sink, and when? how many ships did the german or japanese navy have, total, in 1941? what type were they? how many troops? how many troops did the allies have, in total, and by country? lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off, but i would have preferred more! and naturally, i always want to see more military analysis. like why didn't patton & clark trap the german army that was at cassini, after they had it surrounded, instead of racing monty to rome, and letting it escape? i don't think you can begin to understand war until you've seen some of these video segments on "total war", like the fire bombing of dresden. it's like trying to understand auschwitz, etc., before you see the clips of the death camps: you just can't wrap your head around it - it's too unbelievable.unknown at that time, and of course, unfilmed, were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese, including cannibalism, (read "flyboys"), and some live vivisection of medical "experimentation" prisoners, w/o any anesthetic! dave

utterly brilliant. powerful and evocative. the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war. it's tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits. rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war, it allows sir laurence olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocents. most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of "civility" are removed. there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on. perhaps there could be a follow up series called "the century at war" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this.

this series, produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second world war, is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual's presumption to criticize.the timing of world at war's production in 1974, amounting to some three decades after the events of the war, permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant. the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did.the information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact. such names as ira eaker, adolph galland, louis mountbatten, albert speer, gertrude junge (hitler's personal secretary)... the list is far too long to relate. today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to ww2. the dvd series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price.i am almost done watching the 11 disk set, having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than 10 years ago. it has lost none of its poignancy to me, indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times.the highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation. i think the value of this series is beyond counting.

the documentary begins with setting the perspective to several light years. the voyager is traveling our milky-way with the sounds of our earthly lives, as a space monument for (possible?) extraterrestrials. the documentary contains footage of willy dixen, robert johnson, skip james and j.b. lenoir. the footage of j.b. has never been published before. the narrative is from 'blind willie' dixon. however, it's done by an actor. the film shows the work of all these early blues men followed by covers and interpretations by musicians, such as nick cave and the bad seeds among others. the death of j.b. lenoir (john mayall's song) is a striking event in the story. lenoir got political engaged and is considered to be of the league of martin luther king and peers. his political interests can be found in the themes of his lyrics. blues is found to be 'the' native music of america. blues is the roots and the rest is the fruits.the title 'soul of a man' is after a willie dixon song.

i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival.i absolutely was into it. i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes. it is amazing set-design. the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies.and the music is so nice.i rate this experience 9/10.* spoilers ahead *the documentary tells about awesome blues-men, with black-and-white old-looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. it is really amazing. but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary. it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those blues songs in a modern way. i didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs. this is the same kind of un-perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club.the documentary was such a standing-ovation at this first screening in the little cinema, that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open-air cinema. though the sand, the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night.

i have not seen this movie, but i must. having read all three of thor heyerdahl's books (kon tiki, ra and aku aku) i am actively looking for a copy of this movie.the thesis that peruvians migrated to polynesia is alive and well. considering that this crew had no gps, and only an old fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6-watt output, their voyage was heroic to say the least.please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video.i would be interested in buying it.

i have watched this film twice now and think its quite good for the limited equipment used to create this film. (filmed in 1947) dr. heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of south american pre-colubian indians to the polynesia's islands by way raft fell of large balsa trees. this documentary follows dr. heyerdahl and crew as they select balsa trees in equidor and float with them down river to the pacific for assembly in peru. they launch off on a 101 day sea adventure testing the strength of their primitive raft surviving only by means available to natives of that era. see for yourself, a real adventure!

the tweedy professor-types thought they had it all figured out. today's peoples who inhabit polynesia descended from migratory asians, intrepidly moving from the far east, island to island, eastward into tahiti and all the other exotic tropic isles of the south pacific over thousands of years. but the established thinking just didn't sit well with young norwegian ethnographer thor heyerdahl. if that explanation were true, how come some folks born and bred in those islands have traditions, artwork, and physical features resembling not those from asia, but south america? how can the vegetation of ecuador, peru and chile look so much like what you'd find on the island several thousand miles away? is it just a coincidence that the islanders point out to sea in the direction of south america and say that is where their ancestors came from, led by tiki, their equivalent of adam? meanwhile, how is it norwegians speak of scandanavian forerunners who were chased from the south american continent they had colonized, and, together with some of the native peoples they befriended, set off over the sea -- heading west? it's all too much to be a coincidence to heyerdahl. with an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of crewmen, and the local know-how for traditional raft-building, an expedition begins. it's as much a trip into the human imagination as it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible with only the very basics of tools and seamanship. the oscar-winning documentary may be dated in its tone and anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it soars with a spirit of adventure besting even the space program that launched a decade later, as men are willing to risk it all to test a theory they think is true. wonderful. do yourself a favor and read the book first. it is an amazing page-turner and the perfect setup for the newsreel-style movie.

i happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it, and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean. thor heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient incas in peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to polynesia, based on certain relics that are found in both places, certain types of ancient sea-going vessels that we know they had available, analysis of ocean and wind currents, and the knowledge that the incas did, in fact, travel in some undetermined amount at sea.in order to test his hypothesis, heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient incas had available, using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time, and set out from lima, peru's capital, to try to reach the islands of polynesia, some 5,000 miles away.his theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right. the film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100+ day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced. i often wish that academy award winning documentaries were easier to find, and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as i am sure it was when it was first released.

of course, he did have to invent everything about cinematography, film directing, etc. before he could make classics like "the gardner," so i suppose he may be forgiven this initial excursion into mere sociological documentary. today we call them "home movies," and they are just as boring now as this one is

the first film ever made. workers streaming from a factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right or left. along with melies, the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. the truth. there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former.but consider this short again. there is nothing 'objective' about it. the film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene burst into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured, decentred from the back to right or left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). and yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it.worse is the historical reality of the film. these factory workers are lumiere employees. the bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions. the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace. the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. a frightening, all too prophetic movie.

how can't you rate this movie with 10/10? i admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history! this is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le prince de galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving! and above all the shot is a beautiful shot! and it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that! what a moment! historic for science first (because the lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. a movie to venerate!

what can i say about the first film ever?you can't rate this, because it's not supposed to be entertaining. but if you have to rate it, you should give it a 10. it is stunning to see moving images from the year 1895. this was one of the most important movies in history. i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever!

it's utterly pointless to rate this film. it's as if you would condemn (or praise) the newly born for his future life. instead look at it as a powerful meditation at what could have been and what has been in the past 100+years. one hundred and eight years of the cinematograpy: what has become of the babe? i like to contemplate on what would have (creatively) happen if europe wasn't interrupted (devastated) twice by the great wars of the xxth century. on her ruins the bogus neon castle of the non-creative and reactionary circus named hollywood erected itself. before 1914 french, italian and scandinavian cinemas were leading the way both financially and of course creatively. french film in particular was already threading some very original and creative pathways that could have (if not interrupted) possibly altered the medium history in some unimaginable ways. one wonders what the film history would look like today if it wasn't stultified and choked by the mercantile and cheap political agenda of the hollywood's 80+ years of, what chekhov might define as the reek of greed and harlotry... be it as it might, please at least become aware of la sortie as the key (or at least one of them) to the "kingdom". thus the birthplace of cinema : lumiere brothers factory, lyon, france the date: march 19th 1895 (there's also a replica reel shoot in the summer of 1895 so if you notice summer lights and the workers' lighter clothing: that was the version shown to the very first people who ever saw the moving images. *louis lumiere: creative ideas, cinematography, direction it was all louis' own domain because auguste took care of the rest (money). *first film reels were all fifty seconds long: the camera(=le cinematograph) & the cameramen (le cinematographer) having only paltry fifty seconds to make things happen! *apparently le institute lumiere has managed to preserve around 1500 of these first films executed mostly by an industrious brigade of loumiere travelling cinematographers criss-crossing the globe. ***so, all the stars in starry heavens and a minute of silence for perhaps the most magical invention in human history (so far).

story says that on that on december 28, 1895, a small group of thirty-three people was gathered at paris's salon indien du grand café to witness the cinématographe, a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named august and louis lumière. the small audience reunited that day (some by invitation, most due to curiosity) didn't really know what to expect from the show, and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen, most thought that the cinématographe was just another fancy devise to present slide-show projections. until the photograph started to move. what those thirty-three people experienced in awe that cold day of december was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen; history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day.of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day, "la sortie des usines lumière" (literally "exiting the lumière factory") was the very first to be screened. the film shows the many workers of the lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory, leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work. while a very basic "actuality film" (movie depicting a real event), the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise, as their concept of moving pictures was limited to edison's "peep show" machines (the kinetoscope), the brothers' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe, as the people and the horses moved across the screen. the idea wasn't entirely new (le prince shot the first movie as early as 1888), but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary."la sortie des usines lumière" would become the first in the long series of "actuality films" that the lumière would produce over the years. this primitive form of documentary was the brothers' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the cinématographe could have. despite the initial lack of enthusiasm, after the first showing the cinématographe became a great success and "la sortie des usines lumière" quickly became an iconic image of that first screening. it definitely wasn't the first movie the brothers shot that year, and it probably wasn't the best of the 10 movies shown that day (personally i think that "l' arroseur arrosé" was the best of the 10); however, it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates, as literally, this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it. 8/10

the appeal of ancient films like this one is that you get to see an actual moving image of life over 100 years ago. here are a lot of people leaving a factory, all of them dead by now and none of them even remotely aware of the magnitude of the invention that they are walking before. i was shocked to read one reviewer call this film as boring as home videos today, and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first film ever made (it was the first film made at the rate of 16 frames per second, rather than the then-normal 46 frames per second). sure, all you see is a lot of people filing out of a building and passing before the cinematograph on their way home from work, but this is a curiosity piece for dozens of reasons, not the least of which is that it was the first film made by the lumiére brothers, who probably had a stronger impact on the development of the cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history.

you're using the imdb.you've given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films.it's something you enjoy doing.and it's all because of this. fifty seconds. one world ends, another begins.how can it not be given a ten? i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight... exactly how could the first film ever made be better? for the record, the long, still opening shot is great showmanship, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to the situation. and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch. all this within fifty seconds.the word genius is often overused.this is genius.

this one-minute film is arguably the first movie ever made. other inventors had previously filmed actions - like edison's motion photography of a sneeze - but the lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium. at the time, of course, their `cinematograph' must have bewildered their peers, including their subjects. in this first instance, the brothers record employees leaving their factory, some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera. the lumieres attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle, but `la sortie des usines lumiere' doesn't nearly match the ingenuity of their later films. the most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers' selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject. their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world's people, a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today.rating: 8

on the 28th of december, 1895, in the grand café in paris, film history was writing itself while louis lumière showed his short films, all single shots, to a paying audience. 'la sortie des usines lumière' was the first film to be played and i wish i was there, not only to see the film, but also the reactions of the audience.we start with closed doors of the lumière factory. apparently, since the image seems a photograph, people thought they were just going to see a slide show, not something they were hoping for. but then the doors open and people are streaming out, heading home. first a lot of women, then some men, and one man on a bike with a big dog. when they are all out the doors close again.whether this is the first film or not (some say 'l'arrivée d'un train à la ciotat' was the first film lumière recorded), it is an impressive piece of early cinema. being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons. one simple reason: it is only fifty seconds long. but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here; you don't get to see historical things like this every day.

all films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place.in 1894, the lumiere-family men [father: antoine (1840-1911), sons: auguste and louis] owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper. not a small enterprise; the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits - innovative for that time. it was located at montplaisir in the suburbs of lyon, france. what caused louis lumiere to become interested in building a cinematagraph, in 1894, remains open for speculation. my suggestion is that the appearance of the edison organization's kinetoscope (peep-show machine), in paris during the fall of 1894, provided the catalyst.w.k.l. dickson, of edison's staff, invented a motion-picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in february 1893. it was electrically operated (using power from from heavy storage batteries. this massive machine pumped celluloid film strip (newly developed by the eastman company) past a lens at about 40 frames-per-second (fps). it was ensconced, as an almost immovable object, in the "black maria" (essentially the first movie studio.) the kinetescope machines showed staged presentations (less than one-minute long)that were filmed in this studio.during 1894, louis lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving-picture camera. he had determined that, even at 16 fps on celluloid film, the persistence-of-vision of the human eye/brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived. his camera, dubbed the cinematograph, was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps.the size and light weight, of the camera (it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source) made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event (provided there was enough sunlight available.) in the spring of 1895, louis filmed: trick-riding by some cavalry men; a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water; and a number of other scenes in and around lyon. using a molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the revue generales des science. the images were projected on a screen five-meters distant from the lens. the screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms. at a meeting of professional photographers, that same year, louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival.with accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities, louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. since each of his films would be about one-minute long, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. for one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory, photographing the egress of employees at quitting-time.the public venue chosen by antoine - who offered himself as the "fairground barker" for the cinematograph - was the salon indien of the grand cafe on the boulevard des capucines in paris. it was a wintry saturday night on 28 december, 1895. as the first audience sat, they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the lumiere factory (with closed gates.) some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of lumiere photographs. but then the crank on the camera/projector was turned and movement began. louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking. this film has a beginning, a middle and an end. in the beginning, the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace; during the middle, the people stream out - with many trying to ignore the camera, and the cameraman, as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them. at the end, the gates to the factory are being closed.and this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public.

this documentary was very thorough and exposing, and at the same time entertaining, which i thought was rather impressive. i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its' origin until present day, but nonetheless, there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film...i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the 'proper nouns' of the sport, so to speak: too much on individual locations at which to surf, and especially too much on individual surfers. i felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc. it would have been better (although this of course was covered, i do not think it got as much time as it warranted). and for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing, at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring. although the video clips and the in-depth research is well-respected, it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers.furthermore, my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding, and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing, breath-taking event that these men are talking about as life-changing moments, and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it, and not the actual footage. it was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories, and then be unable to see them. i understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything, but please: do not brag an event up so much, and then not show it. overall, a very fresh documentary that i enjoyed watching; not the best documentary due to the above reasons, but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that i would advise everybody to check out.

i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now. i must really love it, right? well, not really.i was a surfer earlier in my life, and i loved the sport. to this day, i am fascinated by good surfing. riding giants has plenty of that, and thus i am a sucker for the thing. but i definitely have some bones to pick with it. (peralta, you listening?).first, the movie has too little faith in its subject matter. the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined. very, very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish. peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic, cut-and-pace method. it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot mavericks in northern california. not a single wave is ridden start to finish. almost the entire section on mavericks (one third of the movie) is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack. i can understand the effect peralta was trying to achieve with mavericks, as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop, but he goes way too far. mavericks is not just a bad acid trip. waves are actually ridden there, even with great performances. it would have been good to see some of them. if peralta thinks this is a grand sport (and i am sure he does), then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much? at times, the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable. there is one fast clip in the section on peahi in hawaii, which i still cannot understand. even if i run it on slow motion on dvd, the image is too fast to be decipherable. it must be a couple of frames in length at the max.second, have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement? it is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors' version on dvd. these guys sound like two over-the-top valley girls. the same sentiment shows up in the main production. every thing is always so goddamn "amazing" etc. one character in particular is just plain obnoxious -- sam george, the editor of surfer magazine, who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say. he is a super drag on the movie.there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie. i mean, just to get the old movie shots they have, and also, all of the interviews. the movie is a great story, and i think it is generally captivating entertainment. thematically it is well laid out, with the three parts centering around greg noll, jeff clark, and laird hamilton respectively. there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal. in the directors' narration, they say it is a new type of 3d technology, and it really works. the three principle characters shine, both in their interviews and in the water. as an athlete, laird hamilton is a revelation. he rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball. and too, the story of his meeting his father is a gem. it really touched me.it is just that the movie could have been so much more. the very last part of the movie, when the credits roll, gives a hint of what it could have been. there are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack. (the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish, though you may like it if you are fan of the modern, frenetic school of rock.) anyway there's my two cents...

i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. it is filled with super-surfer greg noll's home movies, and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. nevertheless, it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. it is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or ph.d's(again, perhaps). it believes in the quest of the surfer. it believes in the beauty of human goofiness. it believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before. it celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the russian socialists. surfing is the ultimate narcissism. it is dangerous, but only slightly historical. i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. this movie has no military heroes. it has no guns. the only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. this is not a problem. peace is not desperate. it is the joy of exhalation.

riding giantsthis documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer films, dana brown's endless summer, its follow-up endless summer ii by bruce brown, dana's son, and step into liquid (imax). i saw the first, not the others. while the surfing footage is spectacular, i valued most the film-maker's historic perspective. he takes us back to the sport's origins almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it evolved to its present form. this includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs changed over time, which beaches in hawaii and california were most frequented by the world-class surfers, and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them. the athletes lived for months at a time on beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary bunks, fished for food, and went back out on their boards the next day. what a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. we see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. what was the biggest boost to the sport? believe it or not, it was the movie gidget, although i suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the beachboys' surfing songs like surfer girl and surfing usa. the surfing magazine and encyclopedia of surfing (who knew there was such a tome) are mentioned for their contributions. we also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport, their families, and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s. one such story is how 40-year old laird hamilton, considered today's greatest surfer, bonded with an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his single mom, who he married before becoming his step-dad. a rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. have i whetted your appetite? wonderful. have a great ride.

if it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport--no, the pure lifestyle--of surfing to its perfect form, this documentary has done it. this documentary shows the life isn't just about the waves, but it's more about the people, the pioneers, and the modern day vanguard that are pushing the envelope of big wave further than it's ever been.stacy peralta--a virtual legend from my early '80s skateboarding days as a socal teen--has edited reams of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence and created what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. when his heart and soul is in the subject matter--and clearly it is here--his genius is fraught with a pure vision that doesn't glamorize, hype, or sentimentalize his subject. he reveres surfers and the surfing/beach lifestyle, but doesn't whitewash it either. there is a gritty reality to the sport as well.there is so much that could be said about this documentary, about the surfers, the early history of the sport, and the wild big wave surfers it profiles. greg noll, the first big wave personality who arguably pioneered the sport; jeff carter, an amazing guy who rode virtually alone for 15 years on northern california's extremely dangerous maverick's big surf; and, the centerpiece of the documentary, laird hamliton, big wave surfing's present day messiah.there is tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys--and a few girls who show up on camera--and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that comes through in every word. i found the story of how hamilton's adopted father met him and how hamilton as a small 4- or 5-year old boy practically forced him to be his dad especially heartwarming (and, again, stripped of syrupy sentimentality).if you like surfing--or even if you don't--this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched, if only because you're a student of the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly well-done works of art.

everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great), the personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture through time). what is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance: chucking mainstream american culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.i was a surfer in the 1970s. we used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in socal. i remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, putting on a hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night. often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script off sheets of paper. sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. i was never happier. except for the hooting and hollering, seeing 'riding giants' took me back in time.it also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge, not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder, not keeping up with the joneses, pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question, "what is the purpose of life?" at least for those like greg noll, laird hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: to live life solely on our own terms. maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.it was this message that really impressed me.

riding giants is an amazing movie. it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf. their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. they didn't care about money, jobs, girls or any thing. to them the waves were their girls. i have never been on a surf board, and it looks so hard, i don't understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie. if you're a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came into life, who is really famous at it or what ever, then you should really see it. it might be a documentary, but it is really good. -tara f.-

as a popular sport, surfing was liked by many people. just after watched the documentary, i realized how dangerous it could be. in fact the surfers also scared of big waves. even somebody got killed by it. but they still kept on surfing and enjoyed themselves. only brave people can do it.according to what the surfers said, we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came at them. you have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave. when you win it, that will obviously bring you huge satisfaction.the amazing cinematography cannot be overlooked. that is absolutely visual enjoyment.an excellent sports documentary. 8/10

noll's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments, often with expletives, to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing. there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues, using more language than necessary. this guy should never have been given a thesaurus. cut to noll and you know you're in for a treat!the way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a "lost era". nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less took care of issues like medical care. the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done.

again stacy peralta is true first to the people who lived the story. by letting those involved in the genesis of big wave surfing tell us their stories, how it felt and what they thought, you get the feeling of having been there. the film carries you from the fifties to the near present by focusing on three primary architects contributing to the evolution and development of the sport. candid "home movie" like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world. the layers of music, culture, technical information,a pure view of the participant's athleticism, and fabulous big wave images you get a full scope perspective of this aspect of surfing.thoroughly worth watching.

i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title. this movie is not primarily about the act of "riding giants," but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, riding giants, to change the emphasis.in my teens i lived a block from the wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. i've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. the idea that jeff clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding maverick's by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp. the first safety rule of any water sport is "never surf/dive/swim by yourself." he went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it. i wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left. in the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body. these are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (i can hardly type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon, i'm blown away. there is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world. this a great film. i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the hamilton/kalama crew, and i think they deserved mention. splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is!

i stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked. the story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves, waves that are monstrously huge, waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves. there is nothing special about the film, other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk. sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people. here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching. half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well. few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film. see it.

if you have seen dogtown and z-boys or have any interest in seeing the real, non-caricature, "real american" side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before.this film is "unreal", a facile term if ever there was one, but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of an opera, and the completely apparent sense of love, expert and knowing instilled by stacy peralta's direction and narration, this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.this film is a symphony, crafted as well as beethovens 9th, beginning beautifully with its prelude in hawaii, tugging deeply on human emotion in santa cruz and finishing with uproar, triumph and crescendo in laird hamiltons feats, again in hawaii.like classical music; like beethoven's 9th, ride of the valkyries or barbers adagio for strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. trust me.

i used to write comments at imdb, but i don't do so anymore. it happens that imdb has become massive, and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores. what do i mean? that anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject, watches some crap (or the opposite), and in case he likes it, delivers a 10, and if he doesn't he goes for a 1. this of course, cannot measure anything correctly. now for the film. i truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films, because then i must score this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. this documentary has something that i don't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film. it is simply mesmerizing, and it's not just a way of saying; it really is. the last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys-, that really... there's no possible match. i don't keep movies, rarely would i find any sense in doing so, but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by. i got nothing more to say. this is a genuine, objective 10 for me.

i rate this 10 out of 10. why?* it offers insight into something i barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; i have never surfed, but i love surfing movies, and have seen many. none taught me what this movie did * the movie was very well edited. it flowed well. the interviews were outstanding * it's interesting from start to finishin summary, it's about as good as a documentary as i have seen, so i have to rate in terms of that. so 10/10

this was the best documentary i've ever seen!! i just saw lords of dogtown and wanted to know more about stacy peralta, and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well. great job stacy! i was kicking back at work last week, bored o*&^%less and this movie came on. growing up in orange county in the 80's i surfed up and down the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager. i grew up at the beach, my parents took me every weekend, i body surfed, boogeyboarded then moved up from there. this movie just captivated me. it was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys went through..true pioneers! this movie is a collectors item.

there's been a spate of recent surfing movies that i seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning. i caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! the focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60's greg noll to our current laird hamilton, from waimea bay to mavericks to jaws. hell, i could watch a movie just about laird hamilton - one of this generation's great athletes - so the rest is just gravy. there's loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars, in pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious fashion. of all the surfing movies i've seen this tells the big-wave story the best, and i think it's my favorite. enjoy!

riding giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big-wave surfers, gregg noll, jeff clark, and laird hamilton. stacy peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job. the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration, interviews, animation and surfing footage. the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film, making riding giants brilliant viewing. personal highlights include any of greg noll's comments, what with his straight-to-the-point frankness, laird hamilton's footage at teahupoo, and the out-takes at the end of the movie. but really this entire film is one big, recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. it's a shame it isn't more well known, but it is a gem deserving of attention. 10/10

wow! stacy peralta has followed up dogtown and z-boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big-wave surfing culture in america. piecing together insider archival footage along with interviews from surfing legends, we are transported into the daring and free-spirited life of the early pioneers whose sheer passion for the sport spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millions.it's getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth. you can feel the respect peralta has for this group as we hear accounts of greg noll striding from a pack of awestruck fellow surfers on the beach to singularly challenge 50-foot swells off hawaii's north coast. or jeff clark, surfing the outrageously dangerous maverick off the northern california coast all alone for 15 years before it was discovered and became the surfing destination in california. and the storybook history of laird hamilton, today's surfing icon. hearing greg noll reverently refer to hamilton as the best surfer ever sent chills up my spine.(as an aside, noll, clark and others were at the sundance screenings. noll humbly described himself as an old, over-the-hill surfer. he was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film. both he and clark were as likable in person as they were in the film.)riding giants pays homage to these extraordinary athletes while at the same time rewarding us with an insight into the magnitude and terrifying power of the waves they seek to conquer, the gut-wrenching vertical drops required to get into them, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience each time they take on a monster swell.all this, and the movie has more. for those of us that didn't live in california in the 60's, we get an insight into the impact of surfing on american pop culture. (and, to my surprise, the impact of the movie gidget on surfing!) peralta also weaves in a primer on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment. i'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the sundance audience, i was absolutely captivated by this film. peralta is staking his claim as the big kahuna of american documentaries.

riding giants is a brilliant documentary that dives deep into the world of one of the most under-appreciated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only director stacy peralta could capture. everything from the structure, to the players, to the amazing stock footage, to even the style in which this was filmed only reinforced the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing. of all the surfing films that i have seen (endless summer, billabong odyssey, and step into liquid) this was the most consistent and relevant. beginning with the early ages of surfing (a brief history lesson) lasting all the way till laird's infamous ride, riding giants goes further into the mind, heart, and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries. how does it do this? by giving us the whole story, from start to finish, without fictionalizing or jig jagging from wave to wave.to begin this film was structurally sound. in the other films that i have seen about surfing, you sometimes find yourself jumping from new person to new person, wave to wave, event to event, without any knowledge of why or who? in riding giants, we have a very small cast of veterans and newbies. this allows you to really go deeper into the mind of each one. also, instead of just riding waves, we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before. this is what really attracted me to this film. i was impressed that instead of showing all these big waves (because it is a big wave movie), we listen to stories and see first hand what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves. i loved the information about the "beach bums" or father's of surfing. i am still floored by the amazing tales of greg noll and his early adventures into the harsh deep blue. then, to see him in person, talking about what was going on in his mind, only added more fuel to the fire. the straightforward structure that peralta followed allowed me to follow and walk away with more knowledge of the sport than with any of the earlier films. peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you cannot help but be amazed by what these brave people have done, and where the sport is going.add to a immaculate structure some intense and creative cinematography, and you have darn near perfect film. using techniques that i last saw in the kid stays in the picture, riding giants creates some scenes that almost feel as if they are jumping out of the screen. while it isn't 3d, it is that flat dimensional feeling that you get when you put two pictures on top of each other. in this film, it worked. it created more depth to the scenes, and really added to not just the shock value (man these waves were huge), but also the danger that these guys constantly faced. if it broke differently or they maneuvered wrong, these waves would kill them. some did die, but it didn't stop the sport. it only created more excitement and more passion to do better. it is this love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my final point.the human element. so many of my earlier adventures in the world of surfing documentaries left me with beautiful waves, but very little about the people. the films knew that people were watching for the waves, so it would basically go from wave to wave to wave and the maybe a short second about the person. this film was the direct opposite. peralta created this masterpiece by still giving us the waves, but devoting so much more attention onto the surfers and the immortal question of why they do this everyday. what rushes through their minds, what pushes them to go further, and the bonds that are formed while out there on the wild blue yonder. i felt like after watching this film that i not only knew more about big wave surfing, but also about the emotional side to the sport. this was an element not as developed in the other films and pushed riding giants to a whole new personal level.overall, this film was brilliant. never have i witnessed so much passion, devotion, and love wrapped in a structurally sound film. from beginning to end, i was impressed. i would be very happy if this film won the oscar this year for best documentary, and to see a new rebirth in the surfing world and open more doors for films of this nature.grade: ***** out of *****

if you're researching ufo facts, then this video is very important. the 'meat' of the video is the comments made by buzz aldrin. he is without a doubt from the best of america. trained to be objective, honest and factual in his reports. many astronauts from america of all eras have reported some kind of contact, or ufo observance and there are videos from some of those missions. at the very least something has happened that requires further objective ongoing investigating. i think this testimony from buzz aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress. like all supposed documentary video, this one may be slanted, but it does contain further information and opinions from an accomplished american hero. those don't come along every day. so the fact that some people aren't interested in details should not detour your from viewing this video. if nothing else, it is interesting and i recommend you watch with an open mind.

putting the ufo "thing" aside. this was the best documentary i've seen. factual reporting by neil and buzz... a must see. the interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and only released in 2006. no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes... the facts will blow you away, and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon... neil and buzz are probably the biggest hero's of our time. ever see a man save his own life? bet not. neil saves his life when only mili-seconds separated him from death. amazing to watch. it is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death, from a failing computer... 10 stars!

gruveyman2 (comment below)you are a complete idiot...blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to. its that whiny arrogance, that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about sf, that makes you seem like such the typical la a**hole! the only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about sf is because you are jealous. of course you don't know it because you are so la jaded. first of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city; what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals. it says nothing bad about la; and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over la. they recognize that they went to film school in la and are obviously proud of that fact. they recognize that sf is close to la which is a benefit. the only negative thing that was said that relates to la, was about the studio executives. the same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them, but then those same movies went on to be huge world-wide grossing films. so why wouldn't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system? these are the only people they are trying to "disassociate from" and for good reasons! don't be so sensitive! how can you say that francis ford coppola is the "so called" san francisco director? how is he not to be considered that? and who directed the godfather? coppola did. it was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award. so what who gave him the job? he admits it in the documentary that he didn't even want to do the movie....so what's your point? and so what if sophia wants to live in la? and that proves your point how? and tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies. movies that are now considered classics. and, when they made movies from studio funding, one, it was la that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two, they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own. they said exactly that in the film."your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film."how the hell can "bitchy-ness" and "self-congratulation" suddenly have an "air" of self respect and credence....if they never go to la again? what a stupid and senseless comment! you inserted some big words in there....and just don't know how to use them! and, by the way, they never claimed nor implied they were superior to la! so what if they are giving a guy from new york an award in la....again what the hell is your point? so if they go to la or new york they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in sf? you make no sense.san francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today. this film just focused on one aspect...film-making. for you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city (not the movie! but the city and its people) only proves what it is we northern californians hate about people from la! this is a great documentary...very interesting, especially if you are from the bay area...but i recommend it to anyone.

i just watched the documentary "fog city mavericks" on the starz cable tv network. it is without a doubt, one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! it chronicles the san francisco bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made. in addition to the well-known artists listed, t also includes segments with irvin kershner, caleb deschanel and a segment about pixar animation studios. i hope it will be released on dvd-this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film-making. if you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.

i drove from sacramento to san francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and really glad i did. as a big movie fan and a life-long northern californian, i was surprised how many oscar-winning films have been made in the bay area. as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la, george lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision really resonated with me. hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in sf, so can other artists. would recommend this film

this film is brilliant! it touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way. it really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories. there are so many layers to this film. it is innovative and absolutely fabulous!

ok - you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin - then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban 80's. more than any movie i has ever seen, the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never dull, and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear-frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion. mini-mogul darren stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict kid's world. what he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty - but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age. what does change mean without reflection. i love this movie.

i was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary, and i waited a good while for this to come through the pipes (my local video chain), and it was worth the wait. i like a good documentary / special interest piece, but this was definitely a heartfelt, honest, and nostalgic, if you will, look back on adolescent life. the imagination of a child is fascinating, and that's where a great story begins. rent it or buy it if you like a good, humorous, and all around entertaining documentary. mr. stein and company have definitely come a long way from neighborhood video camcorder productions of bank hold-ups, and gay-rings that turn people gay from one glance. they all seem rather successful in they're respectful fields, and it was good to know that they are all still good friends. the dvd has a few extra trailers for other good documentaries, and it features a number of darren's most notable productions, including, crazy news.

put the camera on me is a deceptively cute film. it is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. on the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. one of the film's directors, darren stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies. sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. but, this is also much more. this is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us. as we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little. what makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young darren stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker. it is clear that darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life. a lot of children make home movies, but i've never heard of or seen children create "little" movies about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends. these kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff! the power of this film is the way stein and shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids --- all now adults and all still friends. this adds a new angle to the film. how many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends? these guys have. and, many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later. among the conflicts -- a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken, a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a "sticky" subject between two of the men, some ongoing resentments over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage! which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years. darren stein is a director. no doubt about it. stein and shell take turns chatting with each other from time to time and one can't help but imagine the awkwardness of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people. this is particularly true for stein who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. from the first moment of put the camera on me we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out. we also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always "nice" or "caring" --- and, this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience. there are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a nazi. we discover thru interviews and narration that the nazi is played by a jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a gentile child. it is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child. this is much more than some home movies. this documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. powerful stuff --- and well worth seeing! :

it brings to mind the writings of stephen king and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like it - as the exact opposite. there is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who are still friends 20 years up the line - remember or seem to suffer from. up the line all is described as friendly jostling, maybe periodically described as "picking on" one or more of them, but all is forgiven. there is no *angst* embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons. more mature, but basically still the same people, and the same power structures.totally amazing! not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can in fact last. in this respect this movie is a tiny pearl - as one assumes this has been the intent of the film: a portrait of unforced emotions binding people together. which, when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions in bowling for combine is what easily springs to mind, but since mid 80'ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood (accompanied by 1000s of commercials, animations and series directed straight at children) several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up - the abuse, the loneliness, the push to excel - resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds.and here comes a film, that says: it is possible to have a happy childhood, look'a'here!thank you for that. or the counterweight illusion ...8/10

twisted, bizarre, enchanting, and hilarious! i couldn't stop laughing watching this film. darren stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980's. it's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera. manipulation is a strong word, however don't we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another? from the beginning, i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible. later, darren comments about his budding homosexuality, and you can see it from the hints (big hints!) of flamboyance at an early age. maybe it was just the warm southern california weather, who knows? as a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment, it's great to see that his parents supported and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lens."put the camera on me" offers a look back to the 80's untouched by commercialism. you'll remember the hair, the music, and the fashions. i'm the same age as mr. stein, so the trip back to memory lane was welcome. his solo lip-syncing dance number is priceless, enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood t-shirt.the films deal with dark themes at time. child abuse, the holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy, and social dysfunction. no childhood is completely carefree, and the way stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least, and hilarious to behold.watch at your earliest convenience!

before i begin, let me tell you how great this stand-up special sounds when you play sonic adventure i dx: director's cut at the same time (red mountain level in particular). so while watching this stand-up special, i suggest-- no, demand you do it.carlos mencia takes his stand-up to the extreme in san francisco, california. there, he makes fun of everybody with absolutely no apologies.i am pretty much thanking god here that carlos didn't do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again. he does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it; i know a couple of times i said, after carlos said a joke, "damn, this guy makes a good point!" and then the game over screen came over my tv because i forgot i was playing sonic adventure i dx: director's cut. my bad :) so yeah, there's nothing to complain about this stand-up special. if you have tivo or something like that, please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour.

carlos mencia was excellent this is hour special. he was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal. i know people have said he's stolen material in this special, but that is not true. carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, that is why he is so good. people say he's not funny because he says dee dee dee too much, and they still haven't realized thats part of his act, and they don't want it that way, but he brings it like that anyway, and succeeds in making people laugh. for all the haters out there, here is a message, carlos is here to stay, you have no point in trying to bring him down.

no strings attached is one of carlos mencia's best performances to date. mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues. however, he does more than that in this stand-up performance, which took place in san francisco. in general, mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today.in this hour long performance, mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion of mel gibson's passion of the christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by jesus, and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped. mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke.carlos mencia is not afraid to offend, which at many times gets him trouble with his critics. for example, he does go somewhat far (and he admits it) with a joke regarding pope john paul ii and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now. mencia's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. he reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as americans.if you enjoy this performance, i definitely recommend watching mind of mencia, his show on comedy central.

no strings attached features carlos mencia doing stand-up that makes us both laugh and think. not only does he poke fun at racial issues (like many haters claim), but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country...what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally...why americans are crazier than arab terrorists...why nobody needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes he's doing in heaven...a theory of how easter (aka big ups to jesus day) traditions got started...his viewing of the movie passion of the christ - and his sub-sequential argument with a woman about whether or not he's affected by jesus...how society should treat the physically handicapped...and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not.also, he never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice. so we should use it to speak the truth, say what we think, and not be afraid if others are offended.carlos is the bomb.

as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves, we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from broken in disc form. and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation.with regards to the latter, the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer. otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio, demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected. indeed, given ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact.the same is also true of the soundtrack. here we are offered both dd2.0 and dd5.1 mixes and whilst i'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the "original", the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior. indeed, though the dd5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score, both are equally fine and free of technical flaws.as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries, loads of featurettes and various galleries. indeed, given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary, there really is little to discuss. the 'anatomy of a stunt' featurette, for example, is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes for the rest of pieces. as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken's pre-production, production and post-production. and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of', in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view.of the various pieces, then, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion. then again, there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks. the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously. ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. and the technical ones are, well, extremely technical. of course, we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs, but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome. indeed, all in all, a fine extras package.

an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume. enter broken, and aggressively promoted, twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare. but is it any good as a film, or does it only work as a demo piece? ah, there in lies the rub.broken is the story of bonnie clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by "a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage" (quote from the video box). as she's held captive, it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she didn't know about herself. while they question her, a black-clad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her. mayhem ensues.fortunately for us, director alex ferrari seems to know what he's doing, or at least he's very good at faking it. broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair, which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved. what it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing. think long kiss goodnight meets the matrix, written ten minutes after reading fight club. the good news for ferrari and producer/writer jorge rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display. does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators? no, not really.though it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length. broken is no genre classic. the biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full-length feature. the final "twist" doesn't get enough build up time to be shocking. if ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed, plot elements would seem less random, and the film more complete. here's to knowing he's getting the chance.audio broken's dolby digital 5.1 presentation is second to none in the indie world. i've never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature. the matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, gunshots have punch, and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects. of everything presented on this disc, it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent dvd production. also included is an equally impressive dolby 2.0 surround track, which is the menu default.extras there are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc. there are so many extras, in fact, that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here, while still expecting my readers to continue reading. whatever shortcomings the actual short may have, the dvd is unprecedented in its informational resources. people who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production, including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign. those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these features.the extras are broken down into categorical menus. these include: pre-production, production, post-production, after the short, and cast and crew bios. from a critical standpoint, i found that some of the sections were quite short. had they been edited into one featurette per menu option, they would've been less frustrating to navigate, as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu. this is, of course, just nitpicking, but perhaps for future dvd releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heart.it has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people, and despite the consonant salesmanship, their true colours do shine through.the willingness to share their film-making secrets with anyone who picks up this dvd is quite generous. from the extras i learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective, what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price, even where to get cheap air soft weaponry. on top of this, i was given several alternate options, in case i found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production. wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this dvd.overall i've scored the actual short as a 6 out of 10, but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort, because i'd have scored it an 8 or 9 in these fields. i recommend the dvd for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand american dollars. those who purchase the dvd can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project, as the more attention these guys get, the more funding the feature-length version will get.

in my line of work, i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film. when i can, i take a look at these low-budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs. once in a while, though, there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible. the short film b r o k e n, directed by alex ferrari, is a genuine surprise and worth a second look.clocking in at a scant 20 minutes, b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no back story. the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening. a young woman (samantha jane polay) awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home. when she awakes, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book. these nasty guys and girls are larger than life. they are all guns and knives. there is no way out.the kicker here is that, despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one. from the very beginning, the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot, edited, and produced by professionals. it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers. the film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big.the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films. polay and paul gordon (who plays the head killer, duncan) were well chosen. as two of the few speaking roles in the film, it is up to them to carry the film. no special effects, no matter how good, would have saved this film from bad acting. thankfully, polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho. some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent, but it hardly shows.the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long. the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle. watching it, i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany, but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be. the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop, but it comes off as unsatisfying. i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film.my rating: 8 out of 10.

the young lady's name is bonnie (polay). she's attractive, is apparently living a pretty decent life, but all of a sudden is inexplicably snatched from her home and life by evil dude and the various and sundry evil henchmen. now she has no idea what the hell is going on, only that a bunch of armed-to-the-teeth people apparently want her dead...and she's going to die not even knowing why.god, i hear the whining all the time. now that content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own movies/books/comics/internal organs, there's going to be nobody to ensure that there's a standard of quality! we're going to be drowning in crap! the only people who actually think this are people who haven't watched any movies or read any books recently-- because we're already doing a dead man's float in crap. it's folks like ferrari and rodriguez who put the lie to these ignorant so-and-sos by throwing $8k on the table and making...well, what i would say is a better action flick than anything you've seen in cinemas this year...but you haven't seen any action flicks in the cinema this year. i've seen the box office. you're staying away in droves. you would do better to snag a copy of this, spend twenty minutes being entertained, and get on with your lives.it's sheer entertainment. you enter, like bonnie, with a lot of questions and where the whole thing ends up is nebulous. the whole conceit has been done before in multiple ways but not in such a compressed amount of time and not without such concentrated tasty gunplay. you're there for the atmosphere, the mystery, and the guns. that's it--that's all the filmmakers promise, and they deliver.it warms the black pits of my heart to think this was made on such a budget. we get passed a goodly number of indie films around here, but seldom do we see anything as polished as this short is, and we've never seen one done in the action genre that looked this good. hell, you could hand these two guys mi: 3 and it might draw me into watch it. the bond franchise. hell, anything. no, in fact, better yet: i'd like to see these guys make a feature on their own and stay the hell away from hollywood. whatever's out there killing the movie industry is no doubt infectious.best indie we've seen in a while and the most effective indie calling card we've ever seen. the dvd's $20 and has bonus features out the ass. go take your movie ticket budget and put it towards this instead.

i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face. the camera, all too often, focuses on fat people, on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas. while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer, the cinematography exploits and demeans them. there were, undoubtedly, thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat, organized homes, but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen. i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements. i can assure you, as a frequent visitor to france, that all is not well there. foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated, thus creating severe social inequities. but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u.s., so we're not likely to see films on the subject.

i just love malle's documentaries. they are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating. i have no idea why this documentary works. it is about glencoe, minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. but still malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. his love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you just can't help but also to fall in love with them too. malle filmed most of it in 1979. he came back 6 years later to see what had changed. this would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great. it may sound like malle was just doing what has been done in the up series but in fact it is not. the up series are about people. malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community. and the change is great. 1985 is the reagan era and the farmers are suffering. once a proud community, now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming. this documentary is quite relevant today. our financial crises today started because of what was happening then. just take a look to these final words in the film, spoken by an older lawyer from the town (in 1985):"well i have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed. and a nation doesn't live long with that obsession. and particularly a democracy that... there's good - there's good - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren't gonna - they aren't gonna subscribe to this philosophy of greed that's going on now. it's horrible."unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened.

this film reinvents the term "spring breakumentary." hans, the fat one of the group, displays his talents as this generations chris farley. johnny kansas, "the king of the $1 bet," shows he's not in kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes. kyle's laugh is truly infecting, and offers a little eye-candy for the ladies as well (as does matt). the dwarfs, while having their moments, did not do justice to the mexican hat dance like it deserves. and last, we have our protagonist, ed. he gives hope to all of us bumbling, stumbling, gangly, pale folk who are still searching for that special someone. and that hope, is a little place called cabo san lucas. while this blockbuster just missed the theaters, this is a must rent, as we can all relate to one of these spring breakumentarions.

i can tell you just how bad this movie is. i was in the movie and i haven't seen it yet, but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk. especially considering what we did that year. the thing is that they probably over edited it. especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute (they probably should have followed him around). we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can't really remember anything. i was the mc in a few scenes (from what i'm told. what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world (or the girl that loser lost his virginity to). overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them.

i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes, i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me. notwithstanding this is not a "movie with a plot", its about real guys and some of the "problems" that they face. i found the movie hilarious(especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other). simply put, if you are in the same "wave-length" as these people, you will find this movie amazing. i don't think that this is going win any golden globes or oscars, or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars, but its a kind of "cult-classic" among young people who could relate to their experience. for me the guy that stands out the most is hans: the scandinavian guy,who ,according to him "isnt a looker", but gets all(or some) of the chicks. the "little-people" also play a big part in the movie, especially when they are drunk. if i keep going, i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that, just go and get the movie and you will not regret. i give it a 8/10

i loved this film, at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but i quickly got into it. there must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and i really admire the work done in cutting it down. if you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here, (and some real tossers). technically i liked it a lot too, they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but i wasn't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers. (open water drove me nuts, mostly because there are cheap, progressive cameras available now and i see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema). sorry that's my own little rant. i definitely recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious, i might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a classic piece.

i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols, and that is the reason i came watching this film.the uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it's not just about one page of a band's history (like "i am trying to break your heart", about wilco), but rather covers long period of the band's history. in this movie, director/producer ondi timoner closely followed friends/rivals the brian jonestown massacre (bjm) and the dandy warhols (dw) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video, cut than to 1:45 hours (the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film). the result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine archive footage, which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands, through all these years.both bands in the start of their careers promised to "make a revolution" in the music making, and not to sell their souls to the devil of "record industry". however, their paths quickly diverged - the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular (especially in europe) after only one album, while the brian jonestown massacre (with its self-destruction-bound leader anton newcombe) dissolved into oblivion (at least how it is portrayed in the film). and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre, contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols.first, i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe (for example, courtney taylor - the leader of the dandy warhols - narrates), but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film.first, it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person. the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups, in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners (that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands). it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project. in the end he was ignored completely, as if he was kicked out of the project. everybody talk about bjm, but he does not take part in the discussion. i guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process. there are always both sides of the story, and here we have only one... of course, as one would expect, anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends.second, the film is very dandy warhols-biased. sure, the winner takes it all, but the fact that courtney taylor (leader of dw) narrates (even though it seems a good choice - it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement) and that bands' late history is represented nonproportionally (bjm is covered till 1997, and dw - till 2003), does not add objectivity to the film.third, the movie is (somewhat) shallow. what does it want to teach us? as one critic said: "... movie examines old questions: where does genius fit into a commodified world? can it thrive and get its due, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity?" no, it does not examine these questions! it just depicts a story of a brilliant, but unsuccessful musician, narrated by a less brilliant, but successful one, who indulges in self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain.anyway, the movie was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's ... just god damn interesting, at least for the dw or bjm fans. for the rest of the crowd - i don't know...

dig! i would say to anyone even if you don't like metallica to see 'some kind of monster' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts. it's fun and fascinating. along the same lines comes dig! a film about 'the dandy warhol's' and 'the brian jonestown massacre' two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books. right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad. filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame (thanks to that vodaphone ad!) and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes. as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights. all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able. like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band. dig! on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band. still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path. dig! is a mad ride on rock and roll's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous.

damn, was that a lot to take in. i was pretty much mesmerised throughout. it was pretty perfect, though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that. i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious... beef. the dandy's did come off well-together, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton, which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt. great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s). i recommend this to any music/film fan. you'll probably learn something about film-making.

shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. i just wonder how that came to be made. there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there. if the scenes shot where the warhols descended on a bjm post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about. taken at face value, a nice portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be.

i first saw this film when i was flipping through the movie channels on my parents directv. it was on the sundance channel and was just starting. i love music, especially late 60s and this is what the bjm sounded like (the dandys are alright). everything about the brian jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music, to anton and joel's personalities, to the illicit drug use. it was funny because as i was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch (the look on their faces were priceless). anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the brian jonestown massacre who is now my favorite band of all time.just watch it... seriously

although dig! was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated. the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98. and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked. the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film.that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene.recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands.

anton newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. he thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting. the dw are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise. "hey, do you haver a drivers license?" ,anton says to the cameraman, "well lets go pawn this guitar!". great use of archive/ home video material. great to see rock docs still being made. a cool doc about the creative process. if you like this go see nirvana live! tonight! sold out! on dvd. a good experience anton is this film. 8 out of 10

i recently rented this doc, having remembered hearing about it from imdb.com and being intrigued by the premise. i knew very little about either of these bands, but i do remember hearing "not if you were the last junkie on earth" by the dandy warhols ages ago and enjoying it. that being said, this is my perspective on the doc:one thing i found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands. the director (ondi timoner) wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film. i quickly became grooved to the lives both anton and courtney as well as their respective bands, the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols. i think that is part of what makes this doc so good, and what makes ondi timoner such a master documentarian.i also loved how the "story" of these bands was told. most of what you see is of the bands on tour. both bands start out playing small venues and struggling to make it in the recording industry. throughout the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. however it is this that makes the two bands similar, and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions.i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general. you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries, or either of the bands. an appreciation for music helps, but the music itself takes a backseat to the love/hate relationship between the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols.

to suggest anton newcombe of the brian jonestown massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly. in dig! which won the grand jury prize at sundance, we watch him and his band self-sabotage over seven years, while ex-friends and contemporaries the dandy warhols rise to comparative greatness (a mobile phone advert, anyway).what elevates dig! above its contemporaries is the immense, near-biblical comic-tragedy being played out: a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise. for all his "look at me, i'm a bloody genius" posturing, newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted, if immensely troubled, musician - far more talented than his rival, the dandy's courtney taylor who narrates the picture. if newcombe is dennis hopper, taylor's peter fonda.even sadder, taylor appears to realise this, evinced by his weary, self-loathing voice-over: he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost? in truth, they sold out, made indie-lite records, kept their teeth nice and clean, and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus. and jettisoning all credibility in the process. newcombe, on the other hand, lives in filth, is continually busted, beats up fellow band members on stage, kicks hecklers in the head - and is last glimpsed in dig! being ferried away by police, having lost the right to see his child.two of the best films about rock's subculture have been directed by women: penelope spheeris's the decline of western civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released.

anton newcombe and courtney taylor are friends, they both are the leads in their own respective bands; anton with the brian jonestown massacre and courtney with the dandy warhols. what's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals; its a love hate relationship. at times you both hear them praising one another, but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are. while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success, bjm still was stuck in the underground scene; and for good reason why.the focus of dig! is more towards anton and the bjm, as they have a lot more substance. they are the most dysfunctional band. during gigs they will fight and bash each other. anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly. with the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume, fight was always waiting to happen. you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens; that's why people would go to their gigs, for the fights. anton is very unstable. always thinking himself as a music messiah, he wants to change music and create a revolution, but he could never get out of the underground. he is a very talented musician, its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill. but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs, alcohol and depression. on the other side, the dandy warhols were having their own troubles. they didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label. but they found huge success in europe. but courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of anton. its interesting that both anton and courtney both had what the other needed. courtney always wanted to be musically talented as anton, though anton wouldn't say it, he needed the commercial success that the dandy's had, to make his revolution.over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands, there is a lot of footage. there is never a dull moment in dig!. it is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say, seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job. ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more. even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure.you wont be disappointed.

the movie is about anton newcombe. the music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop. it's only fair that newcombe have the last word about the film, which at this writing you can find in the "news" section at the brianjonestownmassacre website. i'd link it here but imdb won't permit it.documentarians are limited by what the camera captures, as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat-random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight-line with relevant happenstance. in dig!, fortune smiled on the dandy warhols, capturing their rise to the status of pop-idol candidates, as they formed slickly-produced pop confections for mass consumption, most notably "bohemian like you," a song that made them global darlings thanks to a euro cell phone ad. no such luck for brian jonestown massacre. the film captures little of what made the original bjm lineup great, with the sole exception of a single montage, lasting a minute or so, showing newcombe creating/recording a number of brief instrumental parts, unremarkable in themselves, and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush, shimmering sounds that had to have been in newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world.three commentaries accompany the film; one by the filmmakers, and two by the members of the bands (the bjm track is solely former members, and without newcombe). both the warhols and bjm alumni point up this montage sequence as the "best" bit in the film, and i'd agree that, given the film's focus on anton newcombe, it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift, and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the "tortured artist."interesting thing about commentaries is that, unlike film, they are recorded in real time -- one long take -- which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing.the dandies do not come off well in their comments. if the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens -- as i believe it does -- the dandies are the popularity-obsessed preppy types, the ones who listen to rock because it's what their peers do, while the bjm crew come off as the half-rejected, half-self-exiled outsiders (to insiders like the dandies, "losers") that are the real rock spirit. bjm's joel gion, who talks a lot, nails the film's message for me when he says (paraphrasing): "you can't forget that anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do. make a lot of great music."the dandies, meanwhile, laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of newcombe's meltdown (all the bjm footage here ends at 1997, before newcombe quit heroin). courtney taylor-taylor's discounting of newcombe's commitment to his vision is summed up as follows: "he's 37 and still living in his car. you can download all his work at his website. he was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else, he's giving it all away. he could be making a mint." you can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief.the film's shortcomings can't be blamed on the filmmakers; rather it's the difficulties of the documentary form, and the loss of cooperation by the film's subject, that makes this portrait of newcombe so fragmentary. but it's likely the best we will get, outside of his music.i only rented disc one, which has the feature. most of the extras are on disc two. not renting that, as i've put in my order to buy the set.

dig! is funny, fun, amusing, interesting, stylish, and very well done. knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told, especially with such style and substance. if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see.focusing on the brian jonestown masssacre and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol, and insanity. if i did not know that this is footage of real people, i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece. the story is compelling, concise, and simply amazing.

a really cool flick. a must for any music snob. you don't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. before the movie, i only heard only two songs from the dandy warhols. the only thing is required is an open mind. the movie centers around the brian jonestown massacre. the dandy warhols have a role in the film, as the 'rival band,' but they are second fiddle to the bjm. the dandy warhols don't play as big of a role in the film as i originally guessed, but then again, they didn't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the bjm.you can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man, anton newcombe. by itself, it's an insightful film and study on the music industry. just watch this film and enjoy.

rock n' roll is a messy business and dig! demonstrates this masterfully. a project of serious ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. with that said, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. if you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing. the music in the film, although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is worth the price of admission alone. the morning after i saw dig! i went straight to the record store to pick up a brian jonestown massacre album (i was already initiated to the dandy warhols' sounds). primarily defined by its exploration of rock music, the film succeeds at other profound levels. dig! is a sincere, and sufficiently objective, glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.

excellent documentary, ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two west coast retro rock'n'roll bands: the dandy warhols and the brian jonestown massacre. what it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath - anton newcomb - and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world. interestingly, for a music documentary, there is hardly any music. what there is - snatches of songs, more often than not aborted by the performers - is incidental rather than central. although the protagonists are musicians, the story is not about music but rather about a particularly american version of a british myth of a cartoon lifestyle, ie, one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a full-time basis. tantrums, drugs, violence, grossly dysfunctional attitudes, egomania on a truly epic scale - all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rock'n'roll is about. as a film this is a first-class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers. for example, why is anton's music so conservative? for someone so wild and outrageous (and he is wild and outrageous) his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols (the stones, velvets etc.) for someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most rudimentary level. similarly, the dandy warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll which is astonishingly fossilised in 1969. nothing wrong with pastiches, of course, but surely there's more to musical life than perpetually acting out a cartoon from the late 60s. why don't they take some risks with their music - in the way that their role models did? because, one suspects, this is not about music. music is just an accessory, a prop, or an excuse, to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives. but why? in the dandy warhols case, the answer is obvious: to make lots of money and be famous. big deal. anton newcomb's case is more interesting. he is obviously very talented, but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it, usually in the most dramatic way possible. he is terrified of success, and at the same time, deeply resents anyone else who has it - especially his former friends the dandy warhols. fascinating movie. highly recommended.

i couldn't find anyone to watch dig! with me because no one i knew was a fan of either of the bands. naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either the dandy warhols or the brian jonestown massacre, but this is so far from the truth. the only requirement is that you have an interest in music and/or pop culture in general. the way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take, and watching the public eat up and spit out the dandy warhols is fascinating. i agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from anton himself, since he's clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the band's ability to just remain.most interesting to me is the dandys' respect for the bjm (despite their lack or reciprocation) and for anton (despite his erratic behavior). the dandy warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the dandy warhols now stand for (although that's disputable). the best line is when the drummer for the dandy's says "i won't have them anywhere new me again" and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out "i'll still buy their records though." to me, this just shows how powerful good music can be.definitely see this movie, even if you know nothing of either band. it's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting. it's rare to follow a group so closely for so long.

a documentary about two rocks bands, spanning a number of years. brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols. what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure.anton newcombe, the main man of brian jonestown massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the dandy warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all bjm's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable.the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the warhols have something that bjm don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' dig! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. at one point, newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe. by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like 'every day should be a holiday' and 'bohemian like you', newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass.the wider appeal of dig! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. the downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. in the words of one of the band members: "in every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up." newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and dig! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius.

this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties. much more fun than than palazzo volpi, though just as diseased, this movie is a true gem of squalor. one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness . the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz. here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized. the characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer, creating a "phenomenon of a phenomenon" effect which makes this movie a piece of art.

after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit, mi, and having friends who traveled to new york balls, i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member. i joined the house of theieves. we adapted the same rules as most houses, but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired. i even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver's license and cash them in over seventeen states, until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison. but, i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself. you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in. my book, identity schemes is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity schemes dot com. but trust me, it is a lot better than paris is burning, because its a 2005 make.

i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over 10 years ago, i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write. i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary. it did what it set out to do, show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored. i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the "balls" was just spectacular to me. these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. the catty folks, the complainers (even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat!), the jealous, it's all there like in every other competition. like every other competition like it. which i felt was a point.you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls "used" to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was that important to them! then there was sad stories, stories of who's "house" and "house mother" brought out the best and the brightest in competition. it was interesting.now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, i lived through the so called 'madonna' craze. i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her "vogue" phase and rightfully so. if not for those individuals, madonna wouldn't have had a "vogue" phase, i know that now. credit should be given where credit is due. makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary, they'll learn they're not as "mainstream" as they think.

yeah this films is tops. cant recommend it more. gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film. very funny, sad and interesting. never dull. great access. a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter. some of the performances and just amazing. if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching. great. 10 out of 10. i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching. the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy- weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto. the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement. cool. track it down.

wonderfully put together..i wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. it was great..the film wasn't long enough..i would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...i am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't; actually its the hetero's that we need to look into..this film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for that..i really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.

the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in. it is well made and very powerful. the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective. i believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society. it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. some parts were difficult to watch, as most reality is, but it is not over done. its good the first time you watch it, but it becomes even better the second or third time around; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge.

fifteen years later and paris is burning is still aflame. this is a classic in black gay films, right up there with the other honorary black gay films, the color purple and mahoganoy. this seminal work captures underground and underclass (i.e."underserved) black and latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since, including all the sentimental harlem rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings. they're good, but this is the best (dare i say the only "real") film you'll find on the subject. it's relentlessy cunty (the classic house music invention)comes to hollywood, non-stop, hilarious camp (like only we do it) and dead-on social critique. all this by a white female director (who obviously must have been a sister gurl or mizz thing in a former life.) i could go on, but i think you get the point by now: i love this movie!

when paris is burning came out, i totally dismissed it. i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon. i thought it was going to be campy and silly. how wrong i was about this movie. i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it. it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally. the 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture. what a terrific job! i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them. if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know. i hope they make another documentary. i loved it

growing up in nyc in the late 80's/early 90's club-scene, i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period. no madonna did not come up with the idea of voguing but this is where she got it from! instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights, voguing allowed people to "fight" within the confines of everything short of touching each other (which would warrant an automatic disqualification). seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented/well orchestrated "throw-downs" in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here...pepper la beija, paris duprée,xtragavaganza, etc...all commemorated in the likes of such period-pieces as malcom mclaren's song "deep in vogue"...it didn't matter who you were, or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this "magic kingdom" of sorts, you became part of something bigger than yourself/you were important/and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination...and anybody from anywhere could become king (or queen) as the case may have been. the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor. all of the tension, excitement, and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film. brilliant!!! please release on dvd for the world to see!!! thank you!

documentary starts in 1986 in nyc where black and hispanic drag queens hold "balls". that's where they dress up however they like, strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on. we get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other. as one man says to another--"you have three strikes against you--you're black, gay and a drag queen". these are people who (sadly) are not accepted in society--only at the balls. there they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted. then the film cuts to three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some). sounds depressing but it's not. most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations. they're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor--just as they should. we find out they all live in "houses" run by various "mothers" and all help each other out. the sense of community in this film is fascinating.when this film came out in 1990 it was controversial--and a big hit. it won best documentary awards at numerous festivals--but was never even nominated for an academy award. their reason was "black and hispanic drag queens are not academy material". fascinating isn't it? homophobia and racism all together. seen today it's still a great film--and a period piece. it just isn't like that anymore--the ny they show no longer exists. the balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here. also drag has become more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). and i've heard the houses are gone too. that's kind of sad. i would like to know where these characters are now--i know two died of aids but i have no idea about the others. and what did happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown? still, it a one of a kind documentary--fascinating, funny and riveting. a must see all the way! a definite 10. where's the dvd???

an excellent documentry. i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80's. this movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time period.this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real. the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written. the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties. that time is gone forever. this is a good pre "homo thug" movie. when queens were really proud to be extroverts. goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film!

this film came out 12 years years ago, and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york. the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses. anthony slide's 'great pretenders' says nothing. julian fleisher's "the drag queens of new york: an illustrated field guide" with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge, minette, the warhol queens, and the 90s club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely. even laurence senelick's "the changing room" - the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it.i understand from the film itself,and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades. the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be chrystal la beija in "the queen", 1968. the historical context is the biggest missing part of "paris is burning".the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored. it is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real-life murder. as we now know, dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet, but this did not come out until three years later.of historical importance, but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context.

first of all i am a butch, straight white male. but even with that handicap i love this movie. it's about real people. a real time and place. and of course new york city in the 80's. i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them. no matter what the consequences. that's courageous. you have to admire that. this is a great film, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties. it's real life. bottom line it's real life.

while many unfortunately passed on, the ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy. some are still very much alive and quite well, octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, willi ninja is very accomplished and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole, pepper labeija just passed on last year of natural cause, may she rest in peace. after anji's passing carmen became the mother of the house of xtravaganza (she was in the beach scene) and she is looking more and more lovely as well. some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed, may they all rest in peace. there is currently another project underway known as "how do i look?", you can check out the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.

in the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him: he is black and male. but in addition to that, he has a third strike: he's gay. "you're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he is told. "paris is burning" is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals.the miracle of "paris is burning" is that director jennie livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity. we learn their views of homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. some of these dreams are so unattainable it's tragic. many of the people are seriously in denial;this is not a film for everyone. there are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals. if you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie isn't for you. but if you do see this movie you'll realise "paris is burning" isn't really about men wearing women's clothes, it's about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large, and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives.i've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says so many things: it's a commentary about materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about rich and poor people, about the media and what it celebrates, about fame and adulation. "paris is burning" is one of the most humane, and one of the saddest, movies i've ever seen.

this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer. few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence, and i can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it. there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much. yes, it is about dmd and accessible travel; on those issues alone, it is a worthwhile venture, but it is more. it is about friendship. it is about life itself, about living every day that you're alive. and it's a great, fun, adventurous narrative. this is why god created the cinema! see this movie!!!

this is a must-see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real-life adventure and its sense of morality. darius goes west is an amazing roller-coaster of a story. we live the lives of darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime. darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease which affects all the muscles in his body. he is confined to a wheelchair, and needs round-the-clock attention. so how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a 6,000 mile round-trip to the west coast and back? watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way, and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises!

i tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now i've seen the film!! what a ride! and what a trip to finally get to know darius weems! such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! and what a crew! to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at panama city, to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. this film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. and the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. they got darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took darius on the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. by raising awareness of dmd and encouraging funding for research, this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west - a cure for dmd.

i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival, and there was not a dry eye in the house. it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is, but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age.it also made me think how disgusting mtv was, and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way, they declined. shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all.it's a wonderful and heart warming true story...take your tissues but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be.

this movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15-year-old darius weems. darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy, a still un-curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the united states. him and a few close friends travel across the country to los angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on mtv's, pimp my ride, one of his favorite shows. the journey begins in georgia, where darius grew up and has never left. the gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget. darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time, ride in a hot air balloon, swim in the ocean and visit sights he's always wanted to see like the grand canyon and new orleans. the filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material. they make no money from sales of the $20 dvds. $17 goes toward researching the disease and $3 goes toward making more copies. the film has won over 25 awards at festivals and i agree with the quote given to the film by variety, "certain to stir hearts".

darius goes west is an amazing documentary about a teenager (weems) with duchenne muscular dystrophy, and his 11 friends who take him on a cross-country trip to see if "pimp my ride" will pimp out his wheelchair.i recently watched this movie at the sunscreen film festival. it played twice over the course of the festival. this movie is an amazing story about the human spirit, and the spirit of weem's friends. i do not say this often about movies, but after watching this movie, i feel moved to do something towards the cause. every festival this movie has taken part in, this movie has won an award of some kind. it is in the tribeca film festival, and it is going to london and athens, greece. i would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the academy awards. it is snowballing out of control. if anyone has a chance to see this movie, wherever it is playing, go! take as many people as possible, and go! it is heading to new orleans for a film festival, then on to atlanta and palm beach, fl. darius is from georgia, so i expect the tickets for the atlanta showing will be sold out quickly, if they are not already. please, go see this movie! dgw (talk about it)-kish

darius goes west is a film depicting american belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. this wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected, but longed to see, what was outside the confines of his lovely city of athens, ga. darius wished to see the ocean. his longtime friends logan, ben and several other good friends decided to make darius' wish come true. they started small - ben & logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to darius' condition: duchenne muscular dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great united states. to say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. they realized darius' dream and then some. they put their lives on hold while showing love, care and tons of fun to darius while helping darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from dmd. darius went on to volunteer for the red cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) outside a local grocery store. his wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. give darius and all the guys an oscar - no one else deserves it more. martha sweeney.

i have one word to someup this movie, wow! i saw "darius goes west" at the tribeca film festival. people in the theater were sobbing. this movie shows the hardships that darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy. the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie, i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy, some people in this world are less fortuate then us. and sometimes we should give them a had and help them, to the very end. i would give them ten stars, they gave darius a had when they weren't asked to, they did't do it for the money they did it for a friend in need, darius, the world should know, darius went west.

"darius goes west" is the touching story of a brave teen coping with duchenne's muscular dystrophy and his personal quest to see the pacific ocean. he receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest.the story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease.anyone who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head. it is the power of the young people and their engagement with darius' plight that is very compelling in this documentary.

after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy, bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler: diva las vegas, a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas. midler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's, proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business. from her opening number, her classic "friends", where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud, bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called "i look good" she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections. the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage (even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it, but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical). bette also treats us to "rose's turn" from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club. she brings the house down near the end with "stay with me, baby" from the rose and her only #1 hit record, "wind beneath my wings" from beaches. it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans, it's a must.

a longtime fan of bette midler, i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites. bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. a literal rainbow of emotion and talent, bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the "bette of roses" album. spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone. the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around.

love it, love it, love it! this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m. from the beginning to the end, this is one big treat! don't rent it- buy it now!

bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in "diva las vegas". i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to. she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you. the highlight of the show was her singing "stay with me" from her 1979 movie "the rose". you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps. the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler's albums.

bette midler is indescribable in this concert. she gives her all every time she is on stage. whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, bette midler moves her audience. if you can't see it live (which is the best way to see bette) then this is the next best thing. an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. her more "vocally correct" version of "stay with me" never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness, here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. i will treasure this concert for a very long time.

bette midler is again divine! raunchily humorous. in love with burlesque. capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever. all in all singing new ballads, power-singing the good old/perennial ones such as "the rose"; "stay with me" and yes, even "wind beneath my wings". the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it, i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries!

reviewed at the world premiere screening sept. 9, 2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival (tiff).this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship. still, what was there was interesting. the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well. scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang-je films at tiff (the feature still life/sanxia haoren & the documentary dong) which were also built around that subject.director jennifer baichwal, producer nick de pencier, cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q&a after the world premiere. producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself.

i had nowhere to go. i was on a flight to vancouver. i would probably have missed this film if i hadn't chosen air canada. watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front, i found this captivating and mesmerising. i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it's end. now i'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i'll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door, is yet to be discovered!the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills out' the story the photographs tell.recommended (if you have time on your hands).

edward burtynsky is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least "artful" objects imaginable. everyday items such as crates, boxes, metal containers, etc. - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d'art by burtynsky's camera. he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them, that is. even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through burtynsky's lens (but didn't we already know that from "wall-e"?). he is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e. the workers in those places), with their uniform clothing and robotic movements, become part of the industrial landscape."manufactured landscapes," a documentary about burtynsky's work, has much of the feel of a "koyaanisqatsi" about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns. indeed, director jennifer baichwal and cinematographer peter mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms, as their own camera records burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china, a dockyard in bangladesh, and the construction site at the massive three rivers gorge dam project in china. with their fluid camera-work, the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of burtynsky's images. in fact, the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows.the movie does less well when burtynsky gets around to articulating the "themes" of his work, which, quite frankly, come out sounding confused, contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best. but it is as a purely aesthetic experience, highlighting image and form, that "manufactured landscapes" resonates most. in the case of burtynsky, perhaps, a picture really is worth a thousand words.

this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen. it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of china, edward burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore.taking no political sides, this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by-products of economical growth, the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities, the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles.amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. this is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues. 10/10 definitely!

i had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape. it certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations, setup shots, and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide. put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show.this film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river. each sequence stands on its own, but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability. there are few words, this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way. an awful, massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories. individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our e-waste. the birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards. the construction of the three gorges dam, the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time. the time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was.the most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control. the shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees, demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters.the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries. the artist edward burtynsky explains the method wonderfully. 'by not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep. it is not a simple right or wrong. it needs a whole new way of thinking'. the subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition, but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side.though never stated directly in any way, as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate, there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed. the progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in. what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise. unlike most films with environmental themes, this one ends with no call to arms. it argues basically what's the point, but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally.

mesmerizing, breathtaking and horrifying, this hauntingly beautiful film is the "apocalypse now" without fiction. slow in pace, quiet in mood, it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom.there is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease. greed, the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, has turned us into something like cancer, on its way to consume the host and die with it...manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again.

this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things, parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isn't really made very clear. the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're herded around outside in little yellow jackets. the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory, and talking with his crew as he does so. this is a world of relentless industrialization. it's a relief at least to know these soulless images aren't going to be presented without a human voice, as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry, 'our daily bread.' 'manufactured landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever, with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is. some of these scenes, the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places, might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer sebastião salgado. but this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close. his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold, neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz.all this happens in china, of course, though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh. it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive. there are a good many stills of the photographer's work--or were some of them made by the film crew? it isn't made clear.edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer. we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow. the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted, and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring. he admits himself that he takes no political stand. when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film's cinematographer peter mettler, burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification, and hence falsification. but he is showing us places that, if we look closely, reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.logically, but not entirely fortunately, it is burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites. burtynsky's "epiphanies" may have inspired his decades of fine work, but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we're changing the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil, which will run out; that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late, and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel. the interest of 'manufactured landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it. the reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of burtynsky's work and the raw materials, the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully; and to observe scenes from the vast, awesome, daunting, and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china.because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title 'manufactured landscapes' feels insufficiently developed. it even seems a misnomer. new landscapes they are, but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than "manufactured." 'landscapes of waste' or 'wasted landscapes' might be better titles. there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions.

i have been an admirer of edward burtynsky's work for years, and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work, thanks to jennifer baichwal's documentary. the severe beauty of the ship-breaking yard in bangladesh, the stone quarry in vermont, the enormous assembly plant in china, the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down: these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker.at times i thought of old tv documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic-mold factories; the sort of stuff i grew up watching. burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to asia, it has not stopped. the strangest scene for me was the computer scrap-yard somewhere in china--the waste had a threatening air about it, while the workers were very jovial.

this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like "the corporation" and "fahrenheit 9/11." its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature. the film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed - while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress. truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children. bravo!nb - this is also the only film (of 8) at varsity theaters (toronto) boasting a stick-on tag which reads... "to arrange group viewings please contact...." ... a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem.my bet... an academy award nomination for best documentary.ob101
