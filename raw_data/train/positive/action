i liked the film. some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it. a very tense action scene that seemed well done.some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. also the film is funny is several parts. i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. i'd give the film an 8 out of 10.

somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless, fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u.s. treasury agent (david morse) to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief/hacker (doug hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead."bait" marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua ("the replacement killers") and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie. what the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are flat-out excellent.foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning, but throughout the film, i began to catch on. hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in "marathon man". morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost.

verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. he's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. by his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.heinlein would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. it basically steals the name, mocks politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some t&a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn't get bored.this anime isn't perfect, but it's at least mostly accurate, as best i can tell.

robert a. heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series, to a number of games. but none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. the games are usually unrelated, the tv series was more of a spin off, and the less said about verhoeven's film, the better. little do most know, however, that in japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of heinlein's death. and, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic.the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film. like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. while events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. the big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.overall, i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein. and i think they did pretty well with this. if you can find this series, give it a look.

ok, let's get this clear. i'm really not into sci-fi, but for some reason i love stargate sg-1. jack o'neil takes his team sg-1 through a stargate. a round device that creates a wormhole. it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. it might sound like your usual sci-fi-series, but it's not! the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series. i find that great. it gives you things, happenings and such you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets. they have some of course but thanks to o'neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there's not many. the series has a nice blending of action, humor and drama. if you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here. they don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects.

i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons. sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more. atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons. and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead. this tv show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it !!!!! 10/10

fact: stargate sg-1 is a cheesy sci-fi tv series.there's no escaping facts. how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi tv series.stargate sg-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly. special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair. or couch for that matter either.but, and this is where i really think stargate sg-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode.in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies.and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg-1 special.i am very picky with my selections. i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught.so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show, don't. stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about.

one of the first ova's ("original video animation") i ever bought, this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles. a cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set against an unlikely (for a comedy, that is) background of near-future pollution in a dystopian society.the "heroes" of dominion are the tank police, formed with a "if we can't beat crime, we'll get bigger guns" philosophy, and who are, like the name suggests, patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch. most, if not all, of these cops are borderline(?) psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase "loose cannons".equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries, terrorist buaku and his hench(wo)men, the twin cat sisters, whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time.the animation is not state of the art, but it's very nice otherwise; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion.the english dubbing is, again, lots of fun. the soundtrack of the english version is also very good. i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that...anyway, dominion tank police is great. it's japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy, filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations, making sure that it never takes itself seriously. highly recommended.

dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt, one of the most amazing shows ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. while the first part (acts 1 and 2) mostly consists of action and fun, the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part. the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part (acts-3 and 4). i do have some complaints though. in the first part, the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all. one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool. buaku rules.

the anime that got me hooked on anime...set in the year 2010 (hey, that's not too far away now!) the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! oh the insanity!the "heroes" of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki, a red haired japanese woman (yeah i know, they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond, blue eyed nice guy al. leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain (also known as "brenten"), a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper. britain didn't like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare "where the boys are more your size" as he puts it. there's also specs, the bifocal genius, bible quoting/god fearing chaplain, purple mo-hawked mohican, and the pot bellied chief, who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics. seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they're not very well liked by the people.the "villains" are a cyborg named buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as "green peace", his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna & uni puma. in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku. the story, however, was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic ("manga") book that's very hard to find.all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you'd better go get quentin tarantino. uneven in places but still a lot of fun.followed by "new dominion: tank police".

i love this show!every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is. i am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science (fiction?) show in the history of film/tv. there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion. its amazing, season after season the show gets better and better.i've been a fan of macgyver since i was 5 (19 now) and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson. its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.back when i first saw stargate the movie, i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks, then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited, but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over.though, i'm disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead. id say though that it turned out just fine. maybe even better.this show is amazing, and i hope it never dies. atlantis here we come!

i stumbled across this (act-i) by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago. this was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned. it amazed me. it intimidated me. it shocked me. i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later, i happened to think about it again. then went and bought both acts. they were even better than i had experienced at first.my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime, warranting tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals. that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time. if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly has not been shown as such.i don't think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this. but regarding the story, there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused.

dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making. the storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action, slap-stick humor, touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions. it's hard to believe that there was only one director, as the style changes from episode to episode. a must-see movie for anyone who likes anime.

i love jack's jokes like 'the cliché is...' or "over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky...". he is just hilarious! daniel's starting to catch up on him to! good thing jack's not on the team anymore (in a way) or else it would have been sarcasm mania!!!!i just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, i have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, i'm starting to pick up facial expressions (and more) from jack, daniel and teal'c...it just all theoretically possible and exciting...oops! their i go again!!! sorry, i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter, and all of this is driving my parents nutz!!!!!!! well, to conclude, i think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so forth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

stargate sg-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie "stargate." i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject. the show gets it rolling from the very first episode, a retired jack o'neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion, dr. daniel jackson. through the first two episodes, we meet samantha carter, a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her, and there is teal'c, a quiet, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. the main bad guys are called the gouald, they are parasites who can get inserted into one's brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds. any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a "system lord." the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa, who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person's brain.through the episodes, we mostly get to see sg-1, the exploratory team comprised of jack/daniel/teal'c/and sam, go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets (this device is called the stargate) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys. some episodes are on-world, meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth.through the years, you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit, and more character-building story lines. this, in turn means even more on-world episodes, which is perfectly understandable.my rating: 8.75/10----while most of this show is good, there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years. but still, top notch science fiction!

stargate sg-1 follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate. in the stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa'uld such as ra and apophis. for millennia, the goa'uld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. as a result, earth cultures such as those of the aztecs, mayans, britons, the norse, mongols, greeks, and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy. many well-known mythical locations such as avalon, camelot, and atlantis are found, or have at one time existed.presently, the earth stargate (found at a dig site near giza in 1928) is housed in a top-secret u.s. military base known as the sgc (stargate command) underneath cheyenne mountain. col. jack o'neill (anderson), dr. daniel jackson (shanks), capt. samantha carter (tapping) and teal'c (judge) compose the original sg-1 team (a few characters join and/or leave the team in later seasons). along with 24 other sg teams, they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa'uld, in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races.the parasitic goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. throughout the first eight seasons, the goa'uld are the primary antagonists. they are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. the original arch-enemy from this race was the system lord apophis (peter williams). other system lords, such as baal and anubis, play pivotal roles in the later seasons. in the ninth season a new villain emerges, the ori. the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori, their followers, and their enemiesthe ancients.

it's amazing that from a good, though not wonderful, film made back in the early nineties, a whole franchise can grow. 'stargate; sg1' is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'star trek' as the kings of sci-fi.following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate', this series sees stargate command (a military/science organisation) figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore. sg1 is one such team, headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill, and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson, military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people. earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life. richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye. michael shanks, as daniel, brings heart and an will of steel to the character, who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed. amanda tapping, as carter, has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong, intelligent military scientist. christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety. and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness.almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs (often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson). guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers. sg1 also excels in humour, from o'neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd! sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death. it isn't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show, overall.

i wait for each new episode, each re-run with anticipation! the new look of sci-fi created by stargate sg-1 is a wonder that i hope will never end. to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. season #9 should be a thrill in itself. i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season, as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o'neill. the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. you cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake. also, you need a bigger role for the asgard - they are just too cool.

i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it! her inclusion as the silly 'vela' has brought the series down in my estimation. to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake.unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of 'jack' and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'farscape'.i was a great fan of the film "stargate" and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film, but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked. i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation

i started watching the show from the first season, and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it. original movie was kind of childish, and i was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the bsg new season.but after few episodes i became a fan. i've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is jack o'neill, the not-only-smart samantha carter, the glorious teal'c, women and kids favorite, and brilliant dr. daniel jackson.of course, stories sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend, even risking your life for him. it's about "we don't leave anybody behind". struggling to the end when all hope is lost. about the free will, and all good qualities that makes a human - human.and now it's breaking a record, going 10th season, and still doing good.

the movie was sub-par, but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci-fi fans ideal program. the actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either.stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite programs.

indian directors have it tough, they have to compete with movies like "laggan" where 11 henpecked,castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots. "devdas", a hapless, fedar- festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one's feelings or sentiments-alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry. but to make a good movie, you have to tight-rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum-dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit "bollywood" leading actor who is marginally handsome. so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words "defending his village" this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience. there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar (narasimhan). nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him, meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson.this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india. nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films. the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song&dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won't sell, a sad but true state of affairs. faster this changes better for "bollywood". all said and done this is one good movie.

i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought, hey! another film starring aishu and shah rukh, little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes. shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance. it's a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life. the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie. it's actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze. he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day, dressed scantily and begins to seduce him. the title of the song is 'ishq kamina' (loosely translated as "love's a bitch!") and it is just plain smoking hot! don't miss it.

good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. but the main point again as his movies tend to be, the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold. nana patekar. this may be his second best performance after parinda( others may disagree). although other movies are not far behind. one man that will never ever disappoint you.good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without. you can see in his movies, others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins. but this man is really something elase.the movie is cool, the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good. a must watch.

this is probably karisma at her best, apart from zubeidaa. nana patekar also gives out his best, without even trying. the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag, especially when shahrukh comes in the picture. what really made me like it were the performances of the leads, the dialog delivery, as well as the story, for what it was. it could've been directed better, and edited. the supporting case was even great, including karima's mother in law, even though she just had one shining moment, it was great to watch her.the sets were also pretty good. i didn't really like their portrayal of a canadian family, but once they step in india, it's as real as it gets.overall, i would give it a thumbs up!

a strong woman oriented subject after long, director krishna vamsi's shakti- the power, the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi's first home-production. a story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice.the story of the film revolves around nandini (karisma kapoor) who lives in canada with her two uncles (tiku talsania, jaspal bhatti). there she meets shekhar (sanjay kapoor), falls in love with him and they soon marry. their family is complete when nandini has a boy, raja (master jai gidwani). but their happiness is short lived, as the news of shekhar's ailing mother (deepti naval)makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india. and that's when the problems start. from the moment they reachindia, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere. they take a crowded train to reach shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village. the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never-ending drive. and unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus. fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him. after that, they drive to the handing havel where shekhar''s father, narsimha (nana patekar) lives with his wife (deepti naval). nandani realized that her father-in-law is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her mother-in-law's warm welcome.living there, nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him. the day she sees her father-in-law teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada. but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father-in-law. her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart-wrenching film.what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie. the only drawback is ismail darbar''s music, which fails to rise above the script. the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena, which has been composed by anu malik. another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast. karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother. she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal. second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film. his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role. sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors. deepti naval too is in top form and her pr-climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy. shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value. though his role was not really required, he's done it well. overall, shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening. shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up. so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact. shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch!

seeing this movie was the most fun i've had at the cinema in a long time. however, i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. this picture has everything any movie could ever have. it has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist self-conscious art film. it's all in there, adding up to a myth.the basic premise is about an indian couple, nandini (karishma kapoor) and shekhar (sanjay kapoor), happily living in canada, who rush to india to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report. the rest of the story takes place in india, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. at one point, the story borrows from "not without my baby," but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice.the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including shah rukh khan's dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie. in fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only shah rukh ends up being a real character. yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion. another notable presence is nana patekar, who plays narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar. nana patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character.the movie is not without its share of realism. violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions. at times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic.i have seen a share of bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. but "shakti" raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained. it is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. perhaps, the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but i came out of watching "shakti" exhilarated. making movies can be the most fun in the world!

okay, i know this does'nt project india in a good light. but the overall theme of the movie is not india, it's shakti. the power of a warlord, and the power of a mother. the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth. then things go terribly wrong. the interaction between nandini and her father in law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie. shah rukh khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor. it is easy to get caught up in the love, violence and redemption of lives in this film, and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax. the musical interludes are strengths, believable and well done.

well, i'll be honest: it is not exactly a sholay. but you cant get a sholay every week. in fact, you could see distinct signatures of "not without my daughter"(sally field, 1991) in this movie. however, as most "inspired" movies go, this one was a well-inspired one, well handled and well done. nana patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, but all others are commendable. specially so about dipti naval: saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her grace. in fact, she has performed much better that when i last saw her. another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age?all in all, a nice watch.

the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script. the film tells the story of an indian woman, nandini, who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja. all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to india. when they get into the village, nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; shekhar's family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. when she wants to leave, narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india. here starts the intense struggle which can be called "nandini vs. narasimha".india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct. the portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. the locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and krishna vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. one thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by ismail darbar, it is beautiful. the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.the film's biggest strength is the performances. karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini. her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. she displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. after fiza, this is her most powerful performance. one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen, nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha. he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. he is outstanding. another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india's most underrated actress, deepti naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief. anyway, do watch shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.

if any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills, this is probably the one. i've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way, but having a strong feeling. the movie was disturbing at moments. however, the movie was terrible at editing. the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place. like karisma is getting beat up, and the same time srk is fighting (comically) with the police officers. the ishq kamina song was very out of place. on top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning. the direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.i have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely. without them, this movie would not have an impact. karisma kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza. she looks pretty in the first half, and i've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her. what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date. nana patekar was excellent as her father-in-law. not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him. deepti naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene. though she doesn't have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good. the other good performance was the little kid. he was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes. the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances. sanjay kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do. shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina. the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song. and boy aish is mad hot. however, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever. people may have come to the movie for aish, but they won't brag too much about it after-wards. hum tum miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie. damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about. dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie. despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.

on sunday july 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called "stargate sg-1" was broadcast on showtime. a spin-off of and sequel to the 1994 film "stargate" starring kurt russell and james spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film. for ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg-1. originally, the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o'neill (two "l"s!), michael shanks as dr. daniel jackson, amanda tapping as captain samantha carter, christopher judge as teal'c and don s. davis as major general george s. hammond. for ten long years, we watched the team battle against the goa'uld, the replicators, the ori and many other aggressors. at the same time, they forged alliances with the asgard, the tok'ra, the rebel jaffa, the nox and the tollan. they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them. and sometimes not even then.as with all long-running series, they were numerous cast changes. michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor. daniel jackson's successor as the team's resident archaeologist/geek was jonas quinn, an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara, played by corin nemec. however, shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time. unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards. don s. davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go. the show's original star and arguably its most popular actor, richard dean anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons. his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons. he finally left "sg-1" in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six-year-old daughter. jack o'neill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason.the ninth season represented a new era for the programme. with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa'uld and the replicators in season eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high. regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa'uld as the series' main adversaries. three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re-invention. ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt. colonel cameron mitchell, the new leader of sg-1. his "farscape" co-star, the lovely claudia black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran, a former goa'uld host and con artist from another planet. a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season. rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry, the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o'neill and general hammond. for the last two years, they starred alongside the "sg-1" faithful (michael shanks, amanda tapping and christopher judge) and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise.alas, all good things must come to an end. during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its august 2006. after ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over. on march 13, 2007, what began with "children of the gods" ended with "unending". the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci-fi channel in the united states on june 22, 2007.in the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, "star trek", in terms of popularity in certain countries. it became the second-longest running sci-fi series in the world, second only to "doctor who" (1963-1989), and the longest-running american produced sci-fi series, having surpassed "the x-files" only a few months before it ended."stargate sg-1" represents the cornerstone of the "stargate" franchise. in 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spin-off series entitled "stargate atlantis", which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008. although plans for another feature film fell through, two direct-to-dvd films, "stargate: the ark of truth" and "stargate continuum", were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future. a third live-action series, "stargate universe", is also due to premiere at some point next year. (there was, unfortunately, an animated series, "stargate infinity", which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better). despite the end of "sg-1" and "atlantis" as continuing series, the future of "stargate" looks very bright indeed.in conclusion, while "stargate" has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci-fi television franchises such as "star trek" and "doctor who", its still relatively new compared to those two sci-fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.

uneven bollywood drama. karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend (sanjay kapoor), has a child, and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords. drama and tragedy ensue, and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller. film is compelling, its few song/dance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film's drama, at least once we've left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative, if ultimately misplaced as well. likewise, the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy-go-lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce, and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with. his throw-away comic-book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama. the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord, and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long-suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film's best scenes; ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay's sisters in india, and very pleasing eye candy. but sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious ad-libs. the directorial style of writer/director krishna wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good. the musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble (too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti's soundtrack cd, but bollywood hasn't yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums, at least not in most cases). but shakti is karisma kapoor's film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes. despite the unevenness of much of the picture, karisma's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures. in a strange way, also, i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i'd noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette, both of which i'd seen just prior, although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism-controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china's tang dynasty  whose self-serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.

this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as "mitchell in malta." at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit...not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger. mitchell being mitchell, the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either. oh well. at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst. i can't imagine watching it on it's own, however.

joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated. he's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him. baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. he really seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how cliché, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones, oliver reed and don stroud. it's what made the walking tall trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in final justice. this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. by moving the action from texas to europe, there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen. to be honest, i've always enjoyed the films of greydon clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s clint eastwood, and this is one of his best. final justice is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence. i suppose if they remake this with the rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do.

as a kid, i loved this game. i played it a zillion times during spring 1993 with my friend andrew. i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. then streets of rage 2 came out. and we quickly forgot that this one even existed.you play as ex-cops axel stone, adam or blaze fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. there are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x. beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. level 4 (the bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. you even have the chance to become mr. x's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). this leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr. x, but never mind.streets of rage also has truly fantastic music. the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis. the main theme, level one, level 4 and final boss are standout tunes. as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console. but with streets of rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.pros:average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.great tunes.easy to get into and hard to put down.cons:vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage 2.poor enemy ai. baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat. this is especially infuriating with the level 5 boss.lack of combo moves.lack of decent weapons.bad guy models are repeated far too often.graphics b- sound a- gameplay b- lasting appeal b-

"stargate sg-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg-1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.having seen this series sporadically for it's first few seasons when it first came out, i didn't know how good this series would really be, 10 years after i had last seen an episode. my old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "stargate sg-1" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. and why? because it runs on an amazing premise.this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time restriction of film. the sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show."stargate sg-1" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: - the first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul'd threat. - from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul'd and preventing attacks on earth. after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of goaul'd/replicator/ori conflicts- the 8th season is probably the most mixed one. it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. - the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o'neil. they are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than sg-1 and human/jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori.basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling i have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.in the end, because of the fact that i enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to find that it ends. the big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg-1.

all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done. it may not be up to par with what everyone expects, but look at it this way. would you expect perfection in hell? it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose. it was great to see her character transformation in this movie, considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get. i hope for a sequel very soon. if we want live action, i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori. i don't think lady death would transfer well to film. but be that as it may, it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong. no pun intended.

it's a very good movie, not only for the fans of lady death comics, but also for those who like animated movies/series of adventure and fantasy.the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn't done, but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell, lucifer himself.then she seeks revenge...and the rest you better see it from the movie.i liked the movie a lot, the characters are like the original comics, form chaos. i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics, only the last ones, after the passages in the movie, so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics, but...one way or another it's the story of lady death!

i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating's some people have given it. it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated, now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me. though, if you are a fan of interesting, strong characters and heroic(sexy) women kicking butt and saving the world(hell) you will love this movie. i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie. quite anime-esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation. like titan a.e. meet's the live action version of punisher. in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie.

i love the movies and own the comics, the comics are different then the movie but still i'd give it: 10 out of 10. it was awesome. if the movies got anymore awesome. i would have her babies. and i am female. read the comics you won't regret it. yes in this movie since brian p. the artist for her died we don't get nearly as good artistic work. i mean seriously don't get me wrong these people did great, but different versions for different people. different strokes for different folks as the saying goes. any guy who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane, or does not like women, or you know just plan insane. if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure, but hey there is always toes.

although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death.i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance.the animation was ok, i got the sense of the 80's anime from it which is what set it off for me. why everyone else hates that is beyond me.character development was fine. i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around. for you who don't like it, obviously wasn't paying attention. lucifer tells you how it happens, and she used his words.creamtor was a nice mentor/soldier for her. his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie.i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider. cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d

the first and second seasons started off shakily, with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones, and at times resorting to clichéd stories. but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it's characters more, it became a lot more fun and entertaining. the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men: richard dean anderson, peter deluise, joseph malozzie and paul mullie. richard's dry sense of humour makes to show so much better, peter's directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining, and joe & paul never fail to make a funny, interesting episode together. once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters, i doubt you won't like the show. for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes 'the other side', a good serious episode, and 'window of opportunity', a classic comic relief episode.

stargate is the best show ever. all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles. i love the connection between the characters. if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it. although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different. i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks. unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time (which is highly depressing). however this program is very very good and is a must see, but be warned it is highly addictive. so in summery i love stargate (and amanda tapping).

this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years. i will sadly miss it. although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit.the last ever episode of sg1(on television anyway)was beautifully done. robert wrote something that felt close to reality. as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show. (everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up's and downs. but over the years they've turned into a family). i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms.sg1 was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement. the wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. from episode one i was hooked. the blend of action, science, drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more.there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me. i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible.i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them. i never want the show to die.stargate sg1 - 1997 - 2007?

having seen most of ringo lam's films, i can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. it's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters. the action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is truely memorable. sadly, burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on, even if you near the second biggest china-town in north america (like i do). if you can find it, don't pass it up.

i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations...until now! burning paradise doesn't contain the flat humor most hk movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film. the story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some "intelligent" space (the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger, but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me). there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one(which is one of the coolest i have ever seen, yet so short) to the last main scenes! but mind, there's also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, decapitated, etc). the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical (notice: the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall!). yep, it's not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film, it's ringo lam! and i'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director! ace.

"burning paradise" is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo lam's urban cynicism. when one watches the film, they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. this great film has both!! always trying to be different than his contemporaries, lam gives us to traditional heroes(fong sai-yuk and hung shi-kwan)and puts them in a "raiders of the lost ark" setting. however, these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie. instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results. what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime, there is no holding back. too bad, they don't make films like this more often.

an unusual film from ringo lam and one that's strangely under-appreciated. the mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes. a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse. several horses get chopped up. it's very unexpected.the story is very simple, fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple. the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood. the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak. blood is everywhere. the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time. sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film. find this one, it's one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties. just remember it's not child friendly.

hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones. the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers. as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes. where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure. sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood.

this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong's 'new wave' that began with tsui hark's "zu: warriors of magic mountain". tsui set a tone for the new wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave (jackie chan, sammo hung, wong jing, ching siu tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. "burning paradise" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.it's not that there isn't humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. but this is just as humans are, not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time.when irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' of red lotus temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. he is the very incarnation of milton's satan from "paradise lost": "better to rule in hell than serve in heaven!" and if he can't get to satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.that's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: it's not that the abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. thus there's a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.of course, fortunately, the film doesn't end there. though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (if you want to know how, see the film!) yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all.

i haven't always been a fan, but the show grew on me. it wasn't until after season 5 that i started to see the richness of the show. they finally brought daniel jackson's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go,ould system lords were killed by rival lords, sg-1 or others.towards season 5, stargate sg-1, was beginning to become stale. with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise, the show became more and more solid.the characters had become stale as well. colonel jack o'neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o'neill's weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go'ould ra. the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in.amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter. she was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job. though this character had little area to grow, tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter's strengths. she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently. christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal'c. teal'c was an alien called the jaffa. infant go'ould, (snake like creatures) would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form. the jaffa would die. teal'c was the first prime of apophis' army. knowing that apophis was not a god like go'ould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy. finally, having had enough, he and jack o'neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people. after arriving on earth, he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the go'ould. christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character. teal'c is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra'tac. the show would not be complete without master bra'tac played by tony amandola. he is also a rock. in the end, he became adviser to most of sg-1, especially daniel jackson. don s. davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand. davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal. he does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. you can really say, he is the anchor of the base. simply, i would die for that man. if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world. he will go himself. he doesn't leave anyone behind.i saved dr. daniel jackson for last, because this character, i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on. in choosing shanks i don't think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson, they don't talk about spader, they talk about shanks. in the early years, the jackson character came off as a whiner. that's why i probably wasn't a fan. as the seasons pasted, the character became stronger. this gave him confidence. in the end, as of season 10, the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero. he still monitors the groups ethics. he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward. acheaology, history, culture and exploration are part of his very being. he is determined. though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement. other characters include, most recently: vala mal doran(claudia black) and colonel cameron mitchell(ben browder), new lead of sg-1. both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess. i see little difference between mitchell and crichton (farscape character). black's character is simply off the wall. definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon.

my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg-1 which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addicting. when the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! starting around season 5, the show took a different focus - still good, but different.the series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the "stargate". the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt.the episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own. what happens next was always unpredictable.the characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed. their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor. they are simply fun to watch.starting somewhere around season 5, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe (the goa'uld, then the ori). the plots become more complex (a lot more political/strategic oriented) and interdependent. the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature.one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. they are simply can't-miss shows. they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons.if you are a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll likely be hooked. if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to.

i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. richard dean anderson 2. amanda tapping. these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. the replacement of rda in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. this relationship carries over into the program we get to see.rda gives his 'o'neill' character believable personality. he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.there is a lot going on between 'carter' and 'o'neill' under the surface. they manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. the episode 'solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.'carter' and 'jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'o'neill'. yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. he understands what to do without having to think about the matter. the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.the quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show. he had his rare moments with claudia black, but that was all. amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. she was probably thinking more about the child than the show.the spin-off 'stargate atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. the villains (wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci-fi. the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. in the season 2 opener, 'daniel jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. the episode 'hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc, yet it is never mentioned again. this device could have been used in several later episodes on 'daniel', 'o'neill', and 'dr. frasier'.

i'm not great at writing reviews, so i'll just spout my opinions...i loved this series at first. the adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama... i thought it was all brilliant. anderson, tapping, shanks, judge, davis... i loved them all. davis, it seemed, was the fifth-most important person in the cast. not a big deal. but when his character (general hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and anderson's character (colonel o'neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. i don't know whether it's because hammond was more important that i realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****.the first seven seasons, though, were awesome. the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it, but it turned out to be, even if this wasn't the original intention, a brilliant setup to the series. i recommend that you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the tv series, then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around, believe me), and then watch the rest of the tv series.the last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven, but that doesn't mean they aren't good. it just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons.after you have finished this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, stargate: atlantis. it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.edit on 7-18-08: i just found out that don s. davis died a few weeks ago. it is a great loss.

i have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie, with a lot of potential, though the movie wasn't as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i don't remember one line from either of those movies, i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.though i didn't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects, were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today. i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn't for stargate, and my dad, who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6, and i'm glad he did, other wise i wouldn't have seen the brilliant shows like sg1, which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies, basically if a new sci fi series isn't better or as good as sg1, its not worth watching. basically this is the best sci fi show to date, and if you don't watch this, then you have no idea what you are missing!

i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10! the final episode of the 10th season "unending", where (it would certainly appear that) the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief! from the extremely rushed end of the series, it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season. my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd moves!unless the asgard return in a future sg-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends!poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.

when i read other comment,i decided to watch this movie...first, cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli; good enough...film,very intelligence and interesting because ,cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia...second,story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion...third,final chapter is not special or interesting,it's regular like other action movies...finally,i recommend to watch this movie...and i hope you'll love it enjoy :d

i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. if you look at the original star trek and star trek:tng, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. in many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. this was less the case with deep space 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other trek shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg-1. the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. sure, there were a few "throwaway" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.and speaking of funny, i loved that sg-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. in this way, i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5. jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.to truly appreciate sg-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. and, if you don't like sg-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably not the genre for you.

this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate. it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. such as, how was the stargate activated without a human computer? where did the goa'uld (ra's race) come from? how many are there? the first episode has a retired jack o'neill (spelled with 2 ls) recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis, a powerful goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman. we meet samantha carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now. we find out that daniel got married on abydos, and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial. then daniel's wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen. it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams, in which jack's team will be sg-1 which consists of jack, samantha and daniel. they go to chulak, a goa'uld homeworld to rescue daniel's wife and another one captured at abydos named ska'ra. they get captured, and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a jaffa named teal'c, first prime of apophis, saves them and goes to earth with them, where he is made part of sg-1. that was only the beginning of the adventure. in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa'uld called the tok'ra, in which samantha's dad becomes a member, the asgard, a cute little race in which we see thor most often (he's jack's buddy),and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.the show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons. in season nine, a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators, the ancients. season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, ben browder as cameron mitchell, the new leader of sg-1 and claudia black as vala maldoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. very well-produced, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack, this one has it all. a different way of travelling the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, this is one show you don't want to miss. unlock the gate and step through. you won't regret it!

as long as you go into this movie knowing that it's terrible: bad acting, bad "effects," bad story, bad... everything, then you'll love it. this is one of my favorite "goof on" movies; watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs!

china o'brien (1990) was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states. this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse. sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director. the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms. rothrock and richard norton. if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight-to-video action flick.china o'brien returns home to help out her dad. he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help. so she returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies?if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you. i only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director?recommended.

you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies, even the really bad ones? why? to see their heroes in action one more time. that's the way i feel about doc savage. i am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. there's a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the "camp" elements, etc.) but the spirit of doc is there, and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to. so, in my long-winded way, what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. and anyone who is a fan of superman, james bond, indiana jones, buckaroo banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.

it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression. it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace. a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball.likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema. the presence of a radio in just about everyone's house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world's events and provided many a drama and (especially) comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.the literature of the time also flourished at all levels. the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. but the comic book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. there were mediums that were ancestral to them. obviously,the newspaper comic strip was one parent, providing the visual/narrative method of story telling.the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine. the inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales. the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough's tarzan and johnston mcculley's zorro. the 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow, the avenger, g8's battle aces and the spider,master of men all found their way to the news stands, among many others.one other was doc savage, a full-blooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only "picture" of the hero. possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, doc was the prototype super hero.he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers. each of them was an expert in a given field. so we had a top rated: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, etc.the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's, and were published into the middle '50's. then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new "container", the paperback book. a fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.the re-introduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month (and for a while more). soon, there was a rumor of a doc savage movie! but when, by what producer? well, the venerable "man of bronze" was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together. it was veteran stop-action animator and producer of top special effects films, geoprge pal, who did the film along with warner brothers.when doc savage, man of bronze arrived in the movie houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely "no name" as far familiarity with the viewers. with former tarzan of tv,ron ely's nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming beauty of a starlette, pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler (as the villainous, captain seas); no other name would have been recognized. and, just maybe that was a plus in this case.the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going. use of narration, by paul frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.from the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured "camp" humor as the batman tv series. some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes. (for example, an experiment of doc's with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.) the whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little 'camp' every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. we are also puzzled about mr. george pal's being the producer(his last). he who had been so well known for special effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the pulp character's world.i can remember seeing it quite vividly. mrs. ryan (deanna) was in the hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, michelle(08/14/75). our older girl, jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward, it was straight over to the old marquette theatre, 63rd & kedzie, here in chicago.having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc, i was sort of let down by the final product. i could accept a little of this 'camp' business, but would not have objected if mr.pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp/comic/serial type excitement.and yet, the cast, headed-up by mr. ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable. the sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.and maybe that's just what they were trying for with this doc savage, man of bronze.

having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. upon this point i cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. however, what i can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun!ok..so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character? or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series?the point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm!former tarzan, ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman.best scene? far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  priceless!simply put, the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it. great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)

***possible spoilers***i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. ron ely is just right as doc. cool, calm, almost always in control(and with an occasional twinkle in his eye). what more can one ask for? i have never read a doc savage book, so i don't know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring-do. many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark, which i don't think is fair. the difference in budget is astounding(raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has. special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right. the sousa music is catchy(love that theme song- every time i watch the film, i end up humming the theme for days).the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy. highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas. not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib (really!). overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. i give it 7 out of 10.doc savage, doc savage...thank the lord he's here!

most people miss hollywood's point of concept. if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, within the confines of the law then i, approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage.in all times of conflict or war, the public and government look for heroes to decorate. the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as doc savage, james bond, superman, batman, spiderman and others. doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before james bond, superman or any of the others. all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character, not the 'man of bronze'.

the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as "camp" (i.e., the 60's batman show) for tv and movie. thus you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), a cluelessly unromantic doc savage (he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot), monk mayfair in a nightsheet (a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights), and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute. and when they're not doing booming sousa march scores, the tinkly little "funny" music undercuts much of the drama.even as such, this movie is...okay. it's fun, and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. except for monk, as has been mentioned before: he's hugely muscled, not obese. and long tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not paul gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf.the green death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something i'd recommend for children. but they are very close to the feel of the pulps. when the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right - i'll give them that.but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, reeves' first two superman movies, think what we might have had then. i think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic. there's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage, but they're also trying to give in to the "heroes must be camp" attitude that batman created. one gets the impression there was a sober, pulp-style first draft and then someone came in and said, "hey, let's make it funny - it worked with the batman show 8 years ago!"but doc lives on, thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai. if macrauch ain't doing a homage to doc savage in that movie, the man is truly demented. so when the series actually gets on tv (allegedly mid-season in '99-00), doc savage, updated to the 90's, will live once more.

this is a very entertaining movie. a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort at serious drama. it was not made that way....it is an extremely enjoyable film, performed in a tongue in cheek manner. all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us. the fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous. the so-called "green death", utilized on a couple of occasions, is not, as i read in one review, "gruesome". a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film. hey, lighten up... again, i remind one and all that this is a fun film. each phase of this "fight" was captioned, which added to the fun aspect. the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan. this is not one of those martial arts films. ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc. another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the "bad guy" (seas) is dealt with. i promise you that if you don't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner.

outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "raiders of the lost ark", only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson. the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating batman by two decades. starring ron ely (tarzan) as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of hidalgo. best line, our hero to mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "mona, you're a brick!"paul wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, captain seas is a an absolute delight. expect a little "raiders..", a dash of "batman", a little "the lost world", a little "lost horizons" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa's patriotic music. a prime candidate for dvd release, it is certainly overdue. an unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10

i was brought up on doc savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, i found it thoroughly entertaining.i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are. "i don't know what it is about the doc, but he always gets the girls" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over austin powers. ron ely is a god.it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk. i don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like i said it's a classic,it cannot be done without ron.(like the italian job without mini's and michael caine). i give it 10/10.

we so often talk of cinema landmarks - kane, the godfather, a bout de souffle. one film however is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. i am talking of course about the classic doc savage (m.o.b.)this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism. not to mention kung-fu.it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history (until of course queen's breathtaking work on flash gordon). although a bit of a rarity, this film is well worth seeking out - it will repay the effort of your search ten-fold.

roll is a wonderful little film. toby malone plays an 18 year old kid (very well acted, by the way) who is into soccer. malone's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops, and some prostitutes ... and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law, what the contents of either gym bag is, and even what gender a key biker is. parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels.for me, roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll. those opinions are: 1. i really want to visit australia one day. the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation.2. some of the best filmmakers in the are australian. the cinematography in roll was especially impressive. i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes.3. australian women are hot!

mat spirogolou's (toby malone) family know he is a talented footballer, and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club. they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him.but the cousins are like chalk and cheese: one a naive farm boy, the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters. mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day.having missed his cousin george (damien robertson) on arrival in the city, mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one.toby malone, probably better known for his work in theatre, puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager. there are telltale signs of a low budget, but as with so many other low-budget movies there's more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm, than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster.

i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of roll.roll is about a country boy, mat (toby malone) who has dreams of becoming a sports star. mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george (damien robertson). well, that was the plan anyway. george is involved with a gangster, tiny (john batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. needless to say, mat gets dragged into george's world. i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.every character in the movie complimented each other very well, the two cops were great. david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters 'pando' from two hands.one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for 20 years, perth and fremantle. it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with, especially the old ferris wheel.this rocks 'n' rolls

a country-boy aussie-rules player (mat) goes to the city the night before an all-important afl trial match, where he is to be picked up by his cousin. and then things go wrong.his no-hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark / drug-dealer tiny (who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian). needless to say, mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos, and it isn't long before thoughts of tomorrow's match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night's frantic events unravel.accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy mat, and successfully plays a part well below his age. best support comes from john batchelor as tiny, and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events. roll is fast-paced, often funny, and a very worthwhile use of an hour.

i've just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be. toby malone's performance really stood out, i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film, which itself is a lot of fun, very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters, quite an achievement considering it's short running time. there are plenty of good twists throughout as well, it will keep you guessing until the end. other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse. it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off, you could do a lot worse than checking this out, you won't regret it. good fun. 7/10

a film i expected very little from, and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be. roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good', it is funny throughout, the characters are endearing and the pace is just right.toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt, said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams. he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny. watch out for these two.highly recommended.

this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. i loved the character of matt, and also tiny. they seemed the most engaging and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. matt is very good (as is his no good cousin), and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy. i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor, eric bana. my personal favourite part was the brothel scene, loved that. overall, i liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating. the penalty however, i was disappointed in. it was a side foot curl, rather than the appropriate laces blast.i am of course kidding. :)

plato's run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to.gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer (scarface) and action star jeff speaksman (the expert). what i liked about plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato's sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10

it's been a while since i've watched this movie, and the series, but now i'm refreshing my memory! this was a very funny movie based on the classic series! johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together. bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee. when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm, bo and luke sneak around hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal. they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip-mine hazzard county, unless the dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, daisy. my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg, and sheriff rosco p. coltrane was way too serious. other than that, i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard!!!

what is wrong with you people, if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head. of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. it was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. the movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. all in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd. people, enjoy it for what it is.

having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised. reality check: the original series wasn't that good. i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted. the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment. it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.back to the movie. if you watch this film in it's own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series, then it's not bad at all. the real star is of course the general lee. the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d.o.h. is all about. johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb-and-dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved. the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy, burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m.c. gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p. coltrane, the way he always should have been.if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect. otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind.

i'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show. and i really enjoyed this flick. i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters.it's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's much cruder than the show." does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode? daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.and as far as the plot goes. it was the perfect dukes plot. in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen.while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren't exactly like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. i wasn't too keen on burt's boss hogg though. and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe. in the movie roscoe is a little... scary.and who didn't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard?folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't be sorry. it's just a great dumb movie!

this movie had an interesting cast, it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job. im glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot. i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation. this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future.

for all of you that don't speak swedish: the swedish [original] title of this film; "rånarna" translates into something in the line of "the robbers". this fact is the main problem i have with the film, cause it's not really about the robbers at all. it's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies. a regular desk job one would think, but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers... exactly: we've seen this before. the fact that there's a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn't really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the film.what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it's masterfully executed in all ways, that the actors are as great as they are and don't overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story.one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it's music sets the right mood when it's needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car-chases spread throughout the film. a nice touch! the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he's not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background, but that's something you have to neglect.all in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you. 7/10

it's a bit easy. that's about it.the graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games. the sounds are magnificant. everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic.the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like banjo-kazooie and donkey kong 64.i got this game as a christmas present in 1997, and since then, i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.

mario's first foray into the world of 3-dimensions is incredible. miyamoto's masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it's charm today. this game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3d adventure/platform games.

gotta start with ed furlong on this one. you gotta. god bless this kid. $5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life. he has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script. you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like furlong is even acting. maybe that's why his performance was good. same with madsen. you keep thinking, "i bet this guy is really like this in real life." does madsen even have to act? just natural. vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted mummy guy. i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance. her reactions are spot-on in this film. i battled if she was hot or not, but realized i would just like to see more of her. not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films. but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing. it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank, they kill hostages, and the good guys win in the end type of film. the twists keep on coming...and coming.the café scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it's really like in there. not glossed over a bit. think like bourne ultimatum "lite" style on some scenes in the café.and for those bo bice fanatics out there - actor curtis wayne (who plays karl) will make you do a double take. these guys are twins.as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town. made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents. but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of. and some of them are smoking hot. moncia dean? need i say more.

although super mario 64 isn't like the rest of the games in the series, it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games. games with this much replay value are few and far between. plus, this game has so much variety. there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do, and many other hidden tasks. the game isn't very challenging, but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all. once you beat it, you'll want to erase your game and start again. and its just as much fun the second time, or third time, or two hundredth time. a must own for any nintendo 64 owner, and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64.

super mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break. i've beaten the game 4 times, but i've never gotten all 120 stars...(i've gotten 111)...but i hope to achieve them eventually. even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in, i loved watching my sisters play it. now i am 13 and still play this, erasing games and starting over again.the graphics are unbelievable for an early n64 game. the gameplay is addictive. the controls are great. the levels are tough, but not impossible. the bowser fights are challenging.i would like to tell you more, but why don't you just get it for yourself? put the x-box 360, ps3, and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.

one of the funnest mario's i've ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls, and good graphics for its time. there's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still, need to get more accomplished to fight a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera angle; though it works fairly well most of the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if your a big time mario fan; this ones for you. even if your not a huge fan of him, i'd still recommend this one. its a big game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing in short bursts of time. it will almost certainly hold your interest; it sure does hold mine!

when i first got my n64 when i was five or six,i fell in love with it,and my first game was super mario 64.and i loved it!the graphics were great for it's time,a good plot,great courses and above all,the best music i heard in a nintendo game.i don't remember the plot completely,but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser,and mario has to rescue her.the object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle.each had about five or six challnges to get the stars.there are secert parts of the castle,where you can get more stars.but of course,you have beat bowser.*i think there are three levels to beat bowser on* lets start with the characters.mario is the main character,and gets helpful advice from toad,so he is basically one of your only alliances.i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end.the main villain is bowser,and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba.the characters are really great.next,how about the graphics?people say gameplay is more important then the graphics,and i agree completely.but with he great plot,there are great graphics.especially for it's time.i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like 007 and their graphics don't compare to super mario.bright colors,great effects and awesome sound effects.i found the graphics in the water courses very very good.next to the bowser world ones,it has the best graphics in the game.now,the music.this is my favorite part of the game.growing up,when i played this at a young age,i'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep.especially the music from jolly roger bay,which was peaceful and wonderful.there are others that are great too,especially in,once again,the worlds with bowser,are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites.this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer,and i love it.this game gets 10/10 or *****(5)/*****(5) go play the game!

or at least one of the best. i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64. bowser is up to his usual shenanigans (yeah it's a dumb word but the only one i can think of) and mario must stop him again. this game is very fun to play, and contains lots of nostalgia to me. the only bad thing about it is the graphics, which are awful to today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the little mini-games you can unlock) it's the second best n64 game (the first best is conker's bad fur day) that i recommend to any mario fan, or any fan of platform games. it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day.9/10 or: a

yes, that's right, it is. i firmly believe that the n64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made. it was amazing the first time i saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its amazing now. the play control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there. a must have for any n64 owner, and a reason to get an n64 for everyone else.

rated e i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times.in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day, super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system.i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time.if you have an n64 and don't have this game you should try to find it.the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment.the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game.you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer.now you can do it in a 3d environment.super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it.10/10

this game is amazing. really, you should get it if you don't have it. although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out. i believe that this game will always be a classic. it's just as good a super mario world or so. when i was young, my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did. it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy, but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential. it's fun entertaining and challenging. everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well it did come out in 1996.) rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi!!! nintendo is the best!

mario is invited to princess peach's castle for cake. when mario gets there, he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her! mario must save the day again. unlike the 2-d games, mario can explore anything he wants to. he can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-ups, find secrets in levels, and more. you can spend four hours in one level. no time limits. there are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage. to get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. you enter the world by going through a painting. there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, i don't see how anyone could dislike this game. it's great. this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n64 would have a good life. every 3d plat-form game we know of has something in common with sm64. banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used. super mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3d games. 10 out of 10. if you have an n64, buy this game. it's hard to find used, because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. a perfect 10.

if you want mindless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of seattle, then this is the show for you!the concept of dark angel isn't anything new (in fact, there's controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book), but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish.jessica alba is smoking and max' friends (original cindy, kendra) are just as hot. the fight scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better (the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it).in my opinion, dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for, but if you're looking for hard hitting, award-winning drama, go watch "the west wing" or something.

all i have to say is if you don't like it then there is something wrong with you. plus jessica is just all kinds of hot!!!!! the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell. that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen.

how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me. i loved this show before i even saw it. for 3 reasons, 1. the story intrigued me, 2. jessica alba and 3. james cameron! please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it's bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on dvd and then join the campaign to get season 3 made!i hate fox and i'm sure a lot of you "dark angel" fans hate them too. they have a thing for canning good shows! don't you all agree?

i thought this had the right blend of character, plot, futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board. it will take a while to get going, but the acting was good and i was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at. i like the attitude too! certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories.

this is the best sci-fi that i have seen in my 29 years of watching sci-fi. i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite. the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today.

i enjoyed longstreet, which followed in the steps of raymond burr's successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition. but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided--i believe wrongly--that longstreet was not able to compete with mr. burr's ironside.i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable. i hope that a box set of longstreet will appear.writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv.

i love this show, it's sure to be a winner. jessica alba does a great job, it's about time we have a kick-ass girl who's not the cutesy type. the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots. everything is layed out well, and thought over. to put it together must have taken a while, because it wasn't someone in a hurry that just slapped something together. it's a great show altogether.

this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn't find an audience.the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story. and who could forget pax, the beautiful guide dog in the series!whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series, the settings , in new orleans, the acting and the music (i note the comment about the music score in other comments ...i remember that clearly) all work to make a good television series even better!well you never know ...one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd!

dark angel is a cross between huxley's brave new world and percy's love in the ruins--portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by "the pulse," it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters--max (the dark angel/bike messenger) and logan (the rich rebel). it seems uneven, perhaps a result of a variety of authors, but is held together by the energetic, beautiful, and charming jessica alba, who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive. i think that fox has done it again.

all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing. the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis. the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do. the main actors and actresses i.e. jessica alba michael weatherly etc. make you forget you are watching a fictional t.v. show they seem to make this show come alive. all in all this is the best show i have ever watched

i think this show is definitely the greatest show. jessica alba does such a great job in it. michael weatherly also does an awesome job, as well as the rest of the cast. the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing. it's like watching a 1-hour movie. it's definitely worth watching.

this is an absolute great show. jessica alba, besides being the most beautiful women in the world, is a great actress. she does a great job of portraying max, and i could never see anyone else doing that role. she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous.

dolph lundgren is back! detention marks dolphs first film in nearly 2 years, and that is following the delayed hidden agenda. this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips, agent red and stormcatcher. however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda, which was better in almost every respect. what this film does have in it's favour from dolph's previous outing, is a sense of cheesy fun. the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role, and it's good to see dolph doing his own stunts again.the films story is ludicrous and prime b-movie material. an ex-military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching, whilst taking a detention class, he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal. the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches. if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy. thankfully the filmmakers don't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability, this film has a so bad it's enjoyable kind of vibe.where the film is let down is miss-using a fairly decent budget. the budget of around 10 million has not been well spent. it's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination. the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse. there are some good moments. you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning, with plenty of destruction. the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen. as for the cast. hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages. there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film. this however has problems. the actors are on the most part bad. the bad guys are terrible, but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness. the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters. they all hate authority, each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons, but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability. this movie is all about dolph though. while this film is nowhere near his best, it is nowhere near his worst. it also marks a turning point in his career. he is now back in good shape, and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action. dolph looks enthusiastic here, he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man (running from explosions in slow-mo, one liners, and handling large weapons) again in a movie like his older ones, albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one. it is good to see dolph looking energised. his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary, and using doubles a lot (he still does all the fights himself though) but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it.overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode. there's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm. **

i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season3 although season2 was not as good as season1 which is excellent indeed!!!i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon.(failed! :_(i am a chinese student and it's inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and $).i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow!

this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren, however alex karzis is awful as the villain!. the story is very good, and i found the kids to be likable for the most part, plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this!. the action scenes are excellent, and it's almost like die hard except it's set in a school!, plus kata dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick!. the finale is very exciting, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, however i just wished it had another villain, because alex karzis just didn't cut it as the villain way too ott, and laughable for my tastes. this should be higher then 4.1 in my opinion, as i thought it was a great action film, and while the kids, were very stupid at times, they got quite resourceful as the movie went along!, plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well!. the ending is very amusing,and corey sevier's character was my favorite student!, plus dolph has still got it!. this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from lundgren!, but alex karzis is awful as the villain, still i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. sidney j. furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. there is a bit of blood and violence. we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,knife in the side of the head, bloody arrow hits, an impaling, and other minor stuff. the acting is fantastic!. dolph lundgren is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass as usual, had great chemistry with the kids, had an awesome character, is very charismatic, and he may not have shown a great emotional rage, he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors! (lundgren rules!!!!!). alex karzis is god awful as the villain, he is laughably ott, was boring, and not menacing at all, he also annoyed the crap out of me. kata dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do, she was the real villain in my opinion!. corey sevier is funny as mick, he was my favorite student, and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half, i liked him a lot!, he had good chemistry with dolph too. dov tiefenbach(willy),chris collins(hogie),mpho koaho(jay tee),danielle hampton(alicia),nicole dicker(charlee) all do great as the students. jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiancée. rest of the cast do fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick, it isn't going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie. our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day. sure the script isn't going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action. dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes, and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well. all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick, but youv'e seen it a million times before.

i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw. it was a cool fun movie.dolph looked superbly cool on the bike.he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies.he is now in a pretty good shape.the story was ok and the other actors were also passable.i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie.but it also had its share of problems. the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target.they should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way. another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing. i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers. there should've been more bad guys. last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget. overall the movie was a good movie.i enjoyed it.i would recommend others to watch it. p.s. now u r a dead beat cop. (some one-liners were also cool)

dark angel is a futuristic sci-fi series, set in post-apocalyptic seattle, centering on max (jessica alba), a genetically enhanced young woman, on the run from her creators.the dark angel universe is absorbing, (not as much as say buffy, but absorbing nonetheless) with an interesting and believable set of characters. certainly, it is not for everyone, but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there. dark angel is criminally overlooked, and under-rated, and was unfortunatly canceled after only 2 series. which was a great shame, as this had the potential to become a great series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running bbc sci-fi comedy red dwarf. as it is dark angel remains unfinished, so seek it out, and if you want more, lobby fox to make another series.

this show is so full of action, and everything needed to make an awsome show.. but best of all... it actually has a plot (unlike some of those new reality shows...). it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base.. i totally suggest bying the dvds, i've already preordered them... i suggest you do to...

like a lot of series pilots, dark angel's opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet. not that this is unusual in any way, but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more. in today's world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation, the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused, with all guns blazing.the ninety-minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together, and both episodes have a problem with focus. in the first half, we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her. we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets, interacting with a pi, or sorting out co-workers' domestic problems. the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise.it's when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus. throughout the two halves, max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time. in the second half, the repercussions catch up with him, and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess. this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series, and it works, but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning. it's like most of the pieces are there, but a couple that make a complete image have been left out. perhaps they get filled in with later episodes, but that's beside the point. the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty-eight less minutes.the last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing. original cindy in particular is an annoyance, and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes. while the acting isn't as bad as daytime soap, it isn't of such quality that i'd commend it. jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world, but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least.the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top-notch. in fact, this series was considered quite expensive to produce, and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn't last a whole season. especially when there was ample time for both shows - they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv. the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel, where imagination rather than overhype, are used to draw the attention.in all, i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten. it never rises above the level of throwaway television, and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time. but the potential is there, and that's often all that matters where pilots are concerned.

i think dark angel is great! first season was excellent, and had a good plot. with max(jessica alba) as an escaped x-5, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still "saving the world". and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice.the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first. the plot kinda disappeared, and the series lost a little of it's charm, mostly because of all the weird "creatures" appearing. don't get me wrong the second season is good, but with a little bit to much of the "manticores". however, they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2, in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of.so i really wish they could start making new episodes. and with james cameron behind this it can't go wrong. so as a conclusion i would say it's a great series, however i'm still hoping for a third season!

i bought dark angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5. nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly (also and amazing show). i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see designate this, bag 'em, the berrisford agenda, harbor lights, freak nation etc.) and alec is great. i've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and i have to say, i can't believe it was cancelled - i won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). as proof of my obsessiveness, max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks i've had it, i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. it's just too good.

jessica alba's max and valerie rae miller's original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial. wonderfully politically incorrect. quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but generally the standard is high and when it is not, jessica is always worth looking at. valerie's urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory.

definitely needed a little work in season 2. such as the virus between max and logan, and ames white along with his ancient, super cult. during season two, however, the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max. very good drama in season two. but of course like all tv shows, if there's something a little wrong with it, the broadcasting company takes it off the air. i was seriously hoping for a third and final season. season 2 leaves you hanging, unless you read the books by max allan collins, then you will know what happens.dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again. since jessica alba's carrier sky rocketed after the show. if that would be the case, then there should be a movie to complete it. just like the show firefly, which of course fox canceled as well.

i would like to comment the series as a great effort. the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well, especially in season 1. season 2 however became more of a freak show, and lost da's original charm. season one story line was more interesting, a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x-series. i was looking forward to new seasons, in fact i still am. i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback. even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled, da can make it big if worked on properly, and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge.

it took us a couple of episodes to "get into" dark angel as a story and a series, since we were transitioning from the sopranos, a very different mentality framework. but, once we got with the gist of the series, we were very quickly hooked. it's a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category: dark angelwas much more than your average tv series. it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes, but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to "mutants" reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face (and make) everyday. that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces (hence not ruining the "fun" for those who don't like to be lectured during entertainment), but every event and human/societal interaction remains relevant to the present. we all make judgments, face our own prejudices, but, in the end, the question of who you are lies in: do you sit back and shut your mind to it, or do you get up and do something about it? for those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series empowers them. for those who've never had to face the question, this series "sneaks in" that message under the guise of pure action entertainment. it is much more well-made and well-written than most tv series; i'm highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear.

dark angel rocks! the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off! me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode! takes like 4 days but it is worth it! it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me!

i miss dark angel!..i understand not ever one likes it, but as far as i'm concerned the show should not have been canceled, especially for another space show mock up...i'm reading the books now. they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings, but i still think we should get a tv movie or something.the freak nation lives!!!!!!!!

it's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr. the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome! the guy is cute too so it's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls.

yowsa! if you really want some action, check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller! veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism... but director dean hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy-swimsuit scenes, jiggly beach jogs, hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like! want action? you'll get more of it here than in pearl harbor. want babes? you'll get an eyeful every two minutes. want more? go out and buy this video! yowsa, yowsa, yowsa! that's some mighty spicy meatballs!!!

a thin story with many fine shots. eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d.r.e.a.m. team. and, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanying them. traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business-couple intending to poison the world with antrax. original in this movie is the bra-bomb, put on a captured member of the d.r.e.a.m.-team. of course she is rescued by a co-member, three seconds before explosion. although clearly lent from james bond's 'goldfinger' and 'you only live twice', such a climax always works well. all in all a nice watch, james bond replaced here by three charlie's angels.

now this show looks like most of the other shows of it's type from the mid-90's, but the only thing is about this one is that it's different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too. i personally thought it was a good show, i can't understand why would they cancel it. the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date.my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie, which i know is gonna be impossible to do, but hey it doesn't hurt to dream, doesn't it?anyway, i would recommend if you hadn't seen it to find the dvd of all 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great.

a classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny. it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters. road rovers is a show worth seeing, it is a short 13 episodes, and if you can ever manage a chance to see it, you should. unfortunately, it is very hard to find. i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all 13 episodes. i would definitely buy it if they did, and if they do, you should buy it too. if you have kids who like dogs, they will love road rovers! road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was.

far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did, after animaniacs. even if the ratings were low, so what, i still enjoyed it and loved it, was so funny and i adored the cast, wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic, the whole cast were brilliant, especially the legendary frank welker.i'd love to see this cartoon again, was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant. also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental, that was just fantastic, i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back, i loved them

the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world. the show was hilarious to say the least. simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages. running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game. the action was mesmerizing, and cleverly set up. the characters were very original, each with a very different personality. but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters. each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but implied in subtext. hopefully, one day, there'll be some way to watch the rovers in action again.

michael stearns plays mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that's when he loses it. he believes that when women actually have sex that's when they lose any sense of "innocence" and/or "beauty". so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance, ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scope.the seeming primary reason for this movie's existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again. the "story" comes off as more of an afterthought. this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we're treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity (the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes) and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation. of course, seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism. (for one thing, mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger.) this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack.those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another. it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain *how* to react. it unfolds at a very slow pace, but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist. it's a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen.7/10

this incredibly formulaic flick from the "walker, texas ranger" squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie. in addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. however, it's a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. that's all it was meant to do and it does so. the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad. the acting is also decent, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal. if you're a fan of the genre (and of "walker, texas ranger"), you will definitely love this. if not, then don't waste your time. 8/10

a true hero of modern times , chuck norris has left tv "walker , rexas ranger ", and is looking new steps for his artistic career. the president´s man is the second movie of a future tv series , with norris in the title role, and with young actors like jennifer tung or judson mills ( one of the young rangers of "walker " ) . the old master teachs to young aspirant . it´s one of the most powerful themes of "the president´s man ". in this tima, "a line in the sand " has reached world surprise for his tratment of terrorism in usa , months before the tragic september 11. eric norris, son of chuck is the director . the movie is amusing, a good action work , plenty of fights and heroism . chuck norris have many plans for the future . bells of innocence , his next picture, will be the following.

good show, very entertaining. good marshal arts acting. good story plot. the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich, to chuck, norris, jennifer tung, and especially a big hand to judson mills. an especially fine tribute to robert urich, in his latter days. a great ! actor who will be truly missed.

there are a few spoilers in this comment!!contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex4u and a few others, i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series.i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little, the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired.the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed. i do fail to see how that many "professionals" weren't able to hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and deke, being the hero, had to survive.as for the comment about needing to "get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs." this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the u.s.if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it, maybe they would have realized the plot of the story: rashid, a bin laden like character, planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states. the president's man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem.perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it.

i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film. although the acting may not be superb, the fight scenes are fantastic. i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him. in my opinion, the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production! i hope you take the time to view this movie!

ooverall, the movie was fairly good, a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes, but chuck norris did hardly anything, except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. the movie was very similar to the events of sept. 11, with a bin laden-like terrorist sending a video to the president (urich) and threatening to detonate it. judson mills had some superb action roles, taking out rashid's compound and various kick-butt roles but, there was a lack of chuck norris. judson took over most of the action, leaving joshua (chuck) with que on her computer. but, overall, it was realistic and didn't lack the action, but only did it on mr. norris' part. i gave the film 7/10.

if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris & judson mills then this is the movie to see.it has a lot of adventure in it.it is a great follow up to president's man.the chemistry between the main three stars(chuck norris,judson mills,jennifer tung)is incredible.my personal opinion.this movie along with the original,has turned out so well,that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series.if you've seen president's man,i recommend this movie for you.if you've seen president's man:a line in the sand but you haven't seen president's man,then let me suggest that you do.you will not be disappointed with either one.

japanese tomo akiyama's keko mask (1993) is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch! there are also some sequels, but i haven't seen them since these films are hyper rare. some kind of re-releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films. the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline, which is, according to the teachers, the most important thing in education. the school is lead by incredibly funny looking (just look at the costume!) human wizard/whatever, who is like principal in the school, and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed. well, the main thing about the film is its name, keko mask, who is some beautiful and masked fairy, who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers! yes, this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background. the most important thing is, of course, that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked! her identity is never revealed in these films, and also the credits say "keko mask: unknown" while the actor names are listed!the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies. she has a gorgeous, but lethal vagina! yes, you read right. she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them, spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view, after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs! the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like: "i've never seen such a beautiful vagina" and "now i can die in peace." this film is totally fantastic!!there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films (japanese censors optically fog/blur all the pubic hair in any film) and also about some restrictions among school students (like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc.) there's one great scene in which one nerd sees girl's bare you-know-what for the first time, and says "hey there's no fog in it!" i couldn't help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this. also, one character says in the end that he will return, if japan films allows to make the sequel. i'm glad it allowed as i've heard the sequels are equally outrageous. one sequel should include blues brothers (yes, those blues brothers!) in it etc.this is trash in its most enjoyable, funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find. this would definitely be even greater experience, if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point, but fortunately those segments are very few. this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don't mention here and it wouldn't be even necessary to tell them all here. if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek, i think you'll love this little gem as i do, and the director is definitely a genius in this field! 8/10 perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal?

i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region 3 dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it. a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan.the story is pretty straight forward, and has been mentioned already so i won't go into it again. needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for, and they do not disappoint. only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed. bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time! all kicks and punches come with the all important "type writer" clicks and air "whooshes", which is a cool effect though quite amusing!i give this movie a b+. good but not great. in a way i feel it could have been that bit better. golden swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had as good a story and better action.

the five deadly venoms is easily the most memorable k.f. flick from the shaw brothers' stable (exc. maybe master killer). it has the artists who came to be known as simply "the venoms", some of the best fight choreography ever, and, surprisingly for a kung fu movie, a great plot! one of my all-time favorites!!!

five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas, but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences in hong kong film history. director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece. this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms. meng lo plays yet another bad ass. he would go on to be in super ninjas. kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled. any chop socky fan can apperciate this. but i still think it ain't as good as super ninjas (also made by chang cheh). but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best.

i recall seeing this movie as a kid. i don't recall where i saw it. i must have been around 14 years old. i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again. it came on the kung fu channel once, but i missed it. i was really bummed. it is the best special-effects kung fu movie that i've seen to date! i highly recommend it, and now that i've discovered where to get it, i can enjoy it once more and for years to come. i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly.

after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin (i bought it on dvd, hence the "spin" pun...i'm a dork). the beginning was everything i hoped for, a perfect set-up (along with some quotes that i've heard on various wu-tang albums) to what should have been a good movie. but the plot i heard was so great, was so predictable. every time i saw a character (except for the lizard) i guessed which venom he was. plus, the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie. ok, so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung-fu right? wrong. the fights were very short and few and far between. granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer. i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened. i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened. i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened. in short, not much happens. the fighting is all pretty routine. don't be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's a good one.

when i was very young,on a local tv station,they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays.i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends.i remember lots of them.i saw great flicks like crippled masters,blind fist of bruce,kung fu zombie,shaolin drunken monk,rage of the master,tattoe dragon,and...five deadly venoms.i remember the day clearly.me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king.we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday.we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch,turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it.then under that was the title of the film.it said five deadly venoms.then the movie began.i bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence.i loved this movie the minute it came on.my favorite character was the toad venom.the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what lured me...it was the fighting.the fights were so...amazing.i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended.

this movie is really good. the plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle. fighting scenes are very good. there's a lot of different combat styles (although one of styles was a bit unreal for me, but it's only my opinion) to watch and it's fascinating show. the only thing which may be irritating is actors look. a bit too effeminate (at least for me). hong kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, so "five venoms" (or other its versions) is great choice.

i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid, and i thought it was so cool! now i am 26 years old, and my friend has it on dvd!!!we got a case of brew, and watched this classic! it lost none of it's original kung fu coolness! if you are a fan of kung fu/karate movies, this is a must see... the dvd is available. i believe this movie is also called "pick your poison".watch it soon!

i really like this movie. i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it. i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie.the story is very interesting. it introduces us to 6 characters; each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly. each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other. the dying master sends the 6th venom, his last student, to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed.how will the last pupil find the other venoms? how will he know which of them is bad? the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great.we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination. it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other.if you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. it doesn't get any better than this.

if you love kung-fu films and you haven't seen this movie, you are cheating yourself. this movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film. normally, it takes a die-hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films, but this one has it all! the story is well told, and complete. the fight scenes are great, and tend to end before you're completely bored with them (unlike crouching tiger). throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie. see this one at all costs. heck, my wife even enjoyed it.wu du it!9 out of 10

this is one of my favourite kung-fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late 70's. the plot is interesting and twisty, the characters are cool each with their own style - toad, snake, lizard etc. the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh / venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on display from the various characters. i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang cheh's films are the same, most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts. this film is breath of fresh air in comparison.

a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan.he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good. the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake, centipede, scorpion, lizard, toad, while the last student was taught a little in each style. all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money,and soon everyone is battling to get the money.classic martial arts film has title that even many non-fans know. i've spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head. its a very good movie, though i'm not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio (one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example). this isn't to sell the film short, its not, since the film is structured like a mystery, our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is. we're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is. the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film, other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money, there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes. its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention. (the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i've ever seen where there are no women. i don't think one has a speaking role and i'm pretty sure that none appear in the background. its indicative of nothing, its just something that struck me.) this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles, but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch.around 7 out of 10.

one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema (or, indeed, most anything done outside these holier-than-thou united states) are the permutations that crop up. in post-world war two japanese manga (comics), for instance, are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects, many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion. the same thing happens in genre film-making, as well; though, again, i'm referring to movies made outside the u.$. (where we're just too "sophisticated" in our close-mindedness to appreciate anything that isn't about or by us). would an american company, for instance, back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler (el santo) or a werewolf (paul naschy) or a real-life martial artist (bruce lee)...? as for television: forget it. while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine, i've always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was- how to put it kindly- a bit lacking. to this very day, there hasn't been a pay-per-view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia. (there are lots of soft-core porn masquerading as entertainment shows, but the so-called action channel, for instance, has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries.) before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc, there was, of all things, at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery: the 5 deadly venoms. in its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit (western, cop show, etc.), this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work. it's now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent, thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve. if you're a martial arts movie fan, rejoice: one of the greatest movie genres of all time (specifically, the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s) are getting a long-overdue second life (and greatly appreciated second look) on dvd.

"in the world of old-school kung fu movies, where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen, it took a lot for a film to stand out -- and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years. what is arguably chang cheh's finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry, from the themes of loyalty, brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo (who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang) during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's, to more modern movies like a man called hero, which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film. the influence has also carried into other areas as well, from music such as the wu-tang clan, tv commercials for sprite and video games such as "mortal kombat." so what makes this movie so special? the plot -- on the surface -- is pretty simple. it deals with members of a rogue group known as the "poison clan" who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu. all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities, denoted by their animal styles, or "venoms" (the lizard can climb walls, the scorpion has a deadly strike, etc.). the twist is that since the clan always wears masks, not all of them known who the others are. thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller. we're not talking the usual suspects here, but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time. supposedly, golden harvest was not too happy with chang's script -- like most of his movies, they felt it was too dark and violent -- and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it. thankfully, chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script, which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time, if not ever, completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences.but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves. chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast -- not only did he gain talented martial artists (whose moves, competed without the aid of wires or other special effects, put most modern martial artists to shame) but great actors as well. the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies. getting back to matters at hand, in most old-school movies, the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts, but here the actors actually create characters. it seems that everyone has a favorite venom (mine is philip kwok -- best known to many as mad dog from hard-boiled -- as lizard) and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre. even if you're normally not a fan of old-school movies, you need to check the five deadly venoms out, if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from."

there's no romance or other side plot to this movie, it's action and intrigue all the way, making it a real man's kung-fu movie.an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who's styles represents five venomous animals centipede,snake, scorpion, lizard and the toad. despite the word "venom" in the title, none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents. yan tieh told by his teacher that he's no match for the five former pupil, must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four. how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story, with good kung-fu action spread out throughout the story.recognized as a cult classic, this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung- fu action movies. it's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story.it's no artistic masterpiece, with the usual bad dubbing, and corny acting, but the movie is one of the best of its kind, because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung-fu action movie of its time, and gives an extra concentrated dose of them.one movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan.

of all the kung-fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following. with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story. an aging kung-fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh (sheng chiang) about five pupils he has trained in the past. all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently. their specialty in kung-fu is the name they have adopted like lizard, snake, centipede, toad and scorpion. the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil. an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target. tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are. tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung (pai wei) and along with tang sen kue (feng lu) who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map. a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is. a local policeman named ho yung sin (philip kwok) investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow (chien sun). sin has a friend called li ho (meng lo) who is the toad and they do know of each others identity. the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed. when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue. this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films. chang was not your run of the mill kung-fu director and his films always had a special quality to them. while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme. even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that. five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks. then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is. very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves. i wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as "enter the dragon" because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking. this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes. its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved. that alone makes this different from all the other kung-fu films. very well made with a unique story.

be careful with this one. once you get yer mitts on it, it'll change the way you look at kung-fu flicks. you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung-fu films now, you will be wanting character depth and development, you will be craving mystery and unpredictability, you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops. sadly, you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung-fu movie, except for five deadly venoms!easily the best kung-fu movie of all-time, venoms blends a rich plot, full of twists and turns, with colourful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s. the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which, and who specializes in what venom. one is the centipede, two is the snake, three is the scorpion, four is the lizard, and five is the toad. each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. therein lies the hook, we learn along with the student character, finding out who these different men turn out to be. we are in his shoes (so to speak), and we have to pick who we trust, and who we don't, just like he does. we learn along with him.not only is the plot, the characters, and the camerawork great, it's also fun to watch, which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it's kind. it's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that's going on. venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can really do...just don't expect many other kung-fu films to live up to it's gauntlet.

after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth. the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his "unfinished" pupil out to find the 5 past members of his poison clan, so they do not seek out a fortune which the master's friend keeps hidden. afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training, he instructs him to befriend one of the five "venoms" so as to defeat the other four.i can't say enough about the choreography or the camera work. a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made. a classic!!

well, i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie. despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy, and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, i was not disappointed. the story was actually pretty interesting: the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil, and who is using them for good. the catch being that during training, all of the clan were masked, and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names.the fights are a joy to watch, as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard, and centipede. the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place, and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action.the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence. but stick with it, and you won't be disappointed!

most 70s (and 80s) kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies; usually there are a few well-planned fight sequences, but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes -- like porno films, really.but this one does several things well. most overtly, there is the direction and choreography, which confines each combatant to a 'style' -- it's really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater, but the effect works.second, there is the language of the camera, which uses some impressive techniques(even by today's measure), changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion, and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future.least overt, but most powerful and unexpected, is the construction. the winner of this contest is determined by who 'unfolds' the story. the master (the writer) sets up a game where the lead character doesn't know who he's seeking, which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in. one by one, he figures out who is who, at the same rate we find out who is who. it all follows a tragedy/noir arc. the ending tends toward irony, a la "the sting". much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre.the 'five venoms' idea is the template for tarantino's 'deadly viper assassins' from the "kill bill" volumes.

for all the hoopla, respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians, it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas: action and fight scenes. but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i've ever seen in a martial arts film. five deadly venoms without a doubt is a must see, not only that, a movie you can watch again and again; but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better. it somehow leaves you wanting something, you want more. the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn't follow through with giving us more of the action we want. the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer (centipede,snake,scorpion,lizard,toad) and they are shown, but battles are noticeably short. the toad and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much, much more, in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie. interestingly enough with this movie, the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot, this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome. this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe. sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel. to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon. the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more. still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable. my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this: the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail, sad thing is , the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn't expand on it. i am left wondering what could have been with this movie, still one of the best though. 8 out of 10 on the scale.

seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately. this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic. i happened to see the dubbed version but i'm on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue. still, the dubbing didn't get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour: "poison clan rocks the world!!!"the story-telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue, suspense, and inter-personal relationships. you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace.the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed. it's like watching real animals fight each other, but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms. such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema.the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film's genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution. ...of course, if you just want to see people pummel each other, along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture, be my guest!

the five deadly venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery. there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick: great choreography, awful dubbing, different "styles" of fighting, and a wide range of greatly exaggerated, often cheesey human emotions. however the plot certainly is better than average. it's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes. occasionally it's even able to fire up the audience, such as when x character receives horrible injustice.another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and themes. just about everyone gets what's coming to them. the cowardly, greedy, and corrupt lose out. the bad guys, consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing. the good guys use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top. poison clan rocks!

this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever, and may be one of the best movies ever... it's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle, with lots of intrigue and suspense. this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions, with people hiding their identities and their natures. the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters. they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality's and desires.the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting. it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy. there are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal. the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film... when this happens, the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel. these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely.one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death. the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death. this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective. we actually care when people are killed in this film. this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed. some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching. when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain.at the same time, this is also a fun movie. it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film. there is bad dubbing, the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat. some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic... all this just adds to the greatness of the film.and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries. if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic. everything goes by so fast (because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre) that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is. the lighting and composition are spectacular at times. the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing... in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example, imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed. chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it's confines. he doesn't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film, but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work. he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people.this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level. it's art, it's trash, it's emotionally moving, and it's fun, it has a true sense of morality, but doesn't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action. i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not.

i enjoyed watching cliffhanger, at the beginning when that woman (sarah) was full of terror when she was slipping, i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see, your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster. i did like watching cliffhanger, i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he'll be known as playing rambo and rocky.

this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle. stallone is gabe walker. cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists. renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie. stallone needed this role to get back on track. snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than finnish man. action is good! music in the film is spectacular. the bad guy is john litghow, other stars micheal rooker ( the portrait of serialkiller), janine turner ( strong medicine). the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie. overall good movie ****/*****remember extreme ääliöt: special collectors edition, with good extras. comig soon in finland straight to video.

good action show, but nothing new. this one took place high in the mountains, which showed some nice scenery and such. one man takes on a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks butt. it could have been called "rambo goes to the rockies", it was that pat. it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror. not a bad picture, but just same ol', same ol'.

this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded.this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights,a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well,an exciting plot,and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways.the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play.the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human,much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters.they chose to humanise stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style,weakens the excitement factor.also,the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times.the script should have been more realistic and less "talky".another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses.they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie.instead,they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala "a-team" tv series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.this movie had a lot of all time great potential.crisper action sequences,better dialogue and more rambo/rocky style emotion/determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level.i know this was not stallone's fault.i sense the movie's director wanted to tone down stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer.sill a good movie though........

this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie!stallone was good as always!michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain!the music is fantastic especially the theme!the movie is action packed and never dull!if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger,you won't be disappointed!

cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor. it's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars. it has great action sequence's, edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies.

after the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber (michelle joyner). eight months has passed... the rocky mountain rescue receive a distress call set by a brilliant terrorist mastermind eric quaien (john lithgow). quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside. two experienced climbers walker (sylvester stallone) and tucker (micheal rooker) and a helicopter pilot (janine turner) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by quaien and his men. now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek. while quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped tucker to find the money. once tucker finds the money, tucker will be dead. against explosive firepower, bitter cold and dizzying heights. walker must outwit quaien for survival.directed by renny harlin (driven, mindhunters, a nightmare on elm street 4:the dream master) made an entertaining non-stop action picture. this film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action picture with plenty of dark humour as well. this was one of the biggest hits of 1993. this is one of harlin's best film. lithgow is a terrific entertaining villain. stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller. this is probably harlin's best work as a filmmaker.dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd has an running commentary track by the director with comments by stallone. dvd also has technical crew commentary as well. dvd has behind the scenes featurette, two deleted scenes with introduction by the director and more. do not miss this great action film. screenplay by micheal france (fantastic four) and actor:stallone (the rocky series). based on a premise by john long. excellent cinematography by alex thomson, b.s.c. (alien³, demolition man, legend). oscar nominated for best sound, best sound editing and best visual effects. panavision. (****/*****).

after the success of die hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of 'die hard on a .....' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. that is what they did with cliffhanger, die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly 'stop or my mom will shoot' stallone's career.cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. all in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! however, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.you've got to love john lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, rex linn as travers.he may of been henry in 'portrait of a serial killer' but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' and whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like ralph waite's frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.mention too must go to former 'london's burning' actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, hal needed a good kicking.so forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! and if you're looking for qaulen, he's the one wearing the helicopter.

forget credibilityyou must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats, being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed, and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons... especially when renny harlin is directing."cliffhanger " is no exception. but the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin ( janine turner ), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall, but also rex linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, leon, craig fairbrass ) good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.as roger ebert wrote ( about another film )"it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much."

the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo. but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion.the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before.the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes, the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years.

this movie is just great. it's entertaining from beginning to the end, you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics.sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy gabe walker. together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker. and then, john lithgow, one of the best performances i've seen of him as a villain.and the fact that 75% of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action! brilliant movie!

cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director renny harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains. sylvester stallone is impressive as gabe walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief. the rest of the cast including john lithgow, michael rooker, janine turner, rex linn, caroline goodall, and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. the action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. the villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. if you're a big fan of harlins or stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, thrills, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.

was this based on a comic-book? a video-game? a drawing by a 3 year-old? there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. nothing. we have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ("tango-tango"). a film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. oh, yes: and the unintentional humour.the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a "swell" time. then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. and then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell. stallone's melodramatic exchange with turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clichéd, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. the entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. after the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker. they send stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). do these gangsters want their money fetched or not??? very silly. apparently they don't trust stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using rooker as a hostage. nevertheless, our gangsters make stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. everyone convinced? good. you'd better be. otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone.the old guy who flies the chopper... how the hell did he fall for the trap? firstly, he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard stallone's and rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. "get off my back!" lithgow: "i haven't even started climbing on your back." or, lithgow to stallone: "we had a deal, but now we only have each other!" and as for lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. they are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on. stallone co-wrote this thing. i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. i'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i.q.

since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it. the setting has a lot to do with it (the colorado i know would be jealous), but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes. there has not been a movie i can compare this too. john lithgow plays a smart villain, but i love how he is completely out of his element--he has to follow tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting. this is an action movie at it's best. i don't think i'll see another that is so entertaining.you don't need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie. it just has to keep you captivated, not shell-shocked.

to be honest, i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time. but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater. big mistake ! because the #1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and #2 is the cinematography. try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system. the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential). the more i see it, the more i like it.it's definitely one of renny harlin's best movie. this guy knows about action. die hard 2, the long kiss good bye, etc. and it's particularly good in this movie. the special effect are great and spectacular. stallone really needed that movie get back with success. still good to see him !

i'm far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role. and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though i feared the worst.when gabe (stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. for almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. at least, that's what the rangers believe. in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. i know him best from the tv-series "3rd rock from the sun", but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. overall the acting is ok, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. i loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests... perhaps that's why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. i give it a 6.5/10. if you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.

watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as "die hard in a /on a." cliffhanger is "die hard on a mountain," and pretty good, for what it is.but unlike passenger 57 and under siege, which are decent die hard clones on their own terms, cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that, in their immensity, threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks.years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations, cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings.the opening sequence has already received substantial praise, all of which it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening. not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke (and which he repeated in deep blue sea), or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face, can dim the sequence's power.the next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet. as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin, the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected. as roger ebert has observed, the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. so far as i know, no one was killed in the making of this movie (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot. but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin (or more likely one of the second-unit directors) knew exactly where to place the camera.i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain, and at the same time actually feels that pain. the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths: he plays an older, more vulnerable kind of action hero, giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself.in contrast to many of today's post-matrix, comic book-inspired action heroes, stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities. in cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes to death, and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another. he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut, particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains.it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness: when i first saw this movie as a teenager, i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust (or rather, the ice); at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold-blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise.lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter, but he's fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue: in one scene, looking at his hostages stallone and rooker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, he actually says "you, stay! you, fetch!" even a better actor, such as anthony hopkins, might have had trouble with that line.even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside, it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show.early in the movie, for example, lithgow openly says to one of his men "retire [stallone] when he comes down." no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously: his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face, and this precipitates a gripping tug-of-war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg.lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means, but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor.done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or (at times) a western, cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film.besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before, the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative. finally, harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless, since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes.it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies, because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later. but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time, without a sequel: there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already. there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit: compared to that clinker, cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list.rating: 8 (very good, especially considering most of stallone's other movies.)

sly's best out and out action film. it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured. stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's, a definite genre classic. as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories. plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form. action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner, michael rooker and john lithgow. ****

wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge, an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker (stallone) comes back for his girlfriend jessie (janine turner), while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening, a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing stranded off the snowy peaks, and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash, the high-trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit unfortunately, gab and hall (michael rooker) have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake, and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (john lithgow),are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money with breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures, "cliffhanger" is definitely stallone's best action adventure movie

i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin. 'die hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. that's right, you little punks, 'cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.sly plays gabe walker, a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend, hal tucker (michael rooker), assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen (john lithgow). qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u.s. government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back...essentially, 'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone. just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. naturally, that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough, as stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease, and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. after all, isn't that what action movies are all about?'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. a showcase of great scenes and stunts. one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.'cliffhanger' is easily one of stallone's best efforts, definitely renny harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10

at the end of the movie i still don't know whether i liked it or not. so was the case with most of the reviewers. but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in. long ago i read a quote: there are 2 kind of writers, 1. those who think and write. and 2. those write and make the readers think. while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience.i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight club....it is definitely a classic: something which no one understands but appreciates....what i don't understand: why stathom(jake green) had a blackout (thats how it all began), all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one.well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about: i'll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not: then answer this first.... when you come across a puzzle labeled as 'no one has ever solved' would you like to try? i would

aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie, i think i've watched every movie guy ritchie has directed. twice. needless to say, i'm a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why. this movie is a very different approach from ritchie, when you look at it comparatively with lock, stock... and snatch. revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn't expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn't know he needed. along with seeing andré benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability, other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr. d/macha and mark strong playing sorter, the hit-man.after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner, macha, jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent. when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha, jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that's left him with three days to live. a team of loan sharks, however, have an answer for him and a ticket to life- only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them, all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself. along with having the air of death loom, and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money, jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him, which introduces sorter - a hit-man under macha's employ. the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co- convicts he spent time with in solitary may very-well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into. when faced with this reality though, zack (vincent pastore) and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary, having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake. the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons.the style of the movie is top-notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes. although a lot of nods at ritchie's previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue, the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre. it's also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should. the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and, true to ritchie fashion, they're all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone's affairs. i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don't want to take too much away from it if you haven't seen it yet.it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it's a great movie and it should be seen. if you're lucky and you haven't seen the watered-down us release, see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take. i saw it with my crew around early-2006 and we're still talking about it with little things we've picked up on today. it has garnered its cult status, and it's well- deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit.standout line: "fear or revere me, but please, think i'm special. we share an addiction. we're approval junkies."

"ah ritchie's made another gangster film with statham" thought the average fan, expecting another snatch/lock stock; expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts, but none too hard for "me and the lads" to swallow after a few beers.ah, pay attention, you do need to watch this film. no cups of tea, no extra diet cokes from the counter, no "keep it running" shouts as you nip to the fridge - watch the film! no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence (and if that floats your boat, so be it) but sharp solid direction, excellent dialogue, and great performances.my favourite - big pussy from the sopranos, always a reliable hood.

i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art. i was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2.not only does guy bring together a b list(ish) movie cast and make them into such glorious characters, he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination.far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate...yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable.this film is special. get it, now!

i'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever. absolutely smashed, stunned and dazed by the whole picture, marvellous playing of jason statham, ray liotta and all the crew, amazing plot... just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit-it touched your soul, because it's strange, but there are all the answers you've been ever looking for... the very best, mr. ritchie! the very best ever. those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed. but there are lots of shallow movies in hollywood nowadays, you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it. on the contrary, revolver is unique, i could have hardly expected it's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself, of everyone who was to watch it. absolutely unsurpassed, astounding, dazzling... one can get insight watching this, i have no doubt about that. actually, no words can express my admiration... i'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy hollywood rubbish we had been watching. thank you from all heart, it's simply the best.

it's all very simple. jake goes to prison, and spends five years with the con and the chess masters. they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure, and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks. they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom: from his innermost fears, from what he believes to be himself. for that, they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear, all the pride, all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will.it's a clever movie about the journey of illumination, about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.

i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life. believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all-time classic. i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock, stock.... and snatch, but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed. i absolutely loved this film and i can't wait to see it again. this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films, and also a lot better. i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie. i believe he has taken movie-making to another level ( i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film, but i believe time will prove me right ). this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the 2hr or so running time as i couldn't stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together. i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film ( some answers from endless hours of thinking, some answers from reading other people's take on the film )and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again. i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been.

neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist, revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers. but then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework. as might be expected from luc besson's name on the credits as producer, there's a definite element of 'cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. if anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of machiavelli, a dash of godard, a lot of the principles of chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie. rather than a commercial for kabbalism, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con.the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it's got a lot going for it all the same. not worth starting a new religion over, but i'm surprised it didn't get a us distributor. maybe they found ray liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?

having read the reviews for this film, i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good. however, this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. the majority of reviews that i had read, said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. and whilst some parts do leave you confused, the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much. it's not like "lock, stock..." or "snatch", in the sense that it isn't that funny (in fact, it's pretty dark), and it is a lot more intelligent, in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself). the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned, is that it is full of memorable characters, specifically statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the lead, and ray liotta, who spends most of the film in speedos, but gives a great performance none the less. if you've got time, and have time afterwards to think about the film, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film. i think it's fantastic, and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game.

i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone! the fact is it wasn't what anyone was expecting, especially from guy ritchie. what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners "do ya like dags?" etc, but this is far more mature than his previous works. i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder, this film demands all your attention! look past the cool and dazzling look of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film.yes this has its influences from modern classics( fight club, pulp fiction etc ) but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none. i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney "masterpieces".

first of all, don't go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock, this is a different sort of gangster film.i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience. it's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that? that was awful, and the other half will leave thinking what was that? that was cool. personally i like films that i don't understand, i.e.mullholland drive, and usual suspects, so i enjoyed revolver. it definitely wasn't perfect though. i saw the big twist coming a mile away, at least part of it, and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good, revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed. also some scenes, like the animation, and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree(actually one of my favourites), although, awesome scenes to watch, seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch, not because they fit in with the movie.however there were many good things too. i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors, jason stratham, ray liotta, vincent pastore, and even andre benjamin(who was a pleasant surprise). this movie definitely kept my interest, with one great, suspenseful, action packed, scene after another. when ray liotta was being held under the table wow....well you have to see it. the script was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, as with most guy ritchie films, was great.though a step below such movies as,fight club, mullholland drive, and usual suspects, it was still an awesome fast paced, psychological, action movie, with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over.

i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away. it is a real masterpiece of art and i don't understand why most of the people think it's garbage. the main idea of the movie - take your ego away and then you will have true power! this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way. "the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look" - do you remember this from the movie? because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego... that voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take, that creates our aggression, that wants to be in control, that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance. a superb movie!

i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think, and don't just drip-feed the answers to their audience. "revolver" is one of these films, and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow, with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it. first time. true, it doesn't compare to other mind-mucks like "the usual suspects" or "memento", but in its own right its an intelligent and thought-provoking film. another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is. every scene, every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages. if you see it you'll know what i mean.so, to conclude... watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it. if not, well, no-one ever said "revolver" is for everyone. and that's my 2 cents.

first of all, when people hear 'guy ritchie', they immediately think of snatch. yes, snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch. they don't expect him to explore new frontiers. this movie revolver is different than snatch; it's much darker and is very complex. the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because i've had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything. so this movie toys with your head. it's very cleverly written.this movie is different than snatch. it was done wonderfully, the cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize guy ritchie's personal touch (style of directing) in it.what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers.

ok... this movie so far has been slated by critics and board-posters alike (although playing devil's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as film-makers, and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics) so i wanted to sit in guy's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it.the film's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is. this has been described many times as as making the film "inaccessible" to the viewer. the film's chronology is relatively non-linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle (or not so subtle) hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory, ie. ray liotta's character brandishing a gun saying the words "fear me" is portrayed as both tragically pathetic (from statham's pov) or interrogating and bold (from liotta's pov). this is but one example of ritchie's far more mature approach he has taken to film-making with revolver, we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal (the strong but silent gritty anti-hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption... i mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys, all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice-overs) but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points.take the scene where jason statham's character runs afoul of a car. this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever... but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death.so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling, i'd be taking the p*ss if i said i didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going "uh... wtf?"... but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art. it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand. and even easier to say "well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film!". in my humble opinion, revolver is a stylish, complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers. if we choose this opportunity to collectively say "ah sh*t, i wanted a film about a load of bleeding' cockney gangsters in-nit loll... guy ritchie is a tit!" then the day will come when film-makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow, crappy people. just because guy made a name for himself with funny, cheeky cockney romps, doesn't mean he can't be deep without being "pretentious". funny people can be thoughtful too.

this picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of sheriff buford pusser. bo svenson takes over the role of sheriff buford pusser, and luke askew plays the role of mobster pinky dobson. the last that we saw sheriff pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed sunday morning drive. after pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. is pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes. the only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story. how could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it. since there was real no name actress in this picture i can't give it 10 weasel stars but i can give 8

this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen. then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them. we know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car. and that is what happens. now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film. that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. now, how is he going to get out of it? that's what you must discover by yourself. and don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story. a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. we also know when he is going to be wounded. they did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. it's true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq. but what is the meaning of such a film? this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them, to do them. it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

this was the first "walking tall" movie i saw, i think in a $2 movie theater along hollywood blvd. , so i didn't have any reference to the first installment done by joe don baker. i remember being shocked at the corrupted system of mcnairy county and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". i was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he's not going to let it slide, and went out to do something about it. courageous ? i thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine.i think this movie is a great story about american courage to stand up and do something about a system that's only serving its own interest. i was pretty blown away about it, and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero/anti-hero genre, which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the "the punisher", but even more so because it's a true story. the recent remake starring the "rock" just doesn't do any justice to the real fire in the story of buford pusser.a "classic" that i'm sure will resurface again in the future.

i first watched the walking tall movies when i was about 8 years old and i thought both joe don baker and bo svenson did a great job, they must have anyway because since watching the movies, i have tried to learn as much about the real sheriff buford pusser as i can. all 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and buford pusser was a true hero, i only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him. i would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. i am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. my heart goes out to them. so from a 30 year old fan of sheriff pusser and of the 3-part walking tall movies and the actors that portrayed him, please do not be negative about these movies and actors, they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real buford pusser was and what a great family he had. and to all the young people who may have not heard much about buford, i suggest you watch the walking tall movies and learn more about him.

the story is extremely unique.it's about these 2 pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly.the whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time,friends,and mentors.the ending could have been fantastic.it started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very bad.the animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays.i have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity.i actually found it to be somewhat decent.the nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess.overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic.

being an otaku since the days of robotech, i can still say that gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. there are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality. although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film. although it has been described as being "sappy," it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do. since the main character is a female, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to "macho-man" tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers. the seiryuu for noriko, incidentally, also plays akane in ranma 1/2. noriko is as 3-dimensional a cartoon can get; her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will. the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears. even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious "homing laser" and "buster shield" (which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style) technique. i doubt that scene was meant to be funny, but it cracked me up. yet all in all, i would rank gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time.

this anime is a must-see for fans of evangelion. it's an earlier work of anno hideaki, but his unrestrained, dramatic style is quite in place. also, those who didn't like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable. gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime in that it's actually based on real science. in fact, the show has several little "science lesson" interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie. one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light. the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed. the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably. be warned, this show is heavy on the sap at times. it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen. i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one. on an interesting note, gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes. however, they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway. the ending is a bit silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn't help but love it. gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of anime around.

/* slight spoilers */way back, before evangelion was made, before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, gunbuster was made. with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time, and the famous otakon shorts or course, gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up. it didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera.luckily, gainax decided to put it out as a six-part oav (direct to video) series. this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam, and many other popular space operas.for one, the shows starts out pretty light, with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting. noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid. this makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors. the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and noriko and kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out.the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. a couple more characters are introduced, and parts of noriko's past are dragged up again. besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented. smart as writer okada was, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit. in short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her. the science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where noriko, kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series.the animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. the designs are retro 80s style of course, but it has it's charm. animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest. the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. the last episode was entirely done in black and white. while it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part.the music is very typical space opera fair. too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. it does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he's worked on is dragon half. if you think 80s anime music, you will know what to expect.as the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row. neither aspect is ever left completely out though. with the last episode in sight, noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. while they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought. the last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. again, it fits the series.gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. but it is done exceptionally well for a change. instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. the show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points. overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. overall, the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little. highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws.***/*****

aim for the top! gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it. i totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favorite anime. and while it was not gainax's first animated product, it was their first ova series.mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970's sports drama aim for the ace (ace o nerae!), gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2, when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with. it is because of her father's death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot. but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. her friend, kazumi amano, even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot. however, noriko's coach, koichiro ota, has faith in her. and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko's father was killed.other characters include jung-freud, a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to, smith toren, a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and kimiko higuchi, noriko's childhood friend. kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while noriko is off in space, kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life. and because of the acts of time dilation, kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. by the end of the series, noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid-fifties.all in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation. if you like hideaki anno's other shows, or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. it will grow on you.

star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways. first, it's a fan made series, available only on the web, and it features mainly friends & neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to, as mickey & judy once put it, put on a show. it's definitely friends & neighbors to, you can tell. a lot of these people aren't the most beautiful looking folks you've ever seen, or the youngest, or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like they're walking on marbles some of them have thick accents, or simply don't seem to speak well in the first place, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they're saying. still, you have to admit, for everything these friends & neighbors have put together, it's actually fun to watch. yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. yes, it's a little odd (though admittedly a little cool too) watching two starfleet males kiss (although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on.) yes, you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st:tos, tng, other shows and the movies, or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show. okay. we can get by that. why? the graphics are first rate. better than almost anything you've seen. and sometimes, a show or two really stands out story-wise some of them are actually real tear-jerkers.hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due. it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude. people, sets, costumes, graphics it's a huge effort on a lot of people's parts. we watch, we return, and we thank them.

hidden frontiers-is more than fan fiction- it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of star trek alive and growing. from a fun little fan project to now a well known net series; hidden frontiers has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it. set in the late star trek: next generation/ds9 and voyager time lines hidden frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other star trek series with set stories using a well developed characters, plots, and story arcs. star trek hidden frontier has taken on social context stories that gene roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space assignments - the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting spatial wars and conflicts sci-fi addicts know and love. done in a "green screen" studio; hidden frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts. the large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. inventive use of green screen technology, props, makes up and costumes work to make the hidden frontier worlds of star trek fun and believable. hidden frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction, and thrived once they got there. hidden frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat. i highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.

this is short and to the point. the story writing used for star trek: hidden frontier is surprisingly good. acting is all over the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills. it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-may 2007.i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics. considering this is all-volunteer, for no profit, it is pretty amazing.if this was being ranked as a professional production, i would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets. however, as a fan-based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts, this is in a league of its own. for sheer volume, i don't think this has been matched. congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire.

with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast. nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work. anyone heard of adobe after effects 7, they should buy it get their keying better.stories are well thought out, plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context. but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode. im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining (dont mind women). anyway... for a fan series this is good stuff. with minor improvement in their green screen, brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning. anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds9.

hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry's mission. their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies. the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved, the stories are more complex, and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive. in season 6 episode 1, countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history. the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting. the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters. there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked!

i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it. i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view. i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out. i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll my compliments to the staff of the star trek hidden frontiers on an excellent job. if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film. the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it

okay, so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way, but from the beginning, hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances, and have always been willing to mistakes they've made. they advice people to see newer episodes first, so they can see just how good the show is, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen. the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show, as the story lines go from strength to strength. the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression, drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way, but that is what star trek is and was all about. it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. yes, they have used some characters from trek history, but they have done them justice - characters like shelby, lefler and necheyev, vastly underused in the show, had a rebirth in the new frontier books, but they lost their sizzle after a while, when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi, and hf shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved. they release bloopers for every episode, so the fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people doing it in their spare time, with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock! what this series, now drawing to a close after 7 years, has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. hf will live for a long time after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.

i kind of consider myself as the #1 fan of hidden frontier, seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - well, not counting conventions, of course. i have been watching hidden frontier since 2001, and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with.hidden frontier is the brainchild of rob caves and his self-made studio, areakt pictures, which operates out of the back room of his house. while not as "fancy" as, say, the tos-based series new voyages (which sometimes gets some of the actors/writers from the original series, like walter koenig, aka mr. chekov), rob and the cast and crew of hf manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called "enterprise". the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star trek's first openly gay character, corey aster (who was introduced in the second season), and his search to find a soul mate. somewhere later in the series, he meets jorian zen, the excelsior's trill helm officer. in the recent story lines with these two characters (warning: major spoiler! do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point!), zen is joined to an exiled symbiont, causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with aster. though the future is uncertain - seeing as the most recent episode, "beachhead", was just shown to hf fans in the chat room last night - i think that this relationship will endure, but only time will tell.gene roddenberry created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles. rob caves created hidden frontier for that same reason - and this is what has made this series as popular as it is. as the previous comment stated, i wish i could give it a rating higher than 10, but it will have to suffice. although next season will be the last - keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek: the next generation - i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode.

this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans, and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and twisting, and it's characters show realistic depth and dimension. the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking. while it's first season might be a little shaky, it's final few are well thought out and well shot. some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise, but these fans don't take no for an answer. i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike, 10/10 hidden frontier crew.make it so...

nicely done, and along with "new voyages" it's a great continuation! fab to see james cawley in the latest episode "vigil" check it out! i like the growing characterisation, and think we have good replacements for the tv actors in a fan-produced piece. this show manages to capture the feel quite well, as they state on the ste, it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience, a strong script editor, and a pick-up in timing and cgi that hf will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is!good work to all concerned!(i have a huge soft spot for lefler & mcfarland (great acting), although i'm a bit tired of "lefler's laws". enough already! shelby's great (if a little uptight) and it's cool she got the ship. commodore ian's nice (like fred flintstone), but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself. the doc, counselor, and rawlins are right on the money in my eyes, as is the wonderful nechayev (what a beautiful accent - a real russian! (well, i'm guessing rene hails from the czech rep.)it gets my vote, and the cgi is kewl. some of the greenscreen's obvious, but on a small budget whaddayagonndo?really glad i found it!(ok, some of the acting isn't great but it's fan-made and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry cmm. cole)the gay material is layed on too thick (graham norton'd be embarrassed). trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging? it's not necessary to showpiece someone's sexuality to this extent - i hope they tone it down & let aster & zen be people not tokens - i don't treat my gay friends any differently, they're just regular guys.musically it's a mixed bag. i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time, but timing can fall flat now & then (the end of "worst fears part 2" misses the crunch, and the edit. love the fact they use the "galaxy quest" music!i certainly can't wait for more!! dazza"never give up, never surender!"viva les frontieres

for the record, i am not affiliated with the production in any way.hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date. over 7 seasons (this is the last) they have produced some 50 or so episodes.this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy.by their own admission, the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects, green screen work and acting all improve.i did find it difficult to "dip into" so started from the beginning and watched all the way through. hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set. characters and "relatives" from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories, sometimes improving on the characters over the original.the whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper reels, a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat.if you are looking for high definition, high budget productions, this is probably not for you.if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think, this is the one.

star trek: hidden frontier is a long-running internet only fan film, done completely for the love of the series, and a must watch for fans of trek. the production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin' it. this doesn't take away from the overall experience however. the cgi ships are fantastic, as well as the space battle scenes... on the negative side, i could tell in the earlier episodes (and even occasionally in the newer ones) that some of the actors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles, but once again, this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek. the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here, and, as a whole,i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9.

hidden frontier is a fan made show, in the world of star trek. the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta-quadrant . it has some characters from the official star trek shows, but most of them are original to the show. the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships, which gives it opportunities the official shows don't have. the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship doesn't have. the show has good computer animation of spaceships, but the acting takes place in front of at green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors. not all the actors are equally good, but most do fine. the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes. that is a bit more like in babylon 5, than in most official star trek shows. hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using. all in all i enjoyed watching it.

hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based star trek fan series. while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter, or new voyages, hidden frontier concentrates largely on story, and in that regard it does very well indeed.hidden frontier has no physical sets; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen, and the backgrounds inserted digitally. one of hidden frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, instead of in post-production. while this does save a great deal of time, it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, though it still serves its purpose. while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, hidden frontier is well worth a shot, though you might be best to start off watching the third season, since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride.

jane porter's former love interest harry holt(neil hamilton) and his friend martin (paul cavanagh) come to tarzan's hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the "elephant's graveyard" first seen in tarzan, the ape man...only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions...namely jane. will tarzan stand for that? not likely (in fact tarzan won't even stand for any disturbance done to the "elephant's graveyard") and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party (including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead)is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions..will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time?this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and doesn't let up. the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn't be taken so seriously.

ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect? well, unfortunately "convention city" is lost, so well just have to watch "tarzan and his mate" to find out. for 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. just look at jane's nude swim. while tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out.in addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. i've always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s, but there are few from the genre i'd call great films. "tarzan and his mate" is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre. the sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today. also, the animals are all too cool (espescially the apes throwing boulders). the acting won't win any major awards soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture. the film is once again stolen by cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. one of the most entertaining examples of pre-code hollywood out there.

make no mistake, maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever, and there will never be one more gorgeous. she is visually stunning. that aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. this is a great film. it not only has the classic tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga. we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory, one of them in love with jane, the other, a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history.and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic. there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted. however, the africans are depicted as individuals, and at the end, two even become more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. in fact, the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. the finale, also, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. the great lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction. if i left anything out, it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it. but it is everything you could want in a movie.

tarzan and his mate(1934) was the only tarzan movie i didn't see when i was a kid. it sounded boring. now i have seen it. i have seen the ape man(1932) about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive. it's a remarkable movie. it's almost flawless. tarzan and his mate(1934) however, falters. it's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own. the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great. big budget expensive. tarzan himself is co-starring. jane dominates. she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead. well. she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant. she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father. forever. the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle. stupid? later someone founds it in the river. well it's supposed to proof tarzan is dead. some cheap drama. the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone. she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away(to england). stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is, how hard he is to kill. the caravan is leaving and jane go along. again a pothole. she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more, to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband. she could be smart. she could dive where they found the floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in liana's. picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle jane. she could talk to the apes, and so on. if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable. jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down. and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with "i blame myself as much as you". a punishment for being vane perhaps? nonsense. struggle, a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate. still. this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep. just lean back and enjoy. it's tarzan and jane for god sake.

108: tarzan and his mate (1934) - released 4/20/1934, viewed 8/6/08.john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa. bonnie & clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas. births: ralph nader, gloria steinem, alan arkin, richard chamberlain.doug: after we were rather disappointed with the original 'tarzan the ape man,' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film, 'tarzan and his mate,' was the best in the series. it's true. i got a huge kick out of this movie. johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging, animal dueling wild super-hero, and maureen o'sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane (who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). in my review for 'ape man,' i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but she's redeemed herself for me here. make no mistake: o'sullivan is the star of this movie, and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets. she's even got her own jungle scream now. the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible. she's totally got him trained. cheeta is quite charming as well, taking drags off of martin's cigarette. the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhinos. the effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely. oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. all i can say is: yes, she is naked. very exciting stuff.kevin: wow. just wow. when it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure, nothing holds a candle to 'tarzan and his mate.' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick-ass, violent and risqué jungle epic. i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does. you'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code-approved, or animal rights-approved for that matter. the gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies. and after t&j enter the picture, there's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims. see it for yourself if you don't believe me. i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film. in the first film, jane seemed like a walking contradiction, like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that. but here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema. although she still requires tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams, she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued. her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. i watched this with my mom, and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan "trained," as jeff foxworthy put it. she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call. although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film, there is still plenty of hair-raising tarzan vs. predator battles that are performed (mostly) for real. that and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around. **spoiler** the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing. although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious, i can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again. **end spoiler** one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller's smooth, hairless bod and over-styled coif. other than that, this is pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed.last film: it happened one night (1934). next film: twentieth century (1934).

a year after losing gorgeous jane parker (maureen o'sullivan) to love rival tarzan, hunter harry holt (neil hamilton) returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe's heart. mixing business with pleasure, he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment, tarzan's stomping ground.accompanied by his slimy, womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers, harry finally arrives at his destination (having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock-hurling apes) only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller, and worse still, that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard.nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape-man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. of course, tarzan isn't deadonly wounded; after being nursed back to health by cheetah (!), he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who have attacked holt's expedition.tarzan and his mate, the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series; although i slightly prefer the original, i can definitely understand the film's popularity: it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences! the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o'sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes, and with both stars wearing eensy-weensy outfits throughout, there's eye-candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy (despite o'sullivan's much-touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double, the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin, even threatening to do a 'sharon stone' at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side!).the film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile, and the spectacular finalé where jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is rescued by her beau, his monkey pals, and a load of elephants in full-on lion-crushing mode (once again, the violence is surprisingly nasty at times, although as far as i am concerned, there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film). cheetah also has his fair share of excitement, dodging rhinos, crocs, and big cats, riding on tarzan's back as he crosses a river, and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride.like it's predecessor, tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing propsdodgy back projection, a few laughable monkey suits, more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins, and poorly disguised trapeze swingsbut these shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film. if anything, they make it even more fun!8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for imdb.

one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed (and graphic).picking up a year or so after tarzan the ape man, niel hamilton's holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory. his friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that holt hopes to use to win jane back from tarzan. before they can leave holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition. when they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded. they have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire. eventually tarzan and jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures.infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence (its graphic even by todays standards. it probably would get a pg 13) and to remove all hint of nudity, (there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity, it was only recently restored). its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for tv. as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic, touching, action filled and everything else that a movie should be. its an amazing film by almost any standard. best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure, one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it, but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film. its an amazing thing.i really like this film a great deal.if there are any flaws to the film, its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well. the rear screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing. however on almost every other level this film is top notch.you really owe it to yourself to see this. make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time. this is one of the great adventures.

i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd (fully restored editions) & i never tire of watching them. my personal favorite is "tarzan and his mate", due entirely (well almost entirely) to maureen o'sullivan's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front. before anyone claims that a - it wasn't really her, or b - it wasn't really what it looks like, let me say that i have watched it numerous time, in high zoom mode, and trust me...it is her, and she is completely naked underneath that costume...several times, especially during the lion attack at the end, careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia...there is no mistake about that at all. as to the swimming scene being a body double in a "skin" suit, yes, it is a double, but she is not wearing any "skin" suit or anything else...again, slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it. now, that controversy out of the way, let's move on the actual movie...i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly...the action sequences were simply great, although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino, weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion...the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio & us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which. don't complain too much though, remember that 90% of all films is phony anyway, so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn, some cold beer, and a fresh pack of smokes...a sexy and willing girlfriend/wife isn't out of line either...lol. oh...one final word about nudity...at the very beginning, while the white hunters are speaking dialogue, keep your eyes on the background extras...there are several good shots of nude african girls (obviously shot on location) behind them. one more thing, the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930's until the 1960's...that's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then. shaft hadn't even been thought about at that time, nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history. safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads...and tiny's character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane. as a matter of fact, it wasn't until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so.

hard to believe, perhaps, but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code. yes indeed, priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin.i'm not making this up. they had several reasons, as follows:item: jane likes sex. she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter. she stretches sensuously, and with a coquettish look she says "tarzan, you've been a bad boy!" so they've not only been having sex, they've been having kinky sex! a few years later, under the hays code, people (especially women) weren't supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex.item: jane prefers a guileless, if wise and resourceful, savage (tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine-to-five man (holt). when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london, she wavers a bit; when holt tries to kill tarzan, and holt and jane both believe he's dead, she wavers a lot. but when she realizes her man is very much alive, the attractions of civilization vanish for her. and why not? tarzan's and jane's relationship is egalitarian: he lacks the "civilized" insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as "the head of his wife". to boot, he lacks many more "civilized" hangups, for example jealousy. when holt and his buddy arrive, tarzan greets them both cordially, knowing perfectly well that holt is jane's old flame. when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow-dancing with her to a portable phonograph, tarzan drops out of a tree, and draws his knife. jealous? nope. he's merely cautious toward the weird music machine, since he's never seen one before. once it's explained, he's cool.item: civilized holt is dirty minded. savage tarzan is innocently sexy. as jane slips into holt's lamplit tent, holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress. by contrast, after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off, kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her, there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema: the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet.(the scene was filmed in three versions--clothed, topless and nude--the scene was cut prior to the film's release, but the nude version is restored in the video now available.) and when jane emerges, and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease, jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of "civilized" men and their hangups. where is the "universal prurience" so dear to the hearts of seminarians? nowhere, that's where. another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful. item: the notion that man is the crown of creation, and animals are here only for man's use and comfort, takes a severe beating. holt and his buddy want to be guided to the "elephant graveyard" so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home. they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard. you, reader, are thinking "fat chance!" and you're right. he's shocked. he exclaims "elephants sleep!" which to him explains everything. jane explains tarzan's feelings, which the two "gentlemen" find ridiculous. item: jane, the ex-civilized woman, is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies. holt and buddy blow it, and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. it is jane who maintains her cool. while the boys panic, she takes charge, barks orders at them and passes out the rifles.item: jane's costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath. (the original idea was for her to be topless, with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples, which indeed is the case in one brief scene.)lastly, several men of the cloth complained because the film was called "tarzan and his mate" rather than "tarzan and his wife." no comment!of course, tarzan, who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends, comes to the rescue, routs the white hunters, and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came. the end.so there you have it. an utterly subversive film. like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, e.g., possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey) which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30's and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code. the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane's soprano version of the famous tarzan yell. a nice touch, which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions.let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist jane, and sex.

tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle. some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization. but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave. one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back...even if that means killing tarzan.this is a rarity--a sequel that's better than the original. "tarzan, the ape man" of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged. this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult. there is tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot to death point blank--and no one really cares) but this was 1934. there's also plenty of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude! there's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and (it's implied) they sleep together and have sex--without being married. this wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme.that aside, the movie is well-directed, very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement. seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane's outfit is pretty revealing too. i still think maureen o'sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan. everybody else is ok.this is easily the best weismuller--o'hara tarzan out there. well worth seeing but not for kids!

the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny weissmuller. the plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again. just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role. if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a reference..you are missing a real treat. doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making, makeup set designs...no one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny weissmuller did. he was and is tarzan.

in the opinion of several of my friends and family members, including myself, this is the finest of the entire gamut of tarzan movies. johnny weissmuller never played the part as well in the following issues in the series. it definitely rates a "10" in my collection of films.

a very interesting entertainment, with the charm of the old movies. tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it, and we all enjoy with him his success.the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills (he was a great swimmer and had a great shout)

this splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm. it is a first-class adventure for many reasons, i suggest--fine photography, strong imaginative qualities, a delightful cast, good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline. johnny weissmuller plays tarzan, a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs' creation; but he is honest, loyal, brave and very courageous, and he needs to be during this narrative. as jane parker, his wife who had been jane porter in the novels, maureen o'sullivan is very attractive and lively, as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality. the effect of the lighting, the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual. this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back-lot which really works. the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed; but into their idyll come people searching from them, emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated. one is harry holt, still in love with her, who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him; the gown and perfumes interest her, but she refuses to leave tarzan. tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals, in scenes that look like a humanized king king. the group claim to want to hunt animals, and tarzan agrees for jane's sake to a bit of big game trapping; but at some point, the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition's heads' minds. tarzan is shot, left for dead; and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous "elephant's graveyard". but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions. tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call; in a most spectacular elephant-filled scene, he saves jane and what is left of the expedition, who return home little richer but much wise, as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband. the film was directed by set-design wizard cedric gibbons, and quite beautifully too. his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film,which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish. neil hamilton is a very good harry, paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad. forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally. an unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well. recommended.

this was the second of the series of 6 "classic tarzan" movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o'sullivan as jane.as usual, this was a wonderful film in this series; and perhaps stands out as an "in between" film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s. as such, it displayed good pace, though not as good as subsequent films. likewise, the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series. the stock i saw was of uneven quality, containing some grainy scenery and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes. the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here. on the other hand, there is one scene, very early on, in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up, showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle, was really almost modern in its style, and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie.regarding plot, one interesting feature here was jane's near-fickleness and inconstancy, when she was being subject to martin's flirtations. the kiss  and jane's stunned, and partly guilty, reaction  foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films. compare, for example, in tarzan finds a son! jane's duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family. later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong. here, nothing quite so explicit, but we have jane "returning" to the jane parker of yesteryear, and in an almost repentant series of actions, stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzan.there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing.for one thing, the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here, as later, a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death. this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience.i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today's standards.there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants' graveyard; tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo, and then nursed to health by the apes; cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log. the final battle scenes of savages & lions on the ground and savages & apes in the trees. jane, showing us that she is truly of tarzan's world now, quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away.the final series of scenes is splendid: suddenly tarzan is on the scene, flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions, and summoning the elephants to the rescue! that final cry of tarzan in triumph, holding a happy jane in his arms, with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them, is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and jane.all in all, this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie. i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone.

"tarzan and his mate", the second of mgm's tarzan pictures, picks up a year after the events of "tarzan the ape man". tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle, and harry holt (one of the expeditioners in the first film) returns, this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable martin arlington, in quest of the ivory from the elephants' graveyard. naturally, a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way.the first film romanticized everything--the jungle, adventure, romance itself, wild animals, and even death. the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences, but a more serious tone underlies the action. the characters dare to ask questions like: what if something happened to tarzan? what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself? while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation, it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn't always as much fun as the throw-caution-to-the-wind attitude of the original.one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane's relationship. tarzan still speaks very broken english, but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate. additionally, their love for each other has really blossomed, and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle.most people consider "tarzan and his mate" superior to the original "tarzan the ape man". personally, i liked the first film just a little bit better. the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt & martin arlington team isn't nearly as likable as holt's relationship with james parker (jane's father) from the original. the mr. arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain, but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie. the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him. (also, i don't want to give anything away, but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him, jane never finds out about those events, so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been.) all of these detractors are relatively minor, however, and it's still a great movie.like the first film, "tarzan and his mate" has amazing action scenes, wonderful wildlife footage, and one of the screen's all-time greatest romances. if you liked the first film in the series, this is definitely a sequel to see.

when i was a kid it was lex barker's time as tarzan. i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller "was" tarzan and i wouldn't understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller's last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape. it wasn't after many years that i came across "tarzan and his mate", and then i understood. weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker, gordon scott, jock mahoney, denny miller, miles o'keefe and cristopher lambert.as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o'sullivan a strong, self minded, active and "no-inhibitions" woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made (tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the "janes" to come such as brenda joyce, vanessa brown, virginia huston or dorothy hart, all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle.o'sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. another highlight in the movie is cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day."tarzan and his mate" stands as a fine product in its genre (tarzan films) and perhaps as the best, though i have to admit that i also enjoyed "tarzan's greatest adventure" (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect "all gymnasium" physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man).good for jane and her mate!

like tarzan the ape man (1932), only more so. there's more of everything, more animals, more varied african tribes, and scenes in which the thought must be, if this was good with three or four lions, forty would be better. tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin, around and around, jaws flapping. tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still. tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals. his friends are real chimps, people wearing larger ape costumes, and elephants. in fact, they use indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than african oneswith costume ears attached to their heads. the human story: another white man, worse than the rest, shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard. tarzan won't show them the way, so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed. tarzan intercedes, and the bad guy shoots himbut, of course, he survives and returns to save jane. everybody else dies, holt and the bad guy and every single one of their "boys." people are expendable, especially africans, and there doesn't seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them. this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes. there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude, and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing. apparently one of weismuller's friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes, and not maureen o'sullivan. she, however, moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears (plus a bikini top), showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip. they still don't need to talk a lot. they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities. no wonder they're happy.

i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.after the original film, we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan & jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.the skin show in this film is off the charts. in addition to jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan. (although it is not o'sullivan, but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene) weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.it's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry. although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.

as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies. unlike others however, i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle. in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.this occurs when harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. the pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle. the film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers. in addition sexy jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! not to be missed an adventure classic.

considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films, i have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining. one thing: it's the longest of the series that i've seen at 105 minutes. i've only seen six of them but this was longer than i'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long.nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. the only things missing are color and stereo sound. the primitive special-effects don't bother me, as that was all that they had back in the 1930s.among some, this film is most noted for one thing: skin! "jane" never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays' code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made. her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o'sullivan possessed. the nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by a longshot. the woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all, whoever it was.there is plenty of action in here. up to the finale, it was not overdone, either. the ending went on for 15 minutes, though, and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch.still, this movie offers about everything - except "boy" (their adopted son) - you'd want to see in a tarzan film, even o'sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times. with her pair of "lungs," that was no problem.

there's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke. once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance. maureen o'sullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie. weismuller is solid as well. highly recommended.

the release of tarzan the ape man, in 1932, caused a sensation. it may be hard to believe, 70 years later, but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix, or the lord of the rings has achieved, at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment. tarzan became an instant pop icon, the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about, and every man wished he could be. the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs, who, while he'd agreed to mgm's creative liberties, and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks, felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character (with no plans to allow him to 'grow') was unfaithful to his vision (he would start a production company, and soon be making his own 'tarzan' films). mgm, realizing the value of it's newest 'star', knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original...and tarzan and his mate delivered!the film had an interesting back story; cedric gibbons, mgm's legendary art director, had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel, prior to the release of tarzan the ape man, despite the fact that he'd never directed before (the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact, and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film...and they wanted to keep their oscar-winning department chief happy). gibbons, a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist, loved the freedom of pre-code hollywood, and decided to have tarzan and his mate 'push the envelope' to the limit...tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim, and jane would appear topless through most of the film. maureen o'sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death, in 1998, that while a double was used for the swim, she trusted the studio, and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top...but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples, and the idea was abandoned (the film shot those days would be worth a fortune!) she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent, flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim', and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative, very thin, and open at the sides...and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the hays office, and the self-censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry.mgm yanked gibbons from the production (the 'official' reason given was his workload as art director), and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director, to appease the critics...although james c. mckay actually directed the film, as conway was busy on 3 other projects, including viva villa!the film incorporated the best elements of the original (safaris, murderous tribes, tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane), and actually improved on the storytelling. harry holt (neil hamilton), from the first film, returns to africa for ivory from the 'elephants' graveyard', and to try to seduce jane into returning to england, with gifts of silk dresses, underwear, and perfume. he brings with him martin arlington (paul cavanagh), a crack shot and inveterate womanizer, who sneers at holt's chivalrous pursuit of jane, and stalks her as a potential 'conquest', to be had by any means (including killing tarzan, if and when he can get away with it without being seen).tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane, and puts his foot down, refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard. arlington finds his opportunity, catching the ape man alone, and shoots him, then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise. now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle, and she can direct them to the graveyard, before her long voyage back to england, comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic arlington. but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group...can tarzan, being nursed back to health by his ape 'family', recover in time to save jane?while stock footage is again used extensively, the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent, and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits, tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'tarzan' film, as well as a sexiness that even bo derek's blatantly erotic tarzan, the ape man couldn't touch. johnny weissmuller was in peak condition, physically, maureen o'sullivan was never more beautiful, and 'africa' never looked more romantic, and dangerous.tarzan and his mate was a triumph (although it would be drastically edited for many years), and remains the classic of the series, to this day!

when i started watching the show i said "oh, no! it's as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody!". and indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.but this is where the resemblance stops. the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few. the magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the holy grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. however, this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script.i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with animes that i liked more, but were from other genres, i have to say that i was very pleased.

this anime seriously rocked my socks. when the anime first opened itself, i felt it was too slow; the story wasn't quite moving forward, and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead. once he learns more about tracing, and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself, the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together. it was fantastic.additionally, i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop, in the real world. there wasn't any stupid completely obvious things going on; the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch, but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on. a few of the "surprise" people that show up (gilgamesh?) seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another, meaning we didn't have "generic bad-ass a" being replaced by "generic bad-ass b" as soon as a died.anddd, i loved the music. the opening music rocked, and the finishing theme from the final episode just...seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more. good job, type-moon!

fate/stay night is an animated series inspired by a h-game. somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff. it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection.(you'll understand once you see all the episodes).despite a relatively slow start (the producer took his time on presenting the characters) things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid-series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat.the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years. the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on. shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city.he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju (holy mark) to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield, saber. his first contact with saber left him stunned "such immeasurable beauty ...i was at a lost for words". you mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot. fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, it offers excellent character and relationship development. it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate. the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals (not similar to the linear type other series use) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal, from under the mask of perfection, flawed characters.the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such. you shouldn't watch fsn thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact, just remember that this is adventure/fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can. the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath.

i have to agree with everyone else that has posted.i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you, whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling i got when watching it, and it does make me cry(such a happy yet sad feeling). i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience.i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research(and watch the ending a few more times) and i found all my answers and a whole lot more. i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime, it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more.(i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime)i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely. i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story, well built characters(some mysterious)and a bit of fantasy action.also, even though this was based on a h-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way.(i have no problem with mature anime, in most cases i prefer it)

when i first heard about this series on animetv,i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen,this one tops it all off. i had to see this show,and that is what i really did. when i got the first volume of this show,it was the best. i really liked the animation,and all the fight scenes were awesome. i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber,and archer and of course i also like illya. and of course,all the episodes on the volumes were interesting,and very cool. another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie(famous for transformers,and others) playing the voice of berserker. he does have a cool character. and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume. so if you to see something good,then see this show,it's the best.

i've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! i haven't been this interested in an anime series since neon genesis evangelion. this series is actually based off an h-game, which i'm not sure if it's been done before or not, i haven't played the game, but from what i've heard it follows it very well.i give this series a 10/10. it has a great story, interesting characters, and some of the best animation i've seen. it also has some great japanese music in it too!if you haven't seen this series yet, check it out. you can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there, it's straight out of japan.

despite the patronage of george lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in "lumage" (a combination of animation through live action cut-outs) is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday. brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape-shifting dog ralph (one of a duo of bumbling, rejected heroes), synonamess botch (the hilariously foul-mouthed villain) and rod rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept: frivoli vs. murkwood or, the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares. in this context, the mor-infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do. it's a real pity, therefore, that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy-looking boot (culled from a tv screening) of the uncensored version  there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its vhs release  since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd. interestingly, both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities.

a lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80's music. this epitomizes the 80's desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work. personally i liked greensleeves and the other harsher characters. they had some of the more amusing lines.

you'll probably never see it, but the uncut version is about 50% better than the one you can buy. put it another way: once you've seen it in its original form, the current version is only half as good.it's still wildly creative and sick, a total success on so many levels.

this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today, if it weren't for advances in cgi. and that's just to say that he'd be forgotten, too, if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since 1983. _twice..._ has got the same wit, imagination, and sense of real excitement that you'd find in a pixar flick, only executed under the restrictions of the medium c. 1983. innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels. it should be spoken of in the same breath with _spiritited away_ and _toy story_.

one of the most unheralded great works of animation. though it makes the most sophisticated use of the "cut-out" method of animation (a la "south park"), the real talent behind "twice upon a time" are the vocal characterizations, with lorenzo music's (carlton from tv's "rhoda") woody allen-ish ralph-the-all-purpose-animal being the centerpiece. the "accidental nightmare" sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed.

ralph and mumford, misfits in their own land, get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch. twice upon a time is the story of them, the characters they meet, and their struggle to set things right. with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business, this offbeat movie hits the mark.the animation process, while similar to that of the cut out "south park" style, is much smoother and far more three-dimensional. if i didn't know that the animation was this style, i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink. if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx, please do! you won't really miss anything if you don't, but if you do, you will get much more out of the experience!

ok - as far as the 2 versions of this movie. there were 2 people involved in the making - john korty and bill couterie (george was just the producer - he really didn't have any kind of say so in the film - just helped with money) - the 'adult' version was made possible by bill couterie. john korty didn't like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). thanks to ladd films going under, they didn't advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for "the right stuff", hoping it would pull them through;... and it didn't. so, this movie never really had a chance. when "twice" made it to cable (hbo) - they showed the reels with bill's version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore (did you notice how the 'adult' version wasn't on for very long?). showtime got the 'clean' version. the version on the videotape and laser-disc is the version approved by john (who holds more power than bill). it's a pity, really, as the 'adult' version is actually better and does make more sense. but it's very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd (or any other format short of bootleg). sorry to disappoint everyone. i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club (still have numerous items from the movie - used to own a letter-boxed version of the 'adult' version, but it was stolen - only have a partial hbo copy of it now). 8 stars to the 'adult' version - 5 to the 'clean' version. any other questions, just ask.

beside the fact, that in all it's awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations, this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in it's best! paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it. as usual a woman concieling her true intentions. the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brother.the scenes in 'wiking land' are just as i remember it from my early time travels. - to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection.i recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill.-odin-

a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck."mirage" is obviously inspired by spielberg's "duel" and craven's "the hills have eyes".still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.the film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.b.g.steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10.

i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). i don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (todd schaefer, kenny johnson and kevin mcparland). i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. it's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. but where do i find it? how can i download it?

well, this was one of those films i caught on the off-chance, and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time... if, like myself, you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm (i.e. not just another glut of generic sequels) then i think you may enjoy this. when the bad guy eventually turns up in person, he was definitely not what i expected to see! all in all, i wouldn't go out of your way for this one, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, i guess. i'd give it 6.5 out of 10.

this movie, which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less, moving vehicle, has quite the quirky little personality to boot. the cast of seven (although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert (an odd but effective choice of setting), who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. it predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("the trip", "joy ride", "jeepers creepers") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. the killer himself is quite creepy, and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire, as scanty and stonewashed as it may be). director bill crain does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast tries their absolute best. there's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough t&a from a couple of the girls to please t&a fans. overall, this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video. highly recommended.

mirage (1990) is a very rare horror/chiller from 1990, released here in the uk on the "new world video" label.it's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck!!! this film has some creepy scenes, and some gore here and there, but i have to say that the acting was so lame, even by low budget standards! but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it, and i never fell asleep or turned it off, which is always a good sign! i nearly gave this movie 6/10, but seeing as it built up steam along the way, had some good moments of gore and suspense, had some good nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too! i'll give it 7/10.

bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts. the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons; - a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most post-halloween genre pieces. but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect. just as wally koz's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family, mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director. looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature. but despite fairly good distribution across the globe, the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market. nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert, which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location. with that said though, i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly. four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way. chris (jennifer mcallister) and her boyfriend greg (kenny johnson) meet up with amusing new age hippies trip (kevin mcparland) and mary (nicole anton) at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune-like wilderness. greg's older brother kyle (todd schaefer) and his buxom girlfriend bambi (laura albert) soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave. kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget. sound like a motive for a massacre? well what did you expect? before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve. will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel? i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature. i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others. mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography, so your guess is as good as mine. judging by the credible work behind the camera, i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience. the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain, and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary. r. christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome, and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent 18 rating. a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre. one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade, while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck! there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional. we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters. but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey, i didn't quite know what to expect. thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically.there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast. the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b.g. steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse. the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential. the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation, which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs. watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film-making at it's freakiest.mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite. when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck, you have to say that they did a damn good job. the flaws are numerous, but never detract credibility from the net result. unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy. if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store, then make sure you pick it up. recommended.

"in april 1946, the university of chicago agreed to operate argonne national laboratory, with an association of midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research. argonne thereby became the first "national" laboratory. it did not, however, remain at its original location in the argonne forest. in 1947, it moved farther west from the "windy city" to a new site on illinois farmland. when alvin weinberg visited argonne's director, walter zinn, in 1947, he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site. when zinn described a heavy-water reactor operating at one-tenth the power of the materials testing reactor under design at oak ridge, weinberg joked it would be simpler if zinn took the oak ridge design and operated the materials testing reactor at one-tenth capacity. the joke proved unintentionally prophetic."the s-50 plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns. it was built next to the k-25 power plant, which provided the necessary steam. much less efficient than k-25, the s-50 plant was torn down after the war.concerned that the atomic energy commission research program might become too academic, lilienthal established a committee of industrial advisers, and during a november visit to oak ridge, he discussed with clark center, manager of carbide & carbon, a subsidiary of union carbide corporation at oak ridge, the possibility of the company assuming management of the laboratory.prince henry (of prussia) arriving in washington and visiting the german embassy (1902). evidently, with prince henry of prussia according to the principles of science and its dangers their were already concerns with the applications of new science with military applications. the hohenzollern (1902/ii), "kaiser wilhelm's splendid yacht at the 34th st. pier, new york. taken at the exact moment of prince henry's arrival, and the raising of the royal standard." if royalty knew of these necessary precautions to citizen welfare then what was the necessity of the warfare wwi and wwii. the quality of management control i presume?thus, did the commandos of operation swallow volunteer for a military mission, or a business plan, based on the security principles of laboratory management? because supposedly their were no survivors, and the ones who were caught in europe ordered to be executed. of the 400 man commando team the survivors who were captured were executed under orders of the german army against subversion, and espionage acts of the state of germany. the führer no. 003830/42 g. kdos. okw/wfst, führer hq, 18 oct. 1942, (signed) adolph hitler; translation of document no. 498-ps, office of u.s. chief of counsel, certified true copy kipp major, declassified dod 5200.30 march 23, 1983, reproduced at the u.s. national archives.the oss society® 6723 whittier ave., 200 mclean, va 22101

i've received this movie from a cousin in norway and had to convert it from norwegian to american format with a copied video. comparing this film (1948) with the heroes of telemark (1965), kampen om tungtvannet (the struggle for the heavy water) casts the saboteurs themselves, playing their respective roles, though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in norway's struggle for freedom in later campaigns. the plot is in four languages: norwegian along with french, german and english (complete with norwegian subtitles).impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle. french scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from norsk hydro in vemork to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness. simultaneously, the nazis, too, were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon. the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by invading norway, and through secret codes, their man carefully eluded nazi spies on his trip to oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance. he was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner, but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him. this clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the nazis later forced down in hamburg.however, the invasion of norway on the morning of april 9, 1940, the nazis took over norsk hydro and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action. professor leif trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young norwegians; the "swallow" and "gunnerside" groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in vemork. this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation, including the sinking of the ferryboat after the nazis abandoned norsk hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to berlin.the quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film. i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history.

this movie is a half-documentary...and it is pretty interesting....this is a good movie...based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan, norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany.this movie isn't perfect and it could have been a bit better... the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves!!!if you're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that's worth a look!!

by saying that,i mean that this is not a well made movie but it's a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far.and if you are a ww2 buff then this is a treat for you,cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie. it's theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary.me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over-human heroes of the second world war,and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next generations.cause nowadays kids doesn't read books,they watch movies.so if you want a action extravaganza,rent private ryan,this is the truth about lingering pain,outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost.

it tries to be the epic adventure of the century. and with a cast like shô kasugi, christopher lee and john-rhys davies it really is the perfect b-adventure of all time. it's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had. big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. this on the other hand, just has the real feeling. you just can't hate it. i think it's an okay adventure movie. and i really love the soundtrack. damn, i want the theme song.

this was a really cool movie. it just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. it traverses continents in seconds, people get shot and nothing happens to them, swords set on fire, samuari fight on sinking galleons, david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude. i enjoyed this movie but i like s**t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s**t movie that just kicks ass. if you like battlefield earth you'll love this film, its swashbuckling, its fast, its silly, its samuaraitastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it also looks as if it was made in 1972

for someone who remembers jane in the daily mirror strip cartoon, viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia. in that context it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. the plotline is also a bit limp for today's audience, but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well. jane, you must remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years, created to boost the morale of the troops. she gave a double meaning to the "strip" in strip cartoon.the story has something in common with the tales of edgar rice burroughs and rider haggard. the theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era, a bunch of bumbling nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling englanders, and set in the african jungle of course.for jane fans, a must see. for the rest of you, a damp squib.

what an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hrs to kill, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him, i still liked it. the music by a.r.rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it.

a most awaited film of the year 2002. after three and half years of hibernation,rajini has acted in this movie. the hype for this film was toooooo high..this is not a typical rajini film, in this film he gives some spiritual messages also. but it also includes typical rajini actions,style,songs etc. its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also.i will rate this movie as good instead of excellent because of the screenplay. its a must watch movie. dont miss it!

icy and lethal ace hit-man tony arzenta (a divinely smooth and commanding performance by alain delon) wants to quit the assassination business, but the dangerous mobsters he works for won't let him. after his wife and child are killed, arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths. director duccio tessari relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a properly serious and no-nonsense tone throughout, stages the stirring shoot-outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip-snorting brio, and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence. delon's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engrossing proceedings. this film further benefits from sterling acting by a bang-up cast, with praiseworthy contributions by richard conte as wise mafia kingpin nick gusto, carla gravini as arzenta's supportive lady friend sandra, marc porel as arzenta's loyal pal domenico maggio, anton diffring as ruthless, calculating capo grunwald, and lino troisi as the venomous gangster rocco cutitta. silvano ippoliti's glossy cinematography boasts several graceful pans. gianni ferrio's funky score hits the get-down groovy spot. erika blanc and rosalba neri pop up briefly in nifty bit parts. better still, there's no filler to speak of and we even get a decent dab of tasty gratuitous female nudity. the startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut. a solid and satisfying winner.

by 1945, and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces, errol flynn’s hold over u.s. box office had started to decline so, in spite of the increased burden of waning looks, he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name: the swashbuckler. the first of these was a good one actually – adventures of don juan (1948) – but it also proved to be his last big-budget hollywood starring vehicle. the rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over europe: in england for kim (1950), the master of ballantrae (1953) and the dark avenger (1955), in france for adventures of captain fabian (1951) and italy for the aborted the story of william tell (1953) and the little-seen crossed swords (1954). however, hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers ‘a’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak… still, the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and, while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self, his red-headed leading lady maureen o’hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady. anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger-than-life starring vehicles, so here he is typically seen as the baddie – the pirate captain roc brasiliano, a role he attacks with gusto. like the black shield of falworth (1954) – a viewing of which preceded this one – against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels.for all i know, this might well have been the very first pirate movie i’ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today’s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about! as i said earlier, against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it’s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same. nowadays, the amorous persistence of the child-like indian princess (alice kelley) towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it – despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk (1940) and the black swan (1942), to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars – is briskly paced and reasonably engaging. incidentally, the film would later go on to be remade as the king’s pirate (1967) with doug mcclure! for what it’s worth, the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and, as a matter of fact, against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out “pirates of the golden age movie collection” set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer’s girl (1950; with yvonne de carlo), doule crossbones (1951; with donald o’connor) and yankee buccaneer (1952; with jeff chandler)! value for money, perhaps but, so far, i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources; even so, if the mood strikes me in future, i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk’s mutiny (1952), the afore-mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga (1961).

being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in maureen o'hara (what an exquisite beauty!) and anthony quinn, i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure.hollywood at its best!

alain delon visits swift, sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit-man in the duccio tessari thriller "big guns" after they accidentally murder his wife and child. tessari and scenarists roberto gandus, ugo liberatore of "a minute to pray, a second to die," and franco verucci of "ring of death" take this actioneer about a career gunman for the mob right down to the wire. indeed, "big guns" is rather predictable, but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings. alain delon of "the godson" is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter. richard conte of "the godfather" plays a sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the hatchet with the delon character, but the rest of his hard-nosed associates want the hit-man dead. like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, "big guns" subscribes to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. interestingly, the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. tessari does not waste a second in this 90-minute shoot'em up. apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father, the worst thing that takes place occurs in an automobile salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a junked car. ostensibly, "big guns" is a rather bloodless outing, but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama. only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact. tessari stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets. the photography and the compositions are excellent.

a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is. lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie some real zip. and there's some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads. quinn makes a good villain also, although his role is completely overshadowed.but don't be fooled by maureen o'hara's tough broad role, this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era. you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made, but it's still hard to get past. for all the heroism and gruesomely adult off-screen situations, this is still little more than an adolescent good time.

"against all flags" is every bit the classic swashbuckler. it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one, the damsel in distress is, well, not really in distress. as spitfire stevens, maureen o'hara is at her athletic best, running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period. anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain roc brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for brian hawke (flynn). for the classic adventure fan, "against all flags" is a must-see. while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol flynn's earlier work (captain blood and the sea hawk, for instance), it is still a greatly entertaining romp.

excellent pirate entertainment! it has all the good ingredients to keep one's attention -- an absorbing tale of intrigue, a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens (maureen o'hara) who's attracted to the irresistible mr. hawke (errol flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. they make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh!anthony quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs. macgregor, the protector of young princess patma (alice kelley).there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. lots of action too of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps of errol flynn (robin hood on board ship!). from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o'hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here.very enjoyable movie.

tony arzenta, a sicilian hit-man or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers do not agree.in terms of content, this highly enjoyable action movie doesn't have one; in terms of sheer amusement, it is funit is very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, the car chases are notable. "arzenta" is an unpretentious ,yet very likable filmmuch better than the current hollywoodian trash that gets the same label. it comes from delon's rather short flirting with the italian b cinema of the '70s. it carefully uses delon's tough guy persona, belonging to the gallery of bad-ass thugs that he made in his youth. i enjoyed very much the fact that delon made this film, that he had a role in a good eurocrime flick.the score is very fine, with a good introductory songmaking felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work,where the musical art has an important part.in tony arzenta/ big guns/ no way out the very appealing erika blanc (31 years in '73) appears as an unnamed hooker.meanwhile, arzenta's girlfriend, sandra,is played by carla gravina (a starlet that practically left the movies after '75)."arzenta" is interestingly filmedan ambitious visual conception, some expressionistic peculiar angles. the movie was directed by the prolific duccio tessari,the one who made also zorro (the delon comedy).needless to mention that these two films,tony arzenta (1973) and zorro ,are very unlike.the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie--the second is a lighthearted comedy,more kindred to a spoof,though remarkably coherent and skilfully made.duccio tessari directed films like kiss kiss... bang bang (1966),sons of satan ,the bloodstained butterfly ,¡viva la muerte... tua! ,tough guys (1974),safari express (1976) ,etc..

stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven bloodbath. also cheesy, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. it reminded me a lot of the big heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event, and the girl comes around to the good guy's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy. it's sad there's no gloria grahame but so fantastic that it's alain delon and not glenn ford. could there be anyone as beautiful as alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? yet he's totally tough and icy cool. no one nowadays can touch him--though someone like jude law could try i guess. hard for any girl to look good with him. the music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases (and those aren't generally my cup of tea)--especially one willy nilly one in the woods. people also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion, for instance in a junkyard cruncher. but beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off. more creativity, excitement and freshness in that "forgotten" movie than most of what i've seen lately.

this movie surprised me, it had good one-liners and laughs, + a nonstop action-packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions. this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns. the plot is solid despite what others may think, it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end. in conclusion; this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on.

this movie has everything you want from an action movie. explosions,shootouts,bad guys and worse guys. it is fun to see james belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss "the skipper. does this sounds cheesy. of course it is. but boy,did i have fun watching this movie. it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage that is made nowadays. if you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store. you could argue about the twists being predictable. but the fast pace of this movie doesn't give you time too think too much of them,which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist. but more about the journey to that moment. only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie. they probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other. pure fun!

what a good film! made men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns. james belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters , hillbillies his wife and the local sheriff( timothy dalton).you wont be disappointed, jump on board and enjoy the ride. 8 out of 10

this movie surprised me in a good way. from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller, even though it was somewhat exciting.there's a lot of nice one-liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci, he does a great job. the rest of the cast ain't half-bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat.the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film. things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things. if you don't pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it.louis morneau isn't all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the movie.made men is well worth checking out.

i bought this movie a few days ago, and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film. but when i popped it into the dvd-player, it surprised me in a very good way. james belushi plays very well as bill "the mouth" manuccie. but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff. the 'end' scene, in the house of bill is very excellent, good camera-work, nice dialogues and very good acting. bill "the mouth" manuccie has stolen 12 million dollars from the mafia. together with his wife he lives in south-carolina in a witness protection program. but the mafia tracks him down, and wants the 12 million dollar. bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out, himself.

i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy dalton's james bond and although it wasn't his deserved '3rd bond outing' it was a laugh. belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely, but was probably underused. his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men. the other brit in it was a bit shocking, but overal it was a laugh.

great entertainment from start to the end. wonderful performances by belushi, beach, dalton & railsback. some twists and many action scenes. the movie was made for me! funny lines in the screenplay, good music. dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as "redneck-villain". i must recommend this film to every action-adventure fan! 10/10

i am going to go out on a limb, and actually defend "shades of grey" as a good clip-show episode, which delved into the life and death struggle of commander william thomas riker who was battling a terminally fatal disease.the scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood riker was in such as when he was reliving his romantic episodes such as "11001001," "angel one," and "up the long ladder." tragic moments were highlighted such as tasha's death in "skin of evil," as well as elements of pulse-pounding danger in "heart of glory," "conspiracy," and the aforementioned "skin of evil." riker also exhibited courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as "an ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake once...after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." this episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of will riker under extreme duress. and, yes, i am biased in my opinion in proclaiming "shades of grey" as a solid episode, because at the time of its original airing, my face was covered in sweat, wondering whether or not riker would pullout of it alive and live to see other great, galactic, outerspace adventures beyond the final frontier...of course, in subsequent years, i seem to have formed a singular opinion of this particular episode...but, if an award should go for "the best clip-show episode in the history of television," then i believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect.

i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible. i am attempting to watch all things star trek. this is month 3 and i am now on season 3 of tng and i have already gone thru ds9 in its entirety. star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved."shades of grey" is the first recap episode in the tng series. having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but i noticed how a couple of them were re-shot because the film looked better. season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me - and the actors looked silly, like they didn't fit in their own skins.the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in riker's life on the enterprise up until this point. the data and riker scene in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker's authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon. then the admiral kicks his a$$ but good. this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy, great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies! at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi. up until this point they have mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it. let the record show that the st wiki - memory alpha claims that imzadi means "first" and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one. this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come.here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/imzadi by this point in the series, production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the sci-fi behemoth it was destined to become. watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides. they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows. a ds9 movie would have been nice too.

this isn't the best bigfoot ever made, but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies, mostly showing on the sci-fi channel, this is quality stuff. it has some action, some humor, decent f/x and bigfoot. cg is used, but so are some practical f/x, which i like.overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horror/sci-fi and need a fix. it's better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled.the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. expect a bit of a lul as the characters are "developed", but know that things will pick up. if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two.

"sasquatch hunters" actually wasn't as bad as i thought.**spoilers**traveling into the woods, park rangers charles landon, (kevin o'connor) roger gordon, (matt latimore) brian stratton (david zelina) spencer combs, (rick holland) and his sister janet, (stacey branscombe) escort dr. helen gilbert, (amy shelton-white) her boss dr. ethan edwards, (gary sturm) and assistant louise keaton, (juliana dever) to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area. when they make camp, the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area. when members of the group start to disappear, they start to wander through the woods to safety. it's discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings, and the team band together to survive.the good news: this wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half-way point, when the creature attacks. that is a masterful series of scenes, as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature, and the suspense throughout the entire play-out is extremely high. the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts, heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance. also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off-screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly. they really do add much to make this part so creepy, as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard. it's quite effective, and works well. it's quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace, as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action. one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing. as a man is running through the forest from the creature, he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it. raising his hands to holler to them for help, the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily. it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing.the bad news: there was only a couple things to complain about here, and one is a usual complaint. the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi, which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might've had. the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen. it's so distracting that it's a shame a little more work wasn't put into it. i've complained about this one a lot, and is something that really should be done away with, as it doesn't look that realistic and is quite fake. another big one is the off-screen kills in here. very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away, and then finding the bloody body afterward. it's quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward. otherwise, i don't really have much of a problem with this one, as everything else that's usually critiqued about this one didn't really bother me, but it is called on for others beyond this stuff.the final verdict: i kinda liked this one, but it's still not the best sasquatch movie ever. it's not supposed to be taken seriously, and if viewed that way, it's actually quoit enjoyable. fans of these films should give this one a look, and those that like the sci-fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well.rated r: graphic language, violence and some graphic carcasses

rented the movie as a joke. my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters. it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better. no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant. i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well. "thanks for the jeep, tom!" whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made. in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy.

after seeing dick tracy in the 6.99$ bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies. i was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. the movie moves along well, it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty, but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna. i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city. madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try. i don't think you will be disappointed. and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino, james caan, kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others.

at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed. it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast. at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup.that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player. in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay.the city's top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition. the film opens with him rubbing out lips manlis's henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat. but caprice's moves are making him a target for tracy.in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself. will our hero sort out this thicket of crime?the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious. when people like al pacino, dustin hoffman, paul sorvino, william forsythe, r.g. armstrong get themselves outrageously made-up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham, you've got to love this film.al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor, but any of these guys could have, it's only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time. only beatty plays it completely straight, the others all seem to play off of him. dick tracy won oscars for best art&set design, best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna, sooner or later. the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun. as for madonna, the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoney.before this film, dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials. the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl. can you believe a cast like bing crosby, bob hope, frank sinatra, dinah shore, jimmy durante, judy garland, frank morgan, and the andrews sisters? try and find a recording of that gem.until then warren beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely.

dick tracy wasn't the best for many comic book fans, because they wanted something with blood like batman. dick tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun. warren beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers. i have liked dick tracy since i was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. this is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children. al pacino is like the jack nicholson in batman and plays big boy caprice with zest. madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn't play the same boy toy she represents. like i said, no blood, obscenities, sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody.

i still liked it though. warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero. what saves this movie is the set, the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script. i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action, or plot but i got very little. the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film. the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna. she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad. the movie at some points just stood still. you expected something more and you got nothing. al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good. he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy. it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman, and warren beatty in a film other than isthar. i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things. the thing about this movie is it is good, but it could have been so much better. i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are incredible, the writing is only fair, and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway. spoileri especially thought the finale was not big enough. it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang. the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway.the costumes and makeup were flawless as well. the facial makeup for the villains was great. beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character. still, this is a good movie that could have been much much more. it is to me better than batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time. of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross.

dick tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by chester gould. he is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains, ranging from all types of visually original characters such as flattop to the blank to big boy caprice. (these villains became so popular in the 40's that warner bros. created their own take on the tracy-style villains in such cartoons as daffy duck) tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up-to-date technology advances (notably the wristwatch communicator), which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie. the music was done wonderfully by danny elfman, and the original songs by madonna were interesting, but they were not the high point for her career. it's weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments, the film feels so much like batman because of elfman's memorable sound to his pieces.i love the tough-talking kid, pacino's acting as big boy caprice (and that chin!), madonna's take on villainy, and the cinematography and directing were impeccable. this film was very professionally made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made (warren beatty, al pacino, william forsythe, dustin hoffman, kathy bates, mandy patinkin, catherine o'hara, dick van dyke). the film was directed by beatty himself, which was interesting. it is almost like beatty saw himself as tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part.i had to give this film an 8/10 for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked (for whatever reason). there have been tons of misunderstandings over the rating of this movie on imdb, and i still don't understand why. the characters were completely original and vibrant, as was the style of the sets, wardrobe, lighting, and everything in this film. go buy it today. you will not be sorry.

this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel. the sets, costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book. this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned, the suits, the hats and the attitudes.hoffman gives comic relief as mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries, and fails, to win tracy over. this movie contains all the classic mob clichés - burying people in concrete, blowing up peoples cars, tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house.this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word, even camera angels cry out comic book. its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as spawn and the hulk. !!!you have to see this movie!!!!

love it or loathe it, it's hard to not find warren beatty's take on "dick tracy," the 1990 film adaptation of chester gould's famous comic strip, anything short of a genre classic. superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years, and may soon become a genre all on its own.beatty's film liberally uses gould's source material to full effect, shooting in all six of the strip's primary colors, and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose, seductive women a lush visual style and tone.it can be stated that the film's strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities, which i don't think can be any further from the truth."dick tracy" relishes in its look and ghastly characters, and beatty himself, who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title, is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs.other than the visual treats and oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot, and big boy caprice (al pacino, deliciously over-the-top in an oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate tracy in one well-planned move, but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him.tracy, meanwhile, is juggling his relationship with tess trueheart (glenne headly), who as her name would have it, remains faithfully by his side and cares for the kid (charlie korsmo), who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero. tracy's fidelity to tess is tested by the tempting advances of breathless mahoney (madonna), who is also big boy's main squeeze. at the same time that all of this is going down, things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town, and decides to play both sides against the middle.the performances are good, as beatty's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material, as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects. pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that's truly standout from the rest."dick tracy" is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre. i think that if chester gould was still alive, he would be proud of warren beatty's take on his beloved crime-fighting detective.8/10

usually, when we use the word "escapist", we mean it negatively; warren beatty's big screen version of "dick tracy" proves that "escapist" can be good. this is truly one entertaining movie. as the eponymous, yellow-clad, fearless title character, beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses.from there, the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves. tess truehart (glenne headly) is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be; breathless mahoney (madonna) is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable; big boy caprice (al pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. other characters include the speech-challenged mumbles (dustin hoffman), the over-musical 88 keys (mandy patinkin), and the kid (charlie korsmo). charles durning, james caan, dick van dyke, estelle parsons, catherine o'hara, seymour cassel, paul sorvino and kathy bates also star.oh, wait a minute. i haven't even explained the plot! the plot involves tracy trying - and failing so far - to find some way to nab big boy. simultaneously, some very bizarre events have been going on in town, the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks.of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. if warren beatty was having trouble acting his age, then he made good use of that here. "dick tracy" is one cool movie.

at the time i am writing this i see out of over 15,000 votes it has a 5.8 rating. something is wrong with that picture. personally i give it a 10. i can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is. it is a movie based on a comic book hero. this movie won more than it's share of awards. won 3 oscars. another 5 wins & 26 nominations .... right there tells me it's better than a 5.8. some great acting from some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come. if you're looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy. definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times. al pacino is great as big boy caprice.

that was great fun! i never read those chester-gould-comics but it's not necessary to know them. maybe there were some inside jokes i didn't figure out but what the eye doesn't see the heart cannot grieve over. this is such an ironic, colourful film and the actors are good-humoured all together. the setting is similar to that in the batman` movies, but not as dark and grey. okay, the story is not so original but there is a plot (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising ending.with this movie, you could play an interesting game, if you watch it with friends. don't watch the credits at the beginning and then look who's the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their make-up!

i saw dick tracy when i was very young. i didn't know who any of the actors were, and i didn't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed. i sure loved it though.warren beatty stars as the crime-fighting 1930's detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city. this time, big boy caprice (al pacino) has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney (madonna) who has her eye on tracy. it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. he or she is very unknown. plus, the famous villians are back from the comic book collection.i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative. it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child. warren beaty was just like james bond of the 1930's the way he played dick tracy.an ensemble cast of the film includes: charlie korsmo, glenn headly, william forsythe, dustin hoffman, james caan, ed o' ross, tommy lee jones, mandy patinkin, charles durning. plus more!dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. take my word for it.

most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life, ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog. the tim burton batmans had it, as did (in an even more grotesque manner) sin city. with dick tracy producer/director/star warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework. like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures- only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde- dick tracy is filled, joyfully, with archetypes and bright, primary colors, where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities. villains like the stooge, shoulders, lips, the brow, mumbles, the blank, pruneface, spud. chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles, and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass. the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously.if, at the time, movies like batman and (underrated) teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic-book outline, dick tracy is more 'old-school'. it's a story of cops and crooks, or rather a cop, detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy (al pacino, in what is arguably his biggest performance to date, and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style), but with no such luck. there's also a little kid, called simply the kid (charlie korsmo, who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would've been imagined), and tracy's love interest in tess. and then there's the nightclub 'dame' (madonna, who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance, but maybe that suits the role fine, and she sings excellently when called upon), who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her. then there's convoluted dealings with taking tracy down, and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice.meantime, as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions, dick tracy adds on the wink-and-nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes. it's a wonder to look at this world, which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers (i.e. sin city, which can be justifiably compared to beatty's film). we're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line, or whatever there is of it, in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old. i'm almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences, as story, music, detail, and a few big punches and gun-shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said, which, actually, isn't more than it needs to. and there's a heap-load of catchy dialog from the script (one of my favorites: "the enemy of my enemy is... my enemy", plus any of pacino's references to other figures in quotes).revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater (and only remembering little bits), dick tracy is a hard-boiled fantasy to the finest degree. it's filled with good cheer for the kids, and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic-book movies (i.e. pg-13 fare), and for the adults its throw-back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle. even dustin hoffman hams it up, and he barely says an audible word!

just picked this up on dvd and watched it again. i love the bright colors vs. dark imagery. not a big beatty fan, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. pacino is astounding, as always, and well, this movie marked the period where madonna was her absolute sexiest. i wish she had stuck with the "breathless" look for a while longer. charlie korsmo's first really big role, other than "what about bob?". the makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part. beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment. the cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even the streetlights et a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying, as it tends to blur a little. just wish beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel. all in all, a fun few hours.

heh, if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9, will you call me crazy? that's just to catch your attention. everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies, who seem to only know the recent blockbusters. it's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. dick tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated, in terms of technology.the negative reviews mainly complained about dt's "messed up" story. but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear, and i had no problem following it. i didn't see the comic books, yet i am not a huge us comic fan, but i appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances. maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell. but, if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together, what would you expect. i had some scratches on my head, and can't help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? the title role, although not as competent as it sounds, still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences. madonna was more express-less than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself. apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles. we can see a hybrid of scarface, michael corleone, adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh. and many thanks to make-ups.to me it's not bad at all. the surreal feeling really got me.

the opening credits make for a brilliant, atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that's full of little nods to the comic strip. all the good guys are good, all the bad guys are bad, and the film is jam-packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make-up to hi-lite their characteristics.warren beatty, as dick tracy, is the ultimate tough guy straight man, incorruptable, calm usually, always a better fighter than the other guy, and rarely one to push the limit on legality. al pacino, as "big boy" caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters. maddonna plays the kind of person she'd probably play best, breathless mahoney, a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going. gleanne headly is tracy's tough-talking, fiercely independent long-time girlfrined. and then there's the kid, a funny little street urchin tracy takes in, who models himself after his surrogate father, and saves tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up.the supporting players are a who's who of character actors. charles durning is the chief of police. dick van dyke is the district attorney, who's bribed by big boy's goons to keep him on the streets. dustin hoffman has a humorous turn as mumbles, the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say. r.g. armstrong is pruneface, one of the rival gangsters big boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city. mandy patinkin is 88 keys, the piano player for breathless's show. paul sorvino plays lips manlis, breathless's former benefactor until big boy gives him "the bath." james caan wears relatively little make-up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with big boy's grand plan. william forsythe and ed o'ross are big boy's enforcers, flattop and itchy.this movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip, plus it is full of vibrant colors. almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds. all the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie--and then some! the matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two-dimensional, only acted in three-dimensional sets. the humor is plentiful. al pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since. big boy is kind of crazy, and kind of self-pitying. he's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our founding fathers and likening himself to great political leaders. the man with the plan, always looking for the smartest way to do business.

dick tracy is one of my all time favorite films. i must admit to those that haven't seen it. you will either really love it or really hate it. it came out a year after the success of batman. so everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. but its based on a comic strip...what did you expect? creatively, this movie is amazing! the sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. the film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. directed, produced, and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacino's evil big boy caprice and his mob of thugs. madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney. this is one of the best characters madonna has ever played. she has the best one liners i've heard! madonna fans would love it! one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. this film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public. to sum things up, this film brings out the child in all of us. it's a film that will leave you smiling at the end.

i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona. this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story. if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy b&w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition. the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it's meant to be. i personally find madonna's musical element to be a major part of this film-the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i've listened to often over the years, it's just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era. in my mind, madonna's finest moment both on-screen but especially musically. this is sure to bring out the "kid" in you.

dick tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date. the movie has the same feel as the comic book, staying true to the color scheme. the batman series has climbed, fallen, climbed and fallen again. dick tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy. the good guys triumph over evil, without blood and gore to get the point across. al pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of big boy caprice and madonna is memorable as breathless. but the best job by far is warren beatty who just epitomizes dick tracy just as he did with clyde barrows. i can't wait until it comes out on dvd on april 2, 2002, my tape is wearing thin.

don't look for an overdeveloped plotline here....just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one. a gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon character's villains in this live action comedy, which features incredible makeup and set design, not to mention knockout performances from beatty, madonna, and pacino. great fun for kids and adults alike.*** out of ****

i never attended the midnight showing of a movie before "dick tracy" came out.i still have the "t-shirt ticket" i had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and, like that shirt, "dick tracy" has stuck with me ever since.if you've seen the movie, the sharp visuals, bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain. it's a wonder to behold.as director/star/co-writer/producer, beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here, taking a familiar american icon and re-creating him for a whole new era. still set in the '30s, "tracy" has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do. i've lost track of how many times i've watched "tracy" and i still catch something new every time i do.the others are all top notch, starting with pacino's big boy caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even madonna's breathless mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment, she can act (gasp!). but there's still such themes touched on as the necessity of family, keeping true to one's self, good versus evil, even machiavellian themes are explored. odd for a comic strip film, but hey, it works.all in all, "dick tracy" is a classic unto itself. compared with other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. it's a good, strong film that doesn't depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity to make its point. there's a lesson to be learned here.ten stars. great scott!

if dick tracy was in black and white, the pope wouldn't be religious. giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie, we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic-strip world, and it's one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances (al pacino is astonishing) and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume design. using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before. and there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster-movie genre, pratically extinct from modern cinema. overall, i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already-seen formulas. 7 out of 10.

"dick tracy" is one of our family's favorites -- the actors are great -- the art direction is exceptional -- the music is magic. it's not supposed to be "to kill a mockingbird" -- it's a fun experience.stephen sondhemim's songs are stellar: "back in business" is energetic, "sooner or later" is just right, "what can you lose" is haunting -- even tunes like "live alone and like it" add to the storygot to love the giddily over-the-top performances of al pacino, dustin hoffman, glenn headly, charlie korsmo, mandy patinkin, james caan, dick van dyke, supporting villains... the list is far too long. and, yes -- even madonna and warren beatty are awesome. written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, "wait a minute -- i'm having a thought -- it's gone!"?).however, one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time -- and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer. so, if you haven't already, why not give "dick tracy" a chance -- accept it for what it is -- a sunday comic strip brought to life -- and in a wonderful way!!

i've been watching "dick tracy" for years, and as a result it's become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often. seeing it now, as an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satiric and incredibly misunderstood. about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received - other than that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of a fuss when it came out.pacino is over-the-top but to good effect as he's clearly having loads of fun. beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film, possibly, i have ever seen. just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking. the lighting, velvet overtones and smog/smoke combine to create a great effect.there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as "mumbles," and i don't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting - even the mandatory kid-character is far better than expected.overall, a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5.7/10 average on imdb. the critics' reviews are very positive (check out rottentomatoes.com) and after seeing the film once again it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from style to eccentricity.highly recommended. 4.5/5 stars.

this is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. when it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. there are literally thousands of scenes i wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.the characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. the famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing "flatop," "pruneface," "lips," "mumbles," etc.meanwhile, warren beatty and gleanne hedley are good as dick tracey and girlfriend tess truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. another good addition is charlie korsmo as the delinquent young boy dick and tess take under their wing. the colorful other characters are played by al pacino, dustin hoffman, william forysthe, paul sorvino, mandy patinkin, madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.the only negatives i found were pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. those "faults" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen.

i enjoyed albert pyun's "nemesis" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. a lot of people complain about the "confusing" plot to the first film, which is probably why "nemesis 2: nebula" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.this one gives the name of the first movie's hero, alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. she is raised by a tribe in africa. a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles, which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). it doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). there are subplots involving africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. the picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. it has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie.

this is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! i think that sue price did a great job in this film series (nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula (nemesis 2). though not a film of great value and sue price's acting skills not the best to have met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action! well, some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as terminator or predator, but that's not the point. the point is that a.puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). what a pity it hasn't shown yet on dvd :-(

since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept, but first some insider notes from a movie critic.this animated series is one of those that i grew up with, it made my childhood joyful, it made it awesome, miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days, well on to the review...talespin, or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series, it is much like chip and dale, ducktales and a lot of those old ones, so it has that weird feeling surrounding it, i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it.but in my opinion it was very great, it came with some kind of message, not that wild of a message, however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven.now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that, we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that, yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days.now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much, to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones, give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the kids i have some day, give them again...

i used to watch this show when i was a little girl. when i think about it, i only remember it vaguely. if you ask me, it was a good show. two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. also, the writing was very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i don't think i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

thanks jymn magon, for creating disney's 2 best cartoons ever. this show has improved very much over the years. as a kid, i didn't like it because i thought it was a rip-off of ducktales, which was my favorite disney thing at the time (like grandmoffromero). then later on though it was good but not great. but after reading the reviews here, i decided to give it another chance & bought the dvd set & watched the whole pilot the first day i got it, & was very pleasantly surprised. it's still my favorite episode, although the series did live up to it. and by the end of disc 1, i knew this was going to be a top tenner.the characters are so complex & charming. my favorite has got to be wildcat. he's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot. my next favorite is baloo, the best pilot on the show. i can see why 'ol jymn built the show around him. then it's kit cloudkicker. he & baloo have the best relationship in the series. after that, louie. jim cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice. after him, rebecca. she has made me laugh pretty hard, and i do believe she and baloo eventually marry. and finally(for the heroes), molly. although she's my least favorite, i still like her. i think she's a very cute character(much better than webby from ducktales). and the villains were very original. don karnage & his air pirates always crack me up, kahn is ice-cold and ruthless, and the thembrians are always at least amusing.as said before, the stories range from hilarious(time waits for no bear, romance of red chimp) to nothing short of touching(the old man & the seaduck, paradise lost), to fun, funny & exciting adventures(in search of ancient blunders & my favorite for whom the bell klangs). these are only a few of my favorite episodes. anyway, talespin is disney's best, aside from gummi bears some reasons for this? gb had a decent amount of my favorite character(cubbi), while ts didn't have enough of wildcat. but in the end talespin remains a classic. bottom line- 10/10 6th best cartoon ever.

in the year 1990, the world of disney tv cartoons was certainly at it's prime. shows like chip n dale rescue rangers, ducktales and gummi bears was already popular, and now disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the disney afternoon. that cartoon is called talespin. it's about old jungle book character baloo the bear as he gets a job in the plane business. in the series he meets kit cloudkicker, former air pirate and good cloud surfer, business lady rebecca cunningham and her hyperactive daughter molly. this series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you may not understand as a kid but understand later on in life. this is one cleverly written series and it's great to add to your dvd collection. parents, buy this for your kids rather letting them watch all of those horrible nickelodeon cartoons. if you liked talespin, then check out "darkwing duck" and "goof troop". spin it!

ahh, talespin! what can i say that hasn't already been said about this great show? nothing! this is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows i've ever encountered, live-action or animation. the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes, and some of the "mature" stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for. but not talespin.the stories are engaging and very plausible. some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie. episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike. then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays(at least, those which aren't specifically geared toward it), especially in cartoons. in the episode stormy weather for instance, kit cloudkicker decides that he's going to join an air circus, but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous. in the biggest fight of the episode, baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan, to which kit screams "no! you can't tell me what to do! your're *not* *my* *dad*!" and buries his face in his pillow. the next day he leaves for the air circus. this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays.the characters have a lot of depth to them. baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money, while good in theory, are seldom good in practice. molly is a cute little girl, but you can't let that deceive you. she can be a real hellion sometimes. kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. he doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships. watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook: he looks as though he's prepared to put it right through a pirate.in the end, it's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show #1 in my book. the relationship between baloo and kit is very real, almost father and son. this is demonstrated well in all's whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit's word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults. baloo and becky's relationship is also realistic, due to baloo's motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol' sea duck, not necessarily a desire to help rebecca. but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he'd still do jobs for rebecca.the sea duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is pretty realistically designed. the plane's functions don't change once throughout the series(continuity like that is hard to come by also), and unlike most other "super-planes" of other cartoons, it doesn't have one single weapon on board(unless you count mangoes!), and relies instead on it's cunning pilot's great skill to get out of trouble. it's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun turret, laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board. and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays. plus it's just such a darn cool design!this is definitely the best cartoon. ever. period. definitely worth all ten stars!

ever since i remember, i have loved airplanes and flying. i am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial. i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me, this was it. my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid. i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re-cite it today. it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon! it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless. i cannot get enough of this show.

along with darkwing duck this is unfairly cancelled. disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track. ed gilbert and jim cummings were perfect for the voices of louis and baloo (sounds familiar?) the theme theme tune is also catchy. out of all the villains, which are all great on their own merits, tony jay stands out as shere kahn. louis and baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book, which isn't a bad thing at all. as a matter of fact, it's quite inspirational! the animation was spot on, and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years. please bring this show back! 9/10. bethany cox

as for many on here i can't help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood, i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters.to class this work of art as a "cartoon" could never do talespin justice, in fact it's an insult to class it as a "cartoon", talespin is an animation and nothing less, it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date, when disney "pulled" it from the air little did they realise what they did and i'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since.i'll take a moment to explain, from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck, disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since, they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey's for the story's, i couldn't have my children watching the mind-numbing "cartoons" they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50% of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it, i couldn't let that happen, which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a harddrive so one day my children couldn't be corrupted by the "cartoon crap" of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin.talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it's depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today, do you see any of that content in say "ed, edd and eddie or anything else you can think of?, the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old's undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso.the next time you watch an episode of talespin; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation, even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again, the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted, even the vehicles are true to life, ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail.the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the "deliberate mistakes" or "intended mistakes" in each episode and some have two, for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say's "you're up to something baloo" and baloo replies "who, me!, i'm as innocent as a schoolboy" take a look into rebecca's eyes, i won't spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time.everyone elses comment's are bang on and 100% correct, i have nothing else to add that others haven't said already on here, disney, wake up and smell the coffee, you have been asleep for over a decade, stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing "cartoons", we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible.

"spin it!"the 90s opened up with a clever disney favorite, "talespin," the tv cartoon series that featured characters from "the jungle book." join baloo and kit cloudkicker as they fly the sea duck like you've never seen it before: out of cape suzette, to louie's, up mountains, through jungles, on water, in volcanoes, looking for adventure, looking for treasure, looking for fun, all in one action-packed cartoon adventure!!!!!this was a favorite of mine as well as my family's. this ran on the disney afternoon the entire first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the old disney channel in 1995, which i have seen on vacation once in 1996 before getting cable in march 1997.and good news: today the dvds are here!!!!! relive the fun and excitement of "dun, dun, dun, talespin!!!!!"10/10

if you are viewing this show for the first time, you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality. colorful and imaginative characters? entertaining dialogue? plots that seem to have some depth to them, even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times? i mean, this is a syndicated children's show right? this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as "pokemon", "pepper ann", "mighty morphin power rangers", and "vr troopers" (please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports, courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment). don't worry, you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980's and early 1990's. some examples of this period would be "transformers", "garfield and friends", "captain power", and "c.o.p.s." (a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox). besides these prime examples, disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids, coming up with a lineup called "the disney afternoon". aside from a dumbed-down show called "the gummi bears", early shows like "darkwing duck", "duck tales", and "chip 'n dale's rescue rangers" gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like "the little mermaid", "beauty and the beast", "the rescuers down under", and "the great mouse detective". but above all these wonders shines "talespin". the premiere of "plunder and lightning" was a two-hour thrill ride, and won an emmy. much to my delight, the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere.while i enjoy the plots and dialogue, i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters. there's rebecca cunningham, an independent female, but still fallible; kit cloudkicker, full of pre-teen angst and optimism; louie, with his loyalty and support; frank wildcat, the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original "star trek"; molly cunningham, cute and witty, but with some depth that most child characters don't have, and of course in the middle of it all, there's baloo, whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond. this is because whenever there's trouble, baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker-than-most, fastest-of-all sea duck (read: james bond's aston martin). of course every great show has to have great villains, and talespin doesn't disappoint here either. from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn, to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage, to the hilarious and inept soviet-satirized thembrians. the animation is good, the music appropriate, and the episodes are (for me) the finest that children's programming has ever had to offer. great fun for the whole family!

brilliant kung-fu scenes, loads of melodrama, peculiar footwear symbolism and an unhappy (?) end makes barefoot kid an unforgettable film.one of the silliest subtitles i've seen...

i took a chance on "hardcastle and mccormick" by purchasing the first season's worth (canadian release) from amazon. when i got it, i started with the pilot, and i was instantly hooked after that. i rated it 5 stars on amazon, and i am rating it 10 stars here. it is just that good. what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes, and of course stephen j. cannell's logo at the end of each episode, but most of all, the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case. i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion, and i enjoyed it equally. if you do not have this excellent series on disc, i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection.

hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show. yes, it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard, hunter, the a-team, etc etc etc.this show is just good clean television. the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing. they often take jabs at each other several times an episode, which adds a great deal of humor to the show. it contains several car chases in almost every episode, but, who doesn't enjoy a good car chase? especially with the coyote! i only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this!

i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it's tv movies five seconds into the picture. this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy, well-crafted mood that is established from the very start. while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver, b.c.), the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos' excellent acting.

this movie is obviously low-budget & filmed in british columbia,canada. the obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing(set in california & late 60's-80's)were well conceived.i believe this is the best & most accurate version of the zodiac killings that plagued the town of vallejo & the bay area from 1968-19? (he was never caught).edward james olmos(det. dave toschi) & george dzundza(zodiac-at the time believed to be arthur leigh allen, since cleared by dna & fingerprints)play a game of cat & mouse re-visiting crime scenes together, each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation.olmos dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing dzundza did it,still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way.dzundza totally oblivious & self absorbed(like all serial killers) to the carnage left in his wake.the only disappointment was the"over the top" ending otherwise pretty accurate.if you tire of the typical hollywood fluff or have an interest in the zodiac case,check it out.

brilliant film, the next best film to the drunken master (jackie chan). i recently bought it on an original vhs and i haven't seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then. the acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film (and many other old fashioned chinese kung-fu movies) great. the choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic. i have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but gordon liu plays san te but san te in thr return to the 36th chamber is played by a different character. it has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu.

i thought this would be a sequel to the original "36th chamber of shaolin" but actually it's more of a light-hearted "sister" to the original. gordon liu still stars as a would-be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky manchus... but this time around it's lighter and more comedic. the film centres around the local dye mill, where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new manchurian bosses. liu plays "chao", who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill. but his luck runs out, he is exposed as a fraud, and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the shaolin monastery to learn kung fu, and return to protect them.the comedy really begins at the monastery where chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted. this sets up lots of really funny moments, and lots of great fight choreography. continuing in the "36th chamber" tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting (and supremely hokey) training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons.also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building. chao is not accepted as a student at shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the "10 year restoration" of the monastery. on the dvd i bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director lau kar-leung drew from it. this is a craft many hundreds (perhaps thousands) of years old, and in hong kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large high-rises, though the west exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps. as a result of his scaffolding work, chao develops a special style of kung fu... when asked what kind it is, he hilariously replies "scaffolding kung fu!!" which he first tests during a dust-up with the monastery's abbot. in the final confrontation with the manchus, there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties.from a comedy perspective, i think it's one of the best of the kung fu genre. as a kung fu film in general, it also stands out... i recommend it to anyone!

i saw this movie once on late night t.v. and knew it was the best movie ever. this is one of the few kung-fu movies with a decent plot. the progression of the main character is seamless. the whole movie is great!

return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kung-fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood, and the protagonist gordon liu, the counterpart to the western's clint eastwood. digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest, this is "presented in shaw scope", just like the good old days.this film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.act one sets up the premise. workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. they can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. however, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. after some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like mr miyagi's style in karate kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.act three is where the fight fest begins. with cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad-nausem in hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to! return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday, so, if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?

return to the 3th chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th chamber of shaolin, in which gordon liu played shan te, a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter. in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten. he imitates the original shan te, tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses. its a classic light hearted martial arts tale, with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang. the choreography is fantastic throughout, whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon liu's performance, as are the others, particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material. the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander, more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films. but few have such a magical blend of slapstick, unique training and fighting, with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good. full of light hearted joy, its impossible not to give this the highest score.

this movie has a lot of comedy, not dark and gordon liu shines in this one. he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up. his training is "unorthodox" and who would've thought knot tying could be so deadly?? lots of great stunts and choreography. very creative!add johnny wang in the mix and you've got an awesome final showdown! don't mess with manchu thugs; they're ruthless!

i agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever! i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it! the scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast. nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks! if you like kung fu you would love this!!!

this movie is one of the many "kung fu" action films made in asia in the late '70s - early '80s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action. but unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy. when workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by manchu bullies, they hire a con-artist (gordon liu) to try to scare them off. when his attempt fails miserably, he cons his way into a shaolin temple to learn to fight for real. but instead of making him a kung-fu student, the master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. well, it turns out that while he's performing these menial tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles) that he's learning the skills to be a kung-fu expert! it's sort of like in karate kid when mr. miagi teaches daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores- "wax on, wax off" et cetera. there's lots of great comedy from beginning to end, and plenty of action at the end when gordon liu once again faces his manchu tormentors. "this time it's not just tricks- it's the real thing!" liu declares, proudly thumping his chest. if you like classic kung fu films you don't want to miss this one!

the movie only enter the cinema in indonesia this year (2007), two years after it's official release, and after many illegal dvd's had found its way to the public. apparently the popularity of the illegal dvd's lead to the release into the theaters, with still public coming to watch.the movie is a great epic, bringing japanese culture into your house in an exiting way. in a sometimes humorist way, the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, since the regular kabuki theater plays is something he finds boring.at first, the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new kabuki theater piece.the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in japanese traditions and mythology, but that doesn't matter.the way the story is told with a love for theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, makes this a great ride on the roller-coaster of japanese cinema as well as theater.let yourself go completely when you watch this movie, try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home.one critical point though: the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying. though most of it is great music, there are a few moments in the movie that i think they should have chosen some more dramatic music. but maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well.

i went to see ashura as 2005 fantasia festival kickoff. man, that was one cool kick off. the director was supposed to be in montreal for the canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, he's still in japan...oh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies.the plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original...the demons are roaming in edo in japan and swordsmans called "demon wardens" are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of ashura, the demon goddess who's sleeping and supposedly is very kick-ass.it brings us to izumo...some kind of elite swordsman called "demon slayer" and his buddy jaku who's the typical violent jealous asshole...seems boring? well now it thickens....izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the "impression" that he was the demon, he never knew, but he did killed her. so izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in kabuki theater. in a boat joyride on a nice night, izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons...for the good cause, the cause of love...and damn...the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre.izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes...he is the total package...he knows how to fight(hell yeah he knows), he's witty, he's intelligent and he has that grit. you never have to yell :"no izumo, it's a trap" the guy already knows it he has that common sense. he's really the perfect hero.as far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are pretty interesting. it's by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga. it's creamed full of special effects and nothing, at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic...it's pretty amazing. lots of colours an "unreal" photography, other than that...it's pretty straightforward...but like i said, the main character is carrying the movie a must see, a tale lead by masterful hands

japan is in serious trouble. demons have infested edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will. on top of that, the rebirth of ashura, queen of the demons, is nigh. the only thing that stands against this grave threat are the demon wardens, a fearsome group of warriors, who might just be as bad as the demons themselves.izumo is a retired demon warden, who five years ago, took up theater instead of demon slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child (in a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from dusk till dawn). one night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named tsubaki. their fortunes intertwine (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies.if you think this sounds like your typical japanese fantasy/swordplay epic, you'd be wrong. in fact, there's nothing typical about ashura. it is a hodge-podge of many different genre's of film. those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. director yojiro takita (onmyoji) juggles the genre's fairly respectfully (although, the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous, but really fun popcorn movie.to be sure, there are flaws in the film. some of the humor seems contrived, and out of place. and the acting isn't the greatest. but seriously, do you watch fantasy/swordplay/comedy films for the great acting performances?? no, we watch them for the action and the crazy cg visuals, all of which ashura has in spades. not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy.bottom line; the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic, but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action. the reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick.my rating 7 out of 10. fun popcorn movie.

set in japan, ashura is the story of demons taking over the earth. the premise is far more complicated, but the arching storyline should not be forgotten. japan is in turmoil, with demons occupying human form roaming the lands. generally speaking demons look and act like humans, but are evil. the japanese word they use is not just demons, but rather the classical form of 'ogre' which is a mythological creature of some historic stature. we're talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child-eating monsters.however in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth, which appear when put under any sort of stress. in order to save the world from demons there are demon-slayers. trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon, and who guard the passage-way between the realm of hell and that of the real world. these are the basic premises.the story begins with a festival in a local town. amid these festivities, 3 men ride in, dressed in all black, seemingly intent on doing harm. the villagers run, excepting those which are demonic in nature, who turn green-eyed and try to kill them. the demon-slayers end up killing off the majority of the demons. from here the story gets interesting. the whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortune-telling demon appears before the 3 gate-keepers, revealing the arrival of ashura. with it, comes the end of the reign of man, and begins the reign of demons. ashura however requires some form of birthing process, the first step of which occurred during the opening battle, but which won't be revealed to you until you see the film. the 3 demon-slayers are a wise old man, a powerful yet unprincipled man, and a skilled and compassionate warrior. immediately you can see the split between them, the old man wanting to stop the demons, the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego maniacal wishes and the third looking to stop the second. along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to, and believes himself to have a special relationship with. she in turn is a brigand who is good-natured, sought after by authorities. when the two finally meet face to face, he places his hand on her shoulder, and suddenly she is scathed by a mark on her shoulder. needless to say, the mark is not a good sign. what ensues is a battle for earth, a battle between both good and evil, as it should be, but also between good and good itself.the point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would. i came in thinking it would either be a fast-paced action style film with demons, or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in ringu and ju-on. i was however mistaken in the best possible way. the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play, and it plays itself out as such, combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept, an amazing narrative, and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore. many scenes are painted with luxurious dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a hollywood film. it becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away.the film makes use of some immaculate scenery and camera-work comparable to many great samurai films of our days, but adding to it a well-thought and classical plot. with great acting, great music, and thoroughly stunning scenes, its a must watch in my book.that being said, it does need the disclaimer that it is not for everyone. its not cheap thrills horror, its not balls to the wall action. its a horror style play thats been filmed. it has very much to say and takes the time to do so, flying in the face of the conventional one-liners. like japanese plays, the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene. if you can enjoy such a thing, this is a masterpiece. if your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity, then you can easily watch something else.overall, this film to me is a unique and amazing one, which keeps you riveted and amused. it has good writing, good acting, and good direction. it is all in all a solidly great film.

master director ching siu tung's perhaps most popular achievement is this series, a chinese ghost story 1-3. chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his "collecting trip" in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him. beautiful actress joey wang/wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon, a wood devil who collects human souls for herself/itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts. leslie and joey fall in love, and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans, they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives. this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness.this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung. his masterpieces include duel to the death (1983) and the swordsman series, which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes. ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere, which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost. the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen. the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has. there's plenty of wire'fu stunts, too, and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films, i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic, freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give. when people fly in these films, it means the films are not just about our world, and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form.the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm, but the problem is (again) that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally. leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm, deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement. also, the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer's mind to be interpreted and found. another negative point about the dialogue is that it's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason. that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies. people just talk and talk and it's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element. just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano; his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks, or makes other characters talk too much in his movies. this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts.otherwise, chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema, and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then. i give chinese ghost story 7/10 and without the flaws mentioned above, this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre.

i can't remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout. leslie cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that he's too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire... i had the good luck to see it on a big screen, and to find a video to watch again and again. 9/10

this is a great movie. i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink, and the skeletons chase him, but luckily he dodged them, opened the window, and didn't even notice them. xiao qian is very pretty too. & when he stuck the needle up ma wu's butt, its hysterical. and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too. then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people. then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves. the love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute together. add the comic timing, the giant tongue, and u have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention superb special effects for the 90s.

wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one, outside of the uniform positive reviews i've read. turns out, i could have never imagined this movie, because it's very close to "the bride with white hair" in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic. this walks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling. there's nothing scary about it, that's not the theme, it's really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost, who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts. so the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. this also takes place in ancient china, with wild outlandish kung fu exhibitions, and a trip to hell (more or less). some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are top rate all the way. i could watch this genre of chinese movies all day, because they are highly entertaining, great visuals, and pretty much tongue-in-cheek. and i'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also. highly recommended.

a chinese ghost story stars the late, great leslie cheung as ling choi sin, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple, where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called tsing (joey wang). when ling discovers that tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who feeds on 'chi' (life force), he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial. enlisting the help of swordsman yin (wu ma), a crazy taoist monk, ling successfully defeats the tree spirit, but must also do battle in hell against the evil lord black, to whom tsing is due to be wed.the first hong kong film that i saw which wasn't purely martial arts action, a chinese ghost story opened my eyes to the incredible world of asian fantasy horror, a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, bumbling innocent heroes, sword wielding taoist monks, monstrous spirits, and dark lords of the underworld; i instantly fell in love with the film's exuberance, energy, humour, inventiveness and visual excellence.two decades later, and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that i have seena sumptuous, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. with superb direction from siu-tung ching, excellent editing from david wu, stunning cinematography, and a whole slew of imaginative special effects (including a humongous killer tongue, a many tentacled monster, and multiple flying heads!), a chinese ghost story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.

if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it. so bad it wasn't intended to be that way. but superb anyway... go find it somewhere. whatever you do... do not miss it!!!

there's never a dull moment in this movie. wonderful visuals, good actors, and a classical story of the fight of good and evil. mostly very funny, sometimes even scary. a true classic, a movie everybody should see.

a mix of comedy, romance, music(?!), action and horror. a knockout. this is one of the reasons people rave about hong kong cinema. if you're looking for something totally original, look no further. entertainment at it's peak.

i like the good and evil battle. i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. he wasn't the smart, cocky, know it all he usually plays. he shows heart and a more humble humor. the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope.

just read the original story which is written by pu in 18th century. strikingly, the movie despict the original spirit very well, though the plot was modified tremendously. the film language, the rhythm, the special effect are all from hollywood, but still there is a chinese core. it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together. the result is pure beauty.

"chinese ghost story" is one of the most amazing hong kong films i have ever seen.it's a brilliant mix of fantasy,comedy,romance,horror and martial arts.the film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights.i love especially the fight scene between wu ma and the tree demon tongue.truly original and refreshing film and another embalmer's fine recommendation.

cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west. not to repeat other reviews here. the score is very good and moving. literally it means "dawn please never comes" - when it comes, the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever. after 24 years, joel and leslie still look great. i enjoyed joel in god of gamblers and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow.

for long time i haven't seen such a good fantasy movie, magic fights here are even better than in lotr, even considering that it's a 1987 movie and haven't computer special effects. this movie have good plot, good acting and interesting ideas. recommend everybody to see it.

once in a while, a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre. a film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come. `a chinese ghost story' falls in this category. it is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980's; possibly one of the best ever made.the filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan. the story is engrossing and original. the villains are appropriately menacing and frightening. the sets are creepy and atmospheric. there is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house. but don't let the `horror' label scare you off, if you're not a fan of the genre. this film easily fits into many different categories.the screenwriter has deftly blended the drama, comedy, horror, kung fu, and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza. `a chinese ghost story' is a beautiful epic love story told, thankfully, without the gratuitous nudity and/or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many hollywood `love stories'. those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fast-paced swordplay and `wire-fu'. if that's not enough, actors leslie cheung and wu ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy. this film offers something for every film fan.director siu-tung ching and producer tsui hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film. leslie cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. i cannot possibly think of a performer other than cheung who could have portrayed ling choi sin better (except maybe chow yun fat). joey wang is enchanting as lit su seen, the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of cheung's character. her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable. wu ma is hilarious as the cantankerous taoist who aids the young lovers.on technical level, this film is very impressive, even by today's standards. the direction is superb. i wish that today's hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like siu-tung ching rather falling back on the usual mtv video or pepsi commercial `directors'. the cinematography is gorgeous. you have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night. the special effects make-up is top-notch. in fact, most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy cgi ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films.since its release, "a chinese ghost story" has spawned two worthy sequels, a full-length animated movie, and countless imitations. none of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic, however. this film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out 10.

there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism. this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it.it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15-year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action, to the humour and even to the beautiful music score.i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk, i will certainly be adding it to my collection.

ching siu tung's and tsui hark's a chinese ghost story, aside from being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film lover's collection. the sorely missed hong kong superstar leslie cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple. while staying at the temple, he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen yin (wu ma) and hsiao hou, the tree devil, and the beautiful ghost lit sin seen, played by the lovely joey wong.to free her from the clutches of the evil tree devil, he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon.enough good things can't be said about this film. the pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe. the chemistry between the wonderfully tragic joey wong and leslie cheung (whose legendary career ended much too soon) really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life, i would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences i've ever had. much of the credit goes to wu ma in his portrayal of the mysterious swordsman yin. his over-the-top persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional hk drama. a wonderful score, lush cinematography with eye popping colors, and frenetic action pieces courtesy of ching siu tung round out this wonderful film. find a copy anywhere you can. 10/10

a masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story, it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology. the film has a simple premise: a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt. of course, it happens to be haunted as well.what i wasn't expecting the first time i saw this film is that it's one of the most touching love stories i've ever seen; that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches. unlike some films of asian cinema, a chinese ghost story isn't hard to swallow for those that aren't versed in chinese culture. indeed, it plays on timeless, cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance.think evil dead 2, if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. this film is for real, despite being overlooked by many. it's absolutely among the best i've ever seen. it's ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres, and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere, is nothing short of fantastic. highly recommended, 10/10.

though i'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty. the great, tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky taoist. cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk, who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number. perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit, truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive. the film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package. ching siu tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere. also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters, with, if i'm not mistaken, joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, a marvellous touch. though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times, this is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with swell characters and plotting, even the odd neat character arc, a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere. an ethereal treasure, highly recommended.

first things first, the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed. now actress wang zu xian, the one who played xiao qian in the movie, is 42 years old and well aged. it's always good to review these glorious times when seeing old-school hongkong productions like this.the movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s. the art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing. more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it. it feels like a horror movie but ultimately it's not scaring, but only fun.i had the experience of translating the second script of "a chinese ghotst story", and i thought that script was a decent write. however when i saw the movie, i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script, like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles. however, it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining.if you have seen the lord of the rings, you will notice the similarities in this movie to lotr. the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch. it's definitely a laugh-out-loud. bravo!

very funny film. classic film funny eddie murphy of the 80s. i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory. the classic irony of murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done. murphy in the'80s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous. the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed. the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period. a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. the final part is anthologies, the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk. that's it.

sinnui yauman, is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film. written by songling pu and directed by siu-tung ching, a chinese ghost story has it all. ling choi sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging, deep in the woods, a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near. the trek alone is perilous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple.ling choi sin meets tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple. she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent ling choi sin they fall in love.ling choi sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place, while tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods. there's great martial arts, even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms. the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, leaping from tree to tree, with elegant long gowns and scarves, but the movie genuinely flows, and everything is effective.tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster, which cant be good, and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice.in the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue, and go with yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls, and bring ling's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation.a beautiful story that truly pays attention to details. one is touched in many ways by this movie, you'll laugh, cry, and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. and though at the end, yin and ling choi sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow, we never know if tsing was afforded a reincarnation, but we do know her

i saw this movie in my childhood. and after 10 years i did not remember anything about this movie but i found out it i also don't know how i was able to find out this movie. its my life. my all times favorite movie. my words will fall short of true meaning what i have inside for this movie. i follow this movie. it's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, scary and martial arts. the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm. it's a masterpiece of hong kong cinema.sinnui yauman, is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film. written by songling pu and directed by siu-tung ching, a chinese ghost story has it all. ling choi sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging, deep in the woods, a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near. the trek alone is perilous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple.ling choi sin meets tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple. she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent ling choi sin they fall in love.ling choi sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place, while tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods. there's great martial arts, even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms. the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, leaping from tree to tree, with elegant long gowns and scarves, but the movie genuinely flows, and everything is effective.tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster, which cant be good, and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice.in the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue, and go with yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls, and bring ling's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation.a beautiful story that truly pays attention to details. one is touched in many ways by this movie, you'll laugh, cry, and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. and though at the end, yin and ling choi sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow, we never know if tsing was afforded a reincarnation, but we do know her.

this movie is one of my favourites. it is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the action-/horror-/romantic-/comedygenre. some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. this minor flaw is easily ignored. there is so much to discover in this story. the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. the visuals are beautiful too. the action is great which is no surprise, it is originating from honkong, birthplace of the world's best action movies. the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way. somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good. absolutely recommended.

this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen, and, in my opinion, a lot better than hero or chrouching tiger, hidden dragon. the movie is a unique combination of several genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this!this movie definitely makes it to my top 5, and should be enjoyable to every movie lover. the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying, but the way it's shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense (ghosts can fly)see this movie, you won't regret it. 10/10

this movie is incredible.with great characters,specially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the trees,this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil.the final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool.very,very recommendable.not for the smallest children though.this one deserves a 10.

i first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the bbc when i was working on uk's 2000ad. my pal steve parkhouse recorded it on vhs and sent it to me. up till this point, i'd really only seen the shaw bros kung fu movies, with their harsh lighting (so audience could see the moves clearly), so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by ridley scott coming out of hong kong. this was also my first exposure to the movies of tsui hark (pronounced, apparently, "choy huk").yet for all the smoky, back-lit exteriors and ambitious special effects (stop-motion? in a hong kong movie?) at the heart of chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story, made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of leslie cheung (what a tragic, tragic waste of a life!) and the beauty and elegance of joey wong. granted joey is gorgeous, but it's her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that's hard to analyse. and though joey is now almost 20 years older (gawd, which of us isn't?) this will always be the enduring image of that actress.some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises, but they're missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous chinese story written by pu songling around 1700! that's a bit like complaining that romeo and juliet has a predictable ending and just copies west side story. (just wanted to get that off my chest!)for me, chinese ghost story is the quintessential romantic tale. it has high tragedy, because we know that chio sin and sin seen can never be together. it's about becoming mature, for none of us can mature until we've experienced great loss. it's about sacrifice, for sacrifice is an essential component of true love. and the comedy stylings of wu ma don't hurt a bit, either.enjoy chinese ghost story by trying not to view it through a filter of western culture and you'll get on with it just fine.

i saw this movie first on the berlin film festival, and i had never seen hong kong cinema before. i felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so quick, and there wasn't one boring moment throughout the film. it has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. my favorite scene is when the taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical component of the movie. this film is a definite must!!

by 1987 hong kong had given the world such films as sammo hung's `encounters of the spooky kind' chow yun fat in john woo's iconic `a better tomorrow', `zu warriors' and the classic `mr vampire'. jackie chan was having international success on video, but it was with `a chinese ghost story' that hk cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the west for many years.western filmgoers had never seen anything like it. it was a film that took various ingredients that hk cinema had used for years (flying swordsman, wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural) and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look, feel and execution. forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned, this is the original and best.director siu-tung ching (still best known as an action choreographer on such films as woo's `a better tomorrow 2'/'the killer') has, under the watchful eye of legendary producer tsui hark, created a masterpiece of fantasy/horror cinema. and with such an expert crew at his disposal (no less than 6 martial arts coordinators) the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable.the editing by the amazingly prolific david wu (who wrote/directed `the bride with white hair 2' and edited such classic titles as `a better tomorrow 1/2/3', `hardboiled' and the cult hit `the club') is quite simply a work of genius. his crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying, tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best hk cinema has ever created. fast moving, outlandish but never confusing they are, even today, the pinnacle of their art.the crew of cinematographers have also done miracles. this is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting. where wonderful blue tinged night sequences, shrouded in an ever-present ghostly fog, are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold. it's a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty. even the silken robes and dresses worn by hsiao tsing become living parts of the movie, whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen. even a simple scene where hsiao tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act. the sets are also amazing, giving an other worldly sense to the forests, and the temple and harshness to the scorched, flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale. the production design by zhongwen xi deserves the highest praise.another major factor to the films success is the music by romeo diaz and james wong. hong kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence, but on `a chinese ghost story' the music is, quite simply, vital. from the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters.the score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments. drums, bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect, but it's in the slower, achingly romantic pieces that it comes into it's own. here; flutes, strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an hk film. add to this the female vocal, stunningly beautiful song that plays over tsau-shen's and hsiao tsing's love making, (nothing is ever seen, but the effect is wonderful. this is lovingly innocent movie romance) and you have a shining example of the power a film's music can have.and we of course have the acting talent. leslie cheung (`a better tomorrow 1 & 2' and a very popular singer) is outstanding as the innocent tax collector. his work in the (thankfully mild) comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with joey wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence.joey wang (who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the chow yun fat/andy lau classic "god of gamblers") has never looked more radiant than how she does here. she is the epitome of ethereal beauty. her portrayal of the tragic hsiao tsing is stunning. she shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do, but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths. veteran actor wu ma (`mr. vampire', `swordsman') is great fun as the wise, brave, but ever so grumpy, yen. he treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease. and what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable.but what about the monsters and beasties?, i hear you cry. well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion/animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting tsau-shen), to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective lord black. complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads, and quite outstanding wire work. most of which has, to this day, never been topped.but the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirit's killer tongue. we first encounter this thing with an `evil dead' style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal french kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks. but later it's shown in all its crazy glory. it can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey, rips apart trees, wraps itself around buildings and coils it's slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks!! it can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth! it's an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldn't work. but it does, to fantastic and unforgettable effect.so what all this adds up to is a classic example of hong kong movie making. a true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie. it's a film packed with wit, invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, lush visuals, beautiful music, and most important to it's enduring charm, one of cinemas most moving romances.

a strange role for eddie murphy to take at the height of his career. while there is a lot of the "eddie murphy character," he plays a truly decent person. the rest of the cast is good, particularly the lovely charlotte lewis. her character's beauty and serenity held the tone of the film from getting to be too much murphy.

i grew up watching this movie ,and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid. don't listen to the critic reviews. they are not accurate on this film.eddie murphy really shines in his roll.you can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.i recommend this movie to everybody to see. it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.with demons ,dragons,and a little bald kid with god like powers.this movie takes you from l.a. to tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in tibet.just a beautiful view! so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up! you wont regret it!

this movie was good for it's time. if you like eddie murpy this is a must have to add to your collection. eddie was young and funny with his 80's haircut. charlotte lewis, eddie's costar is hot. this was one of her first movies and she was not bad. the graphics were good for the 80's. a lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through imdb. other must have from eddie is "coming to america" and "48 hours". another actor "victor wong" has a small part in this movie. check out some of his older movies like "big trouble in little china". if you liked the action movies from the 80's this is your movie.

eddie murphy spends his time looking for lost children, so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in tibet, the sexy charlotte lewis asks for his help to rescue this child from the clutches of evil itself.although the story is a bit silly, it never quite feels corny, despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film; charles dance off-sets the comedy with his very serious and dark characterisation of the evil that holds the child hostage.the golden child is very funny, action packed and really quite compelling in a charming, almost magical way.7/10 great for all generations.

this was a highly original decent movie, and a brave move for all those involved. i don't care if it's not the most well put-together movie of all time, the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non-formulaic, and that i don't know what will happen next, makes it a favorite of mine. i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old formula for entertainment.

while this movie has many flaws, it is in fact a fun '80s movie. eddie murphy peaks during his 80's movies here. while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies, his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils.couple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis, this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick.

i think the movie was pretty good, will add it to my "clasic collection" after all this time. i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie. maybe some of the more esoteric points defy "logic", but a great many religious matters accepted "on faith" fail to pass the smell test. if you're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie. is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja-yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in "the shadow". no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here (imdb), but i would bet a dollar to a donut it's the same prop.

eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. when the beautiful kee nang {charlotte lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child. sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon sardo numspa.is the golden child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop, but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best!, seriously!.cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by raiders of the lost ark in 1981, the golden child hits all the required genre buttons. pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {charles dance so english i could kiss him myself}, wonderful colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. yes the cgi demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously. 7/10

this movie is very entertaining, and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality. other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. it has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes.as a finder of lost children, murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was "chosen" - - to protect the golden child. the young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector.also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. one such scene is where the golden child, that murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice.this is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. as we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us.this is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting, and eddie murphy humor.

i love this film. it is well written and acted and has good cinematography. the story blends action, humor, mysticism, and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots. see it, buy it, show it to your friends.the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero. i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions.i cared what happened to these people and, while the outcome was pretty predictable (the good guys win, the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives--who doesn't see that coming?), it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end. thank god this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel. grab some popcorn, cuddle up on the couch, and watch this fun, happy and entertaining film.

every once in a while, eddie murphy will surprise you.in a movie like "the golden child", especially. this is a movie you'd figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone. but eddie really does work; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, kind, courteous, thrifty, clean and everything else a hero should be.having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (embodied perfectly by dance), eddie goes from california, to nepal and back, all while the beautiful kee nang (lewis) wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man (wong, perfect as always) knows that he is.it's exciting, breathtaking in spots, shocking and, of course, funny. eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart-aleck remarks about ed mcmahon.no problem with this "child": it's a "golden" find.nine stars. viva nepal!

i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie, which is why i left it unwatched for so long, but i was very pleasantly surprised.far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.it's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching. hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning? who's dying?alexandra staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as monica vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face, her hair, and her tall, slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics.nikolaj coaster-waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad-guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable (and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). i can't think of a single one of hollywood's "former waiters" who could have pulled the role off that well.fortunately, blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) that's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes.

this is a good movie, although people unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action. for the modesty fan, the movie will be very enjoyable, particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty blaise "history". peter o'donnell is listed in the credits as "creative consultant" and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years {although the events have been recast to modern days). the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no willie garvin in the story. this lack of willie is again just being faithful to the modesty blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of modesty's career. alexandra staden makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look. a welcome change from the travesty of the monica vitti portrayal of modesty.

for a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance. it is done with style and class showing modesty's early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world. i think it is a very honest/true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter o'donnell intended. alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice. she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool/intelligent/innocence. and full marks to tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more believeable to have a new face creating the part. i'm looking forward to the next film.

i was pleased to see that she had black hair! i've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories.i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer, it didn't spoil it at all. in fact i watched the film twice in one day, a sure sign that it was up to standard. this is what i do with books that i like as well.i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip. i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly. has he actually read the books?i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation.

i have read modesty blaise for several years now, collecting numbers of the strip. after the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book "modesty blaise" i was surprised the result got this good.what i got was a movie not based on action or violence. the director had focused on history and psychology. how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non-childhood. i think this thougths will give a greater understanding to the next (i hope) film. i simply loved the movies old-fashioned style.however everything wasn't that good, the gambling wasn't that good. almost boring and unreal. the acting could have been improved too. i'm not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real, the only reason he was there was so modesty could have someone to tell her story for. also they could have expanded the movie, showing more about when she builds up "the network" but i'll guess thats for the next movie.and please forgive me for my bad english

as a long time fan of peter o'donnell's greatest creation, i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment; indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes. but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production, and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story. they managed to avoid the trap of making a (bad) film version of the books we are all so familiar with, choosing instead to concentrate on a period in modesty's life only alluded to in the novels.as for the production values (and i am no student of cinematography!): yes, the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows... but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment? in this case i think not. instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities.in regard to the casting: because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and (perhaps) professor lob. for me they were totally credible. alexandra staden, described by some as wooden, and too thin to be an action heroine, brought to the screen modesty's poise and coolness; her technique (when martial arts were needed) but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise canon.ok, so we all know this film was produced to stake miramax's claim to the modesty blaise character, it was made quickly and cheaply, but... i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers - as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories!

the movie was a long awaited release, which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation's i had set up. when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok. first of all is it very true to the original history (of course not completely) and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie. modesty's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original. the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it to the 1966 vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical. generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv.

while the main story is supposed to take place in morocco, this movie was shot in foggy romania in 18 days on a very tight budget. however broken their cards may be, the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment, so that in the end i found the result both touching and graceful. nikolaj coaster-waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy. the script and direction provide some gems. whether you will like the movie or not, however, will probably depend on your take on alexandra staden in the title role. other reviewers have pointed out staden's inadequacies as modesty blaise. they may have a point, but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting. modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline, innate talent and courage. staden appears to be doing the same here.

i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it. charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine. his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero. i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner: a bit of "axel foley through the looking glass". charlotte lewis is, to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable, luminously gorgeous. some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes, and the climactic confrontation. through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp. like that movie we have james hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however short, raise the quality even of derek. since 1955 hong has defined the fine supporting actor, the "class act" of his profession. "the golden child" is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy, well worth watching. after four years i have seen "the golden child" again; i enjoyed it even more! it truly is great fun.

recap: it's business as usual at louche's casino in tanger. the casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day. the owner louche and some staff leave for the night, leaving modesty in charge. suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino, shooting wildly. unknown to modesty, they have already killed louche, and are now after the money hidden in the vault. but no one present, and still alive, at the casino knows the code to open the vault. the vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants can't blow the door as planned. suddenly modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters' leader miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy.comments: this is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about modesty blaise, as i have neither seen nor read any of it. the first point i like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified. foremost i thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between modesty and miklos as the main plot. sure, there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story.as already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense-filled scene, is the game between modesty and miklos. it's an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character, and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time. someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a tv-series, and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such. but, i felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done. i was in no way disappointed in the lack of action, instead i enjoyed this game, the history much more than a simple action movie.i think the two main stars, alexandra staden and nikolaj coaster-waldau did very well. staden especially portrays modesty very well, and really carries this confident and talented character.7/10

this was the modesty that we didn't know! it was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers! lee and janet batchler were true modesty blaise fans who were given the dream job - tell a prequel story of modesty that the fans never saw before. in their audio-commentary, they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother. the "purists" should also note that we really don't know if everything she told miklos was true because she was "stalling for time." i didn't rent or borrow the dvd like other "reviewers" did, i bought it! and i don't want a refund! i watched it three times and i didn't sleep through it! great dialog and well-drawn characters that i cared about (even bad guy miklos) just like in the novels and comic strips! i too can't wait for the next modesty (and willie) film,especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's to come!

shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of, the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect, certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films. you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books, or in comics revue monthly. it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. the movie isn't great, but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got, and it holds your interest. on the dvd extras, the interview with quentin tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is a gas. some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film, but without him it would never have been made. he is a modesty blaise fan, and picked a good writer and director. all things considered, worth 8 stars.

i enjoyed this film. it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter o'donnell.a number of people have disliked the film, but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is. the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became. before the network. before willie garvin.the pace is a trifle slow, and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes. however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version.if you like modesty blaise, you will enjoy it even with its faults, if you just want an action flick with car chases - forget it.it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise, but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere, i suspect there will be no more to follow. sadly.

the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far. it's like a good pilot for a tv-series. i even think it's a little bit "cult", like with a lite touch of quentin tarantino's magic, or something. they have caught a great deal of modesty's character, but i admit missing willy garwin a bit. even if i have read many comics and book by peter o'donnell i'm not disappointed of this film, quite the opposite. positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood. i did not put my expectations so high, because of the bad movie from 1966. so i may have overrate this movie just a little. but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise, you should definitely see this one! can't wait for a follow-up...

i've seen this movie and i must say i'm very impressed. there are not much movies i like, but i do like this one. you should see this movie by yourself and comment it,because this is one of my most favorite movie. i fancy to see this again. action fused with a fantastic story. very impressing. i like modesty's character. actually she's very mystic and mysterious (i do like that^^). the bad boy is pretty too. well, actually this whole movie is rare in 'movieworld'. i considered about the vote of this movie, i thought this is should be a very popular movie. i guess wrong. it was me who was very impressed about this movie, and i hope i'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one. see and vote.

having heard of modesty blaise before, but never having read a novel or a comic strip, my wife and i liked the film a lot. it delivered, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and her background.although it has some action flick elements, it is much more an intimate play, excellently written. sadly, this is also, where a major drawback of the movie is revealed. an intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered. while alexandra staden did an excellent job as modesty blaise, her counterpart nikolaj coaster-waldau - as the villain miklos - did not. smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial, he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece. the supporting cast is somehow similar, from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from fred pearson as professor lob and eugenia yuan as irina.

there's a great deal of material from the modesty blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie. unfortunately, several attempts have been made and they've fallen short of the great potential in the character. so, no, this isn't the modesty you know from the comic strip (currently reprinted in nice editions from titan books). this is modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip, and from what you can piece together from her back-story, it's accurate.miramax had the movie rights to the character, with quentin tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser. early drafts of the miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels, but always managed to leave out some crucial element. tarantino wasn't happy with any of them, and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed. to the studio's credit, they wanted to keep him in the process, since they knew he "got" the character and her world. with the movie rights close to expiration, they decided to try a very different approach. the result was "my name is modesty," a small direct-to-video movie that introduces the character.the movie does not introduce willie garvin or sir gerald. these characters are important to blaise's adventures throughout most of the published stories. what this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself. she never loses her composure, and you never doubt that she's in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns. most of the movie takes place within a casino, which undoubtedly saved money on the production. it doesn't matter. the film does not come across as cheap. instead, it gives a fairly comprehensive (and believable) back-story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead. should miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now, they've laid out the character's background nicely and won't have to spend much time on her "origin." i realize the words "direct-to-video" don't inspire confidence, but this film is well worth a look.

first off; i'm a dedicated fan of modesty's, and have been reading the comics since i was a child, and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying, but where they fail, this one rocks! well then, here we go: ms blaise is working for a casino, a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives. if the robber wins one round, she'll have to tell him about herself. if she wins two times in a row, one of the staff members goes free. (sounds stupid, yeah, well, i'm not that good at explaining either..) ;)she tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape, living by nature's own rules. they hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war, and as they are taken for rebellions, they are being shot at and the old man dies, which leaves her to meet the city by herself.then she meets the man who's casino she's now working for, and there the story ends. what is to follow is that there's an awesome fight and the line's are totally cool. alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise! just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic-one.feels awkward though, too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but that's not relevant since the comic book- blaise can't speak out loud, but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent. (not to mention that it's weird everybody's speaking english in the balkan..)the acting is really good, even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud! my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber's ass! totally awesome! :d i can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie/s!watch it, you won't be disappointed!

finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the "real" story. i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter o'donnell. you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is. it is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real tale. some things could have been better, but when you cannot forget the awful movie from '66 then is this a magnificent movie. so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story.

whenever i see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for eddie murphy'. these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he's doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect... "the golden child" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichés, and gives murphy one of his best roles. i don't understand the pervading lack of 'love' for its efforts, at all. perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? steven spielberg started it with indiana jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. there's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.yes it's silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends. what's more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.

rented and watched this short (< 90 minutes) work. it's by far the best treatment modesty has received on film -- and her creator, peter o'donnell, agrees, participating as a "creative consultant." the character, and we who love her, are handled with respect. spiegel's direction is the best he's done to date, and the casting was very well done. alexandra staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original jim holdaway illustrations of modesty. a terrific find by whoever cast her! raymond cruz as a young rafael garcia was also excellent. i hope that tarantino & co. will go on to make more in the series -- i'm especially interested to see whom they'd choose to be the incomparable willie garvin!

although i bought the dvd when it first came out, and have watched it several times, i never wrote a review.i loved it when i first saw it and i love it still.sadly, it seems it never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow-up. i have to assume qt still controls the rights, but after kill bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as my name is modesty, with another tough female lead, anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let-down.peter o'donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillers.the tug of wills between modesty and miklos is very true to the source material and is tense, suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions. alexandra did a great job in playing how o'donnell's character would have taken control of the situation.i find this particularly ahead of the curve following the sorely needed reboots of batman and james bond. after 2 dismal earlier efforts, although not nearly as well known to the public, this is really a reboot of the modesty character, and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made.

if you are already a fan of peter o'donnell's wonderful modesty blaise books from the sixties, you will really enjoy this movie. if you have ever seen the 1966 "modesty blaise" film, forget it! that was camp. this is the real modesty blaise. the story and character are both true to the modesty that fans of the books know and love. it's a long way from joe losey's 1966 travesty, and it takes our modesty quite seriously. alexandra staden is quite good and believable in the part, and yes, we do get to see her kick butt. chucklethis is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce modesty, her childhood and her days with lob.since peter o'donnell was the creative consultant on the movie, everything really rings true. even the story o'donnell told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it. having read all the books, i enjoyed the movie even more for that.now that miramax has kept their option on the property by having quentin tarrentino make this film, i do hope to see more of the modesty stories asap. especially as the wonderful character of willie garvin makes modesty's character really come alive. to that end, i really hope the film does well in europe. i have no idea if miramax intends to ever distribute the dvd in the usa. i suspect it might not do that well in the usa in general distribution. i wonder how miramax decides where and how to distribute it's films.in the story, modesty is in her early 20's, working at louche's casino in tangier. the flashback sequences are artfully done and take modesty from about 9 years old, through her teens up to her current age in the movie - about 21-22, i'd guess. i really don't think there's a "perfect actress" for modesty. for many of us modesty fans, she's much too powerful a presence in our imaginations already. alexandra staden is credible. she is very slim, graceful and poised. she has lots of closeups. she has a great face - one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over. according to o' donnell's illustrator, romero, modesty has rather a fuller figure than staden, but i'm willing to overlook that. if staden continues in the role, i think she will mature into it - just as modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older. staden already conveys modesty's humor and absolute assurance very well. go ahead and rent this movie, it's not like anything else you've seen and even though it was directed by scott spiegel, it is full of tarrentino touches, great camera moves, lighting and well-done action sequences.

unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for imdb equate low budget with not good. whatever else this movie might need, more budget really isn't part of it. big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another lara croft movie. what we have here is a step or two better than that.the nearly unknown alexandra staden is captivating as the enigmatic modesty, and this is crucial for this movie to work. her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable, and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't leaver her face. it makes it workable that the bad guy nikolai, played by also little known (in the u.s. at least) nikolaj coaster-waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her, something modesty can exploit. she is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out "stop wasting my time!" then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen. making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident.probably the biggest problem i have with the rail-thin staden playing modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like coaster-waldau and beat him. she just ain't a peta wilson or a pumped-up hilary swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch. coaster-waldau letting himself be overpowered by staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his little sister.since this is not really an action film, this isn't a big flaw. i just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels.

this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it's kind. the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen. it treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies. the sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. no such scenes are present or needed. the argument is sand honest to the spectator; an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience. no, this is not miss marble... a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute, not just to see.

short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men. one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses. later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays. hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival (during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids, so it is really serious). with exposed, well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women. one gets caught, the other remains free and is not given away by his companion. a last encounter, a last light for a cigarette, adieu l'ami, farewell, friend.i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters, played by classical he-man superstars alain delon and charles bronson. they are obviously attracted to each other, their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout. the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow, a little like deliverance. it is also very stylish. the safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower. it is the seat of a publicity firm, so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around. the wardrobe is also very good. the ultra stylish citroen ds (maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times) features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement.i can recommend this movie for the actor's performances alone. delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing, in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting. both do a considerable amount of acrobatics. i have never seen bronson better than here, he really acts - and speaks french throughout, with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed. and it is certainly the man himself we hear. (so the french language version is highly recommended). the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors, bernard fresson who was gene hackman's partner in french connection ii. he is the best brainy police inspector i know. also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingénue who, as it turns out, is not so innocent as it first seems.anyone who expects the old in-an-out" of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film. for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience, full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks, although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake.

utterly tactical, strange (watch for the kinky moment of a drop-dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull-string doll for some rich folks), pointless but undoubtedly compelling late-night feature. this unhinged french production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars (if somewhat anti-heroes) alain delon and charles bronson. really they don't get to do all that much, especially during the confined, lengthy mid-section where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with 10,000 possible combinations. oh fun! but this is when the odd, if intriguing relationship is formed between delon and bronson's characters. after a manipulative battle of wills (and childishly sly games against each other), the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other's involvement and have a mutual respect. this would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curve-ball. still their encounters early on suggest there's more, but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that 'what just happen there?' ending that might just make you jump. yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh! glad to get that out of the system. the pacing is terribly slow, but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy, nervous underlining tension. watch as the same process is repeated over and over again, and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play. now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous, but the climax payoff is haunting. the taut, complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good, but there are some neat novelties (coins, glass and liquids try not spilling) and visual symbolisms. jean herman's direction is efficiently sophisticated and low-key, but get a tad artificial and infuse an unwelcoming icy atmosphere. the sound fx features more as a potent note, than that of francois deroubaix's funky score that's mainly kept under wrapped after its sizzling opening. top drawers delon (who's quite steely) and bronson (a jovial turn) are solid, and work off each tremendously. bernard fresson chalks up the attitude as the inspector who knows there's more going on than what is being led on. an attractive female cast features able support by brigitte fossey and olga georges-picot. a cryptically directionless, but polished crime drama maintained by its two leads and some bizarre inclusions.

this movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it's kind. the interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen. it treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies. the sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. no such scenes are present or needed. the argument is flowless and honest to the spectator, wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience. no, this is not miss marble... a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savour every minute, not just to see.

the premise may seem goofy, but since murphy's character doesn't take it seriously, it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction. excellent cast, particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis, and murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy/action. there's also some great f/x, a very surreal dream sequence, and a fairly original plot. often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks, but this one is worth a look.

farewell friend aka adieu l'ami/honour among thieves isn't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault, one to return stolen bonds, the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend. naturally things aren't quite that simple even after they open the vault, leading to some neat twists and turns. on the debit side, there's a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park, bronson has a very irritating fonzie-like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments, brigitte fossey, sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s (it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind), is something of a liability  her "i'll cook spaghetti! i'll learn to make love well! i'll read shakespeare!" speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways  and it's a shame about the horrible last line/shot, but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that's worth checking out if you can find a decent print.cinema club's uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack, but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that's no great problem, especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality.

a clever script from the late sebastian japrisot and smart performances from the two male leads - alain delon and charles bronson (or should it be the other way around) result in an engaging and entertaining thriller.add to the above the competent direction from veteran jean herman and a sparse but effective score by francois de roubaix, it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality.this is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two loners, both disillusioned and world weary, returning, presumably from algiers. like the other colonial powers of this time (post ww ii leading into the 60s), france had struggled to keep up appearances overseas. losing algiers was a bitter blow.adieu l'ami (the original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to make a go of it, after their discharge.one thing happens after another, and the viewer really has to pay attention, because japrisot is lean and economical with his script: if it is there, then there must be a reason.suffice to say, these two men battle it out, physically and psychologically, one long weekend. their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. that alain delon and charles bronson are outwardly so different - the former, arguably a pretty boy, and the latter an ugly thug, adds to the chemistry.that quest makes for a great story, which in turn, makes for a great film.lest i forget there are women in this film, and true to the japrisot method, they too are memorable, though not nearly as fleshed out; to say much more would be to spoil one's delight in discovering their true nature.farewell, friend has been released in the uk; an anamorphic image, 16.9 enhanced; in english only (not even subtitles for the hard of hearing); a running time of 110 minutes; mono soundtrack but the de roubaix music has lots of punch! highly recommended.

i loved this movie. i totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that i've read over the years. this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy! he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it! and, it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr. murphy's great comedic style. you have to keep in mind that 'golden child' is a 'fantasy' film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. during the time this film was released, i was working in a video rental store. this was one of the most popular with all our customers. every single time, we put this one up on our monitor, all the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! everyone who rented it loved it! i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them. i really feel that this film is a sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (yes, i did buy this film for my own video library!). i adored the little boy who played the 'golden child'  j. l. reate - but after looking at his profile in imdb, i noticed that he never did any more films. that is sad, because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. i also adored victor wong, who played the old man (i loved him in his part as 'egg shen' in 'big trouble in little china' - 1986). at any rate, this was a great film. the only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature  such as 'chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. it was funny, but it still was out of sync. ok, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood. now that's entertainment!

"the golden child" was eddie murphy's first film since his megahit "beverly hills cop". and even though it's not as good as "cop", it's a fun comic adventure. murphy stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case. his assignment: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. this movie could have been titled "beverly hills cop and the temple of doom" since parts of this movie plays like a spielbergian adventure, kinda like an indiana jones comedy. it's got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. lots of fun.*** (out of four)

ed harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and that includes the formidable sean connery. the movie, which is more than a bit sanctimonious, comes alive only in the scenes when harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict. it is breathtaking, a master class in artistic control.the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable, as is fishbourne, but the story itself packs no wallop. the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers. this is the engine which drives the story, right or wrong, and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end.still, worth watching to see harris in action.

this is a very good movie. do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie? i will tell you. in this movie, you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor. a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right, thus. making the white professor look stupid. it always comes down to race. this is an excellent movie. pay no attention to the racist. if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters, then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this movie. i recommended everyone to go see this movie.

this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie. there are many plots and turns. the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people. this film is very well directed by arne glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent. strong performance of sean connery and ed harris. if you liked this one don´t miss "true crimes" or "the hurricane". my wife and me gave 8/10.

i've read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say "what is wrong with you people?!?!" this was an excellent film! i thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told. i'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film. there are a number of very important scenes that if you aren't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. i urge anyone who didn't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention. the story made perfect sense to me and as i said, was very well told. every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film.all the actors did a fantastic job! sean connery was very good in his role as always. laurence fishburne was superb as tanny brown, playing a very interesting character. kate capshaw was a nice touch as well, and looks fantastic. blair underwood was a pleasant surprise, i didn't really expect anything great from him, but he pulled off a great performance. ed harris was the real gem in the film. he plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is. watch his eyes in his scenes, just superb!!! also, there is a very young scarlett johansson (as kate) in one of her first roles...not a bad place to start. excellent cast in this film!i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers. this is a great film and should be seen. don't listen all these other people's opinions, go see the movie and come to your own conclusions. i hope that you will see the film, and i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do. thanks for reading,-chris

as usual, sean connery does a great job. lawrence fishburn is good, but i have a hard time not seeing him as ike turner.

i just saw the movie on tv. i really enjoyed it. i like a good mystery. and this one had me guessing up to the end. sean connery did a good job. i would recomend it to a friend.

the movie was a suspenseful, and somewhat dark, look at the severe results of a genuinely human mistake. connery and fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption. keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movie...you'd never expect it!

i really liked this film. all three stars(connery,fishburne and underwood) give credible performances;and harris is enjoyably over the top. the lighting and shot angles in some of harris' scenes make his face look truly diabolical. the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting. not a great movie, but an enjoyable one. i gave it 7 of 10.

a young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by blair underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row. sean connery plays the "happy go lucky" attorney whom the young man's grandmother tracks down out of retirement and pleads with to take on the case in the hopes of freeing her grandson. laurence fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell bent on debunking an theory that connery might dig up to try and free the boy whom he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime. ed harris, kate capshaw, ruby dee, and the late lynne thigpen co-star in this very intense dramatic thriller.

i enjoyed this movie, granted it is mainly because i enjoy seeing sean connery act and this one has the added bonus of having ed harris and lawrence fishburne in it too. the story has a grandma seeking out connery's assistance because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted. at first it seems there may have been some racist aspects of the case, however it later turns out the main officer on the case was black himself and it seems he did some rather bad things to coerce a confession out of the boy. well the boy tries to point to another killer locked up in the same prison, one who is about to be put to death. he is a particularly nasty person too, as he takes a lot of joy in what he did, writing the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to mail them. a lot of twists and turns in this one with some of it being somewhat unexpected. me i just enjoyed sean connery's character trying to make sense of the whole ordeal. the movie also made me mad in areas, especially when you find out what ultimately happened. you get very good interplay between connery and harris and connery and fishburne as they all shine rather well in this one. in the end this one makes for a rather good suspense/thriller.

to fight against the death penalty is a just cause. everyone who is sane in europe would think so. in the usa everything is different. the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving american justice. a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case. but the film has a sequel. justice in the usa is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance. miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance. one person in the local public attorney offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. this public attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free. but he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire. he hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance. but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls. he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys. one day the local cops follow their intuition, guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl, and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of. they beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and russian roulette. he confesses. sent to death row, he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in massachusetts who is the husband of the local public attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails. it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice, police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality, some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance. to charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice. the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention, just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence, which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial, hence easily discardable, with a good lawyer. the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake, which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have: "we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." (declaration of independence) life is an unalienable right that was given to man by his creator, which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away. only god can take the life of a person away. the death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have. even if we do not evoke god, we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance, and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace. if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty. and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne, university paris 8 saint denis, university paris 12 créteil, cegid

hi.. i consider just cause one of my favorite sean connery's movies, it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast, especially connery..it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies, so the dialog is pretty good in this one.. it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when sean interviews ed harris's character in prison is just fantastic..i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough, really do not miss this one ! do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, i really find just cause a very entertaining movie..

i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear. i completely disagree. i'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there. i thought the casting was perfect. i thought this was one of ed harris's best performances. what an evil psychopath!!! i have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie. i was riveted throughout this movie. if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see. i also noticed a young scarlett johannson in this movie. this movie is filled with top stars and i highly recommend it!

just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative (though exceedingly predictable) writing. sean connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man (blair underwood) from the ultimate penalty. to set things right, connery ventures to the scene of the crime, where he must contend not only with the passage of time, but a meddling sheriff (laurence fishbourne). twists and turns and role reversals abound -- some surprising, some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery. the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous, but just cause is worth a look on a slow night.

just cause takes some of the best parts of three films, cape fear, a touch of evil and silence of the lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film.sean connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former assistant district attorney, kate capshaw and he's a crusader against capital punishment. blair underwood's grandmother ruby dee buttonholes connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal. he's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl.when connery arrives in this rural florida county he's up against a tough sheriff played by laurence fishburne who's about as ruthless in his crime solving as orson welles was in touch of evil. later on after connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's uncovered, he's feeling pretty good about himself. at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fear.to say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly. the cast uniformly turns in some good performances. special mention must be made of ed harris who plays a hannibal lecter like serial killer on death row with underwood. he will make your skin crawl and he starts making connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he's been basing his convictions on. many a confirmed liberal i've known has come out thinking quite differently once they've become a crime victim.of course the reverse is equally true. many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed.criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. i guess if just cause has a moral that would probably be it.

a compelling thriller!!, 10 december 2005 author:littlehammer16787 from united statesjust causestarring:sean connery,laurence fishburne, and blair underwood.a liberal,though good-hearted harvard law professor paul armstrong is convoked to the flordia everglades by unjustly convicted black guy bobby earl.confessing that sadistic,cold-hearted cops vilifyied and beat him to a pulp to get the confession of a gruesome murder of an eleven year old girl. as he digs further and further into the mysterious case he realizes that bobby earl is a victim of discrimination.that the black police detective lt.tanny brown of the small community is corrupt and villainously mean. when the infamous,psychotic serial killer blair sullivan is introduced.he discovers that he knows the location of the murder weapon that butchered the little girl.when armstrong finds that there are lucid coincidences of sullivan's road trip through the small town and the letter he personally wrote. bobby earl gets a re-trial.is unfettered from prison and eludes his horrific punishment. all seems swimmingly well until an unexpected phone call from serial killer sullivan comes into focus.armstrong discovers a lurid double killing which happens to be sullivan's parents.whom he immensely detests.sullivan divulges to armstrong the truth of joanie shriver's heinous murder and why he was brought here.it turns out that bobby earl is a psychopathic murderer and he really did rape and kill joanie shriver.he just merely struck a bargain with fiendish psycho sullivan. to get loose so he could kill again for revenge.upon armstrong's beautiful wife and daughter.now sullivan is executed to his death. armstrong and tough good guy brown chase the malevolent villain to the everglades in order to thwart him.when they arrive armstrong learns that the psychotic sicko bobby earl plans to kill his wife and daughter for a former rape trial that inevitably made him endure agonizing pain and castration.but good,virtuous cop brown emerges and thwarts the brutal baddie.is stabbed and eaten by ruthless,man-eating alligators.paul armstrong,tanny brown,his wife,and daughter survive and live happily ever after. a good thriller that works.delivers both mystery and subterfuge.how reluctant blacks are hazed by racist lawmen.sentenced to unfair penalties.even though sometimes the wrongfully convicted innocent, friendly black man may in truth be the vicious baddie. sean connery is great as the oblivious,holier than thou hero.laurence fishburne is watchably amazing as the mean,arrogant,but good guy cop. underwood and harris are over the top and invigorating as the malevolent psychos.capeshaw is okay.ruby dee is great as the tenacious grandmother.the rest of the cast is wonderful as well.

this movie really is a mixed bag. on the one hand, the story and concept of the movie are really good, tense and have some nice plot twists in it. but than again on the other hand, it all is told very slow, without style and uninvolved. still i regard "just cause" as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast.maybe sean connery was miscast in his role. i mean, he isn't really that believable as a the main 'hero' and father of a young daughter (played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way) and husband of kate capshaw. i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it. however sean connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does. but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne, blair underwood, ned beatty, hope lange, lynne thigpen and ed harris. all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time, which is a real shame, as well as a missed opportunity. especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. he's truly chilling and acting superbly. normally he doesn't play this ruthless, chilling sort of roles in movies, so he really surprises with his role in this one. his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie. however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic, none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant.it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential. arne glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times. because of this, we as viewers, never really get involved with the story or any of it's characters.it really is too bad, for "just cause" had more than enough potential. a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems. the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller, that will probably still please the fan of the genre. it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style, or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre.7/10

never having seen this movie, based on the entertaining novel by nicholas katzenbach, and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production, we decided to take a look. "just cause", while not a horrible film, takes too many liberties with the original material that jeb stuart didn't quite succeed in his treatment. arne glimcher directed.the first thing we think when a young black man is hauled to the local precinct for interrogation is police brutality. after all, sheriff tanny brown, and police officer wilcox, show no mercy in beating bobby earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. we feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner.then, the scene changes. evangeline, bobby earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished harvard professor, a retired lawyer, the young man wants paul armstrong to defend him. she old woman is convincing enough for armstrong to take a look at the case. he is also convinced of the young man's innocence.things are not exactly what we thought they were. when blair sullivan, a man who is serving time in the same facility as bobby earl, comes forward to tell about how he is connected to the young girl's murder, and changes the dynamics of the case. the way it plays in the movie, it serves to confuse the viewer and distract armstrong from arriving at the truth.this thriller is made enjoyable by sean connery, who plays armstrong. laurence fishburne, an intense actor, makes a fine impression as the sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. ed harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. blair underwood, kate capshaw, ruby dee and the young scarlett johansson are seen in supporting roles.the film, even with its faults, will not disappoint.

okay. yes, this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors (like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part, and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). but come on. richard grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). steven ford was very likable. mancuso had some great lines, while nancy allen, ironically, was completely bland and uninteresting. classic? no. bad parts? yes. entertaining? big yes. i would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have. "are you fast?" ... "y'ain't that fast."

this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard grieco,(rex),"dead easy",'04, decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot, sexy waitress. while rex steps out of the cafe, he sees a state trooper and asks him,"are you fast?" and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one. nancy allen (maggie hewitt),"dressed to kill,",'80, is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast. maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down, western style, with the local top cop in town. this is a different film, however, nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together!

an unusually straight-faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. imperfect, as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama is involving-- it's one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax 2 or more max or whatever they call it, you end up watching 40 minute blocks when you're supposed to be going to work. along w/ "deathstalker 2", "chopping mall", and "the assault", a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low-budget brethern, who has a real ability to pace a genre film, when he actually's interested in the material (i.e., don't bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title!) actors who've had too little to do recently (mancuso, ford, even gary sandy for chrissakes) really put their all into some of their best roles in years -- as for grieco, he has the right look, although his acting is a bit one-note -- it's clear his character is supposed to be self-destructing throughout the film, but grieco doesn't quite convey it. i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote "sorority house massacre 2" & "dinosaur island" for the director -- both minor classics in their own rights, but obviously "silly" roger cormon-like cinema -- this one's more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan b-pictures of the 70's -- giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time -- a real step forward. not "citizen kane," and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive, but a well-written, character-driven above-average straight-to-video actioner. small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along, which is rare enough (as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called "heatseeker" the other night -- this low-budget stuff isn't as easy as it looks -- but that's another story!)

this anime was underrated and still is. hardly the dorky kids movie as noted, i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it. one of the better movies released.the animation while not perfect is good, camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground-breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon. it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view. it's a story to entertain, not to question.still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes. not to say its a childish movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all.

i felt compelled to write a review for space cobra as it has received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive. a strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten anime movie. space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. this is an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. space cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. there are few if any references to specific japanese culture and great for anime novices to watch and enjoy. space cobra himself is witty and likable. i cannot say how much of this is due to the english dub or the intentions of the maker, but this is one of the few japanese comedy characters that i find truly funny. the style is very sixties barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by yello. the style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. the strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. i cannot think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. you barely realise that it is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. you also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience. check out if you can.

probably the most whimsical installment of the first season, 'shore leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short, but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode. kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on. it appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. the first indication that things might go just a little awry is when mccoy, leading an advance team, spots alice (from wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters. the one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person/place/thing they discovered right before they discovered it. this doesn't immediately sink in with kirk or anyone else. more strangeness ensues, including sightings of don juan, a siberian tiger, a ww2 fighter plane, etc; kirk meets up with ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his academy days, finnegan. the chase/fight scene with finnegan goes on too long but at the same time, mccoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. finally, an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening. the planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear. nothing is permanent; mccoy isn't really dead. once this is explained, kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all. despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending, 'shore leave' holds up as another first-rate episode of star trek's first season.

i watched shore leave the other day. i've seen it so many times, and i never get tired of it. strangely enough, every time i watch it lately, it takes me right back to the very first time i saw it. including this time. must be that sense of mystery and "what is going on here?" about it.oddly enough, the one part of the story that always felt awkward and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a huge effect on me-- ruth. i think a lot of it was gerald fried's score. a real masterpiece, that! the romantic section was reused-- much more extensively-- in this side of paradise. but of course, it debuted here. i get the impression that, out of all the girls kirk knew over the years, she may have been the "sweetest". when she said, "do you have to go?", combined with the music, i could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.someone commented online that ruth looked older than he was, yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years. which makes me think... maybe she was one of the teachers at the academy. kirk had an affair with an older woman! (perhaps he thought back to this in "miri" when he told janice, "i never get involved with older women." maybe he meant, "...anymore."reading st reviews the other day, i see where someone compared what are little girls made of? with i, mudd. but it seems shore leave oughta be in there, too. what are all those "people" if not androids? and could "the caretaker" be related to "the old ones" from the earlier episode? whoever he is, he seems to be one of the rare cases in st where you have a race that is actually "superior" as opposed to merely thinking they are.yeoman barrows seems to be filling in for yeoman rand. considering how much attention dr. mccoy showered on her, it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again! sheesh.one thing missing from the last several i've watched that snuck back in here was, spock smiling. he was! i saw him. i really prefer knowing there's 2 sides to him going on inside all the time, rather than this "submerged" business. when he said, "enjoy yourself, sir." near the beginning, you could see it wasn't just his addressing his superior officer, but talking to his friend. and at the end, when he needlessly says, "totally illogical!", i can't help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction. he may not be smiling or laughing, but i think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy.

this one's a romp; many trek fans don't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones, but this one is so well executed for what it is, so successful as pure entertainment, it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes, no matter what mood i'm in. several well known future movies ("westworld") and tv shows (the more bland "fantasy island") took their cue from the premise of this episode (then, of course, the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology). beautifully filmed (especially evident in the restored version and on dvd) and directed, it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to. it's odd that no animal life, even insects, seems to exist here (how are flowers pollinated, for example), but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past (kirk has a people-heavy past, it turns out), as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories. sulu even finds an old-style police revolver (adding to his collection of swords, no doubt).by this point in the trek series (halfway thru the first season), the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we'd come to know over the many proceeding years. here, we get to really see them relax, converse and work together to figure out this episode's puzzle: the strong narrative is a mystery again, of sorts, and the audience is along for the ride as kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them. it's almost whimsical, following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue (the enterprise had, it's suggested, just completed a harrowing mission). then dr. mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback; yes, this is dr. mccoy's final episode...just kidding. but, it's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story. mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and, like the best trek episodes, the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic, more desperate tempo of action and suspense. this is all signaled by kirk's resolute response to sulu, who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoy's death - kirk will get to the bottom of all this, come what may.but, it doesn't get much easier for kirk: what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days, a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet. yet, this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness, with another of kirk's past acquaintances. this episode runs the gamut of all human experience, rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet. it's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what's happened, as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines (unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there). and there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to 'work' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion, or we just don't function in a 'normal' natural way. also, note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand, who did not return until the first trek movie in '79. i believe that after this episode, even more trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters. but i leave this episode with a final, perhaps tantalizing thought: if mccoy was killed (verified by spock), how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship? perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data.

probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb balance of terror) with a lighter affair, shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi, and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry (the true triumph is trouble with tribbles, in season 2), the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness.diverting from the show's tradition, the enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode. instead, kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty: a well deserved break after three months of incessant work. the earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: dr. mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carroll's work. soon, other people begin experiencing similar things: a woman meets a don juan-like character, sulu has a run-in with a samurai, and kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy. throw in a freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt.the idea is a classic one: idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly. the episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful, weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious william shatner). and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of star trek's success.7,5/10

"shore leave" is mostly an average star trek adventure. nothing wrong with the episode, though. i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans. it is lightweight entertaining, nothing more. however, i'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. in this episode, kirk decides to grant his crew some time off, and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. as usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be. there are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played for laughs. good, but unexceptional.

another episode from childhood that, as an adult, i look back on with a different perspective. this was one of my favorite childhood episodes, one that really cemented my adoration of this show. however, on viewing this episode after 20 years, i'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones, played for laughs and amusement, instead of the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this, their first and best season. perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r&r too! as mr. spock would say, the story just isn't logical but there are some amusing lines like, of course, mr. spock's final one at the end--when he asks the captain, mccoy et al whether they enjoyed their r&r and they answer in the affirmative, he raises an eyebrow and says "fascinating..." in only the way mr. spock could do that. an interesting story line, of course, the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying "amusement" of disneyland, for example), being able to have one's wishes actually come true. really, a great idea but not that well executed. and coming from theodore sturgeon, another of the great sf short story writers they used in the first season, one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that sturgeon turned in.now, here is a little trivia i learned on this very site: in 1987, james gunn established the theodore sturgeon award for best short science fiction story. and i'll quote the rest from this site: in 1968 he {sturgeon} wrote "the joy machine", a third script for the star trek tv series {amok time the other}, that was never shot. the main reason that it wasn't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget. however, the script was adapted into a book by sci-fi writer james gunn (star trek #80, the original series) and published by pocket books in 1996.i'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable, especially if one doesn't think too much about it. just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe.

this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun. but, i appreciated this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. think about it--the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland, a bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills mccoy, and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end. despite all the danger, you just can't take everything very seriously--it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. so, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.

bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this. shore leave is really tos' first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles). it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of, for example, the corbomite manouever.looking for a place to chill out for a while, the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet, and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look. soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly perilous - but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery (mccoy has gone through the looking glass), psychological thriller (kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past), and romantic comedy (no comment).tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise, so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy-handed, potentially calamitous drama. unlike later series franchise writers, tos' production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before. and shore leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. my only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st's themes. the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run - both compositionally and in terms of acting.'nuff said. my recommendation - see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen - it order.

okay, we've got extreme verhoeven violence (although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks), we've got plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missing...oh, yes, it's missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci-fi movies. i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most verhoeven films, the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre. the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible. the crew has truly made an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects done on set). the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible, they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible.the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive. here, it takes place at a lab for the most part. i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or let's say steal something from people's purses, or something like that. but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie. grade: b

contains spoilers"hollow man" is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven, director of great movies like "total recall", "starship troopers" and "robocop" has ever made. that's probably not his fault. for some reason, verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script, and he made the best of it. the first part of this movie is rather good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even skunk anansie on the soundtrack. unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad "alien" clone. the ending is especially ridiculous <spoiler>, as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. </spoiler>. and the entire thing is quite shallow, indeed: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated.but all in all, verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie. **1/2 out of **** stars

paul verhoeven (genius and master film maker) strikes back with the less than perfect, yet still fun in a "dirty old man type of way," hollow man. the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints. yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it's mind blowing special effects (perhaps the best so far around) and two dandy performances by the leads. verhoeven's moral questions are of course thought provoking, and although the film turned off many, this movie is pretty soft-core for old verhoeven.two major flaws: josh brolin (aka walking ape-man) and the whole deal with the elevator. if there was an access ladder, why were they trapped down in the lab? a fun horror film for a saturday night.

hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade. the sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film. kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way.claude rains shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933, well now, kevin bacon has shocked *us* with hollow man. one of the most thrilling horror films ever. the action is intense and the chills are true. you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night. the supporting cast includes elizabeth shue, josh brolin, kim dickens, joey slotnick, greg grunberg, and mary randle. all of whom do an exceptional job. ---spoilers---dr. sebastian caine (kevin bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. after animal testings, they move on to human testing. but someone has to be the subject. volenteering, caine is turned invisible. but when his team is unable to bring back into visibility, caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge...*end spoilers*the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century. becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie 2, this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go. the first 45 minutes or so are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. think of deep blue sea. then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man. and then change the water into fire and explosions. a rehashing of a killer shark movie. interesting... hollow man gets 5/5.

this movie scared me so bad, i am easily scared though so its no big thing but this movie was scary and whoever wasnt scared by this movie, im surprised because everyone i know said it was scary, i hope everyone sees it, but dont see it with the lights off like i did....

remember h.g. wells' "the invisible man"? well here's another movie like it, only more extreme. "hollow man" is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. kevin bacon plays sebastian caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes. at first making the serum was the easy part, making the person come back was not. most of the first tries ended up unstable. until one night, when he perfected the formula. and who else, but caine would be the lab rat. the gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came to, it was a close one. so when the did caine, he decided to use it for fun. then when he got tired of being not seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh. however, the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should, and caine would delve into madness. so he ends up being one mad invisible killer. it would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you. i would care less about the ones who did you wrong. great movie, plenty of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!

hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr. sebastian caine (kevin bacon) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum. they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly, caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human. he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. but then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants...directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man. you know it's just after christmas, i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief. the script by andrew w. marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man (1933) film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit. it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. i thought the character's were ok, i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself. then of course there's the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.director verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that. there's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla. there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.with a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 hollow man is technically faultless, i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they? the acting was ok, bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well i know i do. good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.

a pentagon science team seem to have perfected a serum which causes invisibility but when the lead boffin tries it out on himself he can't reverse the process. frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychotic in the classic h.g. wells tradition.this is a gleefully horrible invisible man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful verhoeven and bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac. as with much of verhoeven's work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of boy's-own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals (women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels). whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea, the cg special effects by scott e. anderson are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere. in particular, a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where bacon drowns devane in a swimming pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects. the film also has a great soundtrack by jerry goldsmith and classic horror-movie photography by jost vacano. the young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree, but both shue and dickens are impressively out of their depth. this is a great fun nasty movie.

it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased, in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version. true, "hollow man" is a remake of sorts of "the invisible man", but that's where the similarities end. "hollow man" is an entertaining movie,period. if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible, then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place. true, some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable, but "hollow man" manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends. kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible. now his mission is to make them visible again. when this team of young scientists (working, as you might guess, for the pentagon)think they have the formula for making animals visible again, kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug. after that, of course, things go wrong, as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask, so his collaborators know where he is. feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin's character, and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator (elisabeth shue) is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team, he finally snaps. the movie then turns into a hybrid of "alien" and a slasher flick, but that's not saying it's a bad turn. there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace. the special effects are top notch (a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven's films)as we get to see some "body reconstitution" sequences never seen on a movie before. if there's anything to complain about, perhaps, is the predictability of the situations herein; by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end. and the ending is a bit abrupt, but despite this, hollow man is still worth watching. if you want to know what a truly bad movie is, then waste your money on "fear dot com" (with stephen dorf) or the even worse the untold (or "sasquatsh", with land henriksen). now that is "hollow"! 8* out of 10*!

when reading a review from another user, saying that it's a terrible game, i could not stand idle and do nothing!well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real persons, full of humour sense and credibility!), to the story, i find it very good! i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions, when riding the bike, here and there...except that, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, excellent characters, great soundtrack... i recommend it! surely! it can be a bit old, but still enjoyable! at least, on the dreamcast... but the ps2 version shall be the same.

look, this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world. to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. i remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty. the economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. out of that confusion came a hero, stroker ace. ned beatty's performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness. his triumph is an inspiration to all. the on-screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer. jim nabors is a poet. go see this movie tonight!

i love old burt reynolds movies. they're funnier and better than every other movie combined. they might as well have stopped making movies after "cannonball run 2", but i guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? man this movie's good. burt reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant loni anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. burt and loni, those were the days! i used to have this magazine that had loni anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. i sure loved that advertisement! plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something stroker ace (burty r.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night! if you can find this movie, rent it! and then never watch another movie again, because i tell you right now: there's no point.

this is a hilarious film. burt reynolds is a nascar star who signs a sponsorship contract with ned beatty's chicken pit restaurants. the contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! jim nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. loni anderson (oh, yeah!) is assigned by beatty to keep reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract. this is a funny film in which burt proves that he ain't too proud. i like it!

from the view of a nascar maniac like i am, the movie is interesting. you can see many race cars from 1983. even tough, the racing scenes are not that much realistic. but i have to admit, that i haven't seen any race before 1995, because before that time, they didn't show any nascar races in germany)from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am, the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the 80's: burt behind the wheel of a fast car, like in his bandit movies.if you love nascar and burt reynolds, this movie is a must-see. if you only love one of this 2 things, i also recommend to watch it. if you like neither nascar nor burt reynolds, you still should give it a chance, but remember, this movie was far away from winning an oscar academy award.it is the typical humor of the 80's. if you like movies like the cannonball movies, and police academy, you will also like that one.

when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant! however, on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film-making. this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history.the opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment.sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal, revenge and the importance of companionship. this movie is any director's dream at its very core.however, sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking. the writing, provided by scribe tim sheridan, was just as breathtaking.the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. specifically speaking, the final scene (warning: spoilers!!! spoilers!!!) where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen. sheridan is the next robert towne.in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat.therefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer. never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail. a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easy.all in all this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. this is the art of film at its best. when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more.the romeo division is groundbreaking, a masterpiece and, most importantly, the romeo division is indeed art.

i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie. bravo "the spaz", bravo! this movie is a ridiculous farce of film-making. especially for a student film! i just want to give credit to the spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture, and then to comment on it! most people i know don't have that kind of time, especially so few will end of reading it. kudos to you sir! anyway, the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly. i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlie's angels but why hire such atrocious actresses! also, what kind of director has himself act, write, produce and also edit the picture! choose one job and put all your love into it man! it's such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. again, thanks to the spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film, people like you are a rare find.

i love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! it is that damn good! i am not much of a fan of movies but i gotta tell you this one opened my eyes. astounding color and fast energy. i was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the zoinks! film festival in boston, and the story really enveloped me from the start. it had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended i wanted more. i hope they make a sequel. that would be fun. my only problem with it is the performance of melissa connor as anya. ugh! she sucks! i've seen a block of wood pull out a better performance. i don't what the director was thinking when he cast her. but if you ignore her you can't help but give this movie a big ten!!!

my mother and i were on our way home from a trip up to the north east (mainly massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in boston. now, i don't know much about film so i thought this might be a bit educational. the first movie we saw was this one, the romeo division. now, i don't know about you but i thought this was great! i'm from texas and where i come from we don't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise. my mother insisted that it was too violent, but said that i didn't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture. i was shocked by the fight sequences they were great. also, i am a big fan when the good guys win so i was thrilled when romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys. this was true brilliance. i'm not sure when it's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised. a word to the wise though, it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch. it's more for adults.

...here comes the romeo division to change the paradigm.let me just say that i was blown away by this short film. i saw it, randomly, when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since. i really, truly believe i was part of a happening, like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streets.i am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products, but i so hope i can be there for it.again, a truly incredible piece of film making.

the first "side-story" in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies. the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict, but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes.the story does contain some gundam staples, its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam, but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch. this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor, christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman. alfred develops a sort of "brotherly love" for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christina."war in the pocket" proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story. there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here. this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are. alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool. he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war. the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina, each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war, is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff. same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie. that being said, i would not want to spoil much of the story here, but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending. despite its lack of action, this show never falls into the category of "boring". the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show. not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there. each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some "mandatory" mobile suit battles in a gundam series.normally watching anime in japanese or english, i would leave up to personal preference. but in this case, i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one. not only do the characters, whom all except alfred are caucasian, sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one, instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramas.in short, this show does not try to impress the audience. what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child. a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given.

when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with, a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else. this ova is kinda the opposite. though there're only half a dozen episodes, it isn't filled with action, but emotional things. the two main action sequences in this, i believe, are enough to satisfy me. after seeing so many gundam series, movies, and ovas, i was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie. this movie did a fantastic job of that. what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people. it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they're depicted as the second rise of evil nazis. most people that don't like anime that i've forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it. so, i'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story. if you're a gundam fan, and haven't seen this, you shouldn't be reading this; you should already be watching it right now.

uc 0079, the one year war is almost at an end. a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops, a zeon task force. their target, a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes (supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga) inside. when little boy al izuruha, a fan of zeon ms, encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony, he befriends newbie ms pilot benard "bernie" wiseman. the two become good friends, al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team. through the show, bernie acts as a father figure to al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie, but eventually they must meet....in battle. al soon learns that war is not child's play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission.for only 6 episodes, gundam 0080 is a well done show. the mobile suits are extremely well designed, and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters. if you liked 0083 then check this one out, or if you are new to the gundam world, this is a good show to start with. if you look to a show for drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle. i would rate it more of a drama than action.mobile suit gundam 0080, war in the pocket. sometimes you have to lose to win.

if you are uninitiated to the gundam world, this is a good place to start. if you are burned out on star wars or star trek, here is a compelling, realistic sci-fi series you can become immersed in. not the simplistic boy-saves-world-in-giant robot story you might have expected, but rather a complex, emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the "good" and "bad" guys is decidedly less than distinct.gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha, a young, naive boy living in a neutral space colony. he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends. during the course of this series, al befriends an "enemy" soldier, bernie wiseman. by the end, little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice.i loved this oav series, with its cool mecha designs, involving story, and likeable characters. i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime, or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment.

this final voyager episode begins 23 years in the future. voyager has made it back home. in the many years it took to return tho, the vulcan tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. he carried a disease they were too late getting home to cure.captain janeway comes across aliens who have time travel technology. she realizes, there's a warp conduit in the delta quadrant that could bring voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and notify voyager. there's one problem. the conduit is deep inside borg space.janeway visits tuvok. he's like a child. he scribbles tho, obsessed, working on math problems or movie reviews or something, he's convinced are important somehow. in the institution, tuvok cries, asking for 'janeway' to please, please come back to him.janeway decides to commandeer a federation shuttle and equip it with weapons technology 20 years ahead of the borg, in the hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to guide voyager to the warp conduit.when she goes back in time and links up with voyager, janeway meets her younger self. the two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. the real-captain visits tuvok asking him if it's true he has a brain disorder. tuvok admits it's true, but it can't be cured by the facilities on the ship so he's kept it to himself.the young captain agrees to the older captains' plan. to increase their chances of success the older janeway plans to distract the borg with her shuttle craft. the borg actually capture janeway and her shuttle. the borg queen personally assimilates captain janeway. but janeway's expected this! the borg queen has assimilated a virus into herself that kills her. with the borg queen dead voyager makes it thru the warp conduit back to federation space.

i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 2-3 years. thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes. for those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through tng, ds9, voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- "i like the next generation" the best. that's because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation. but to be quiet honest, i appreciate the creativity of voyager's episodes more than tng. voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike tng. granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! endgame portray him as a husband married to an "organic", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before endgame, to disobey captain's order and make "human" mistakes. unlike ds9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, voyager has to survive 3 seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality. of course the rest of the voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, harry kim and tom paris -- very natural. i love tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a vulcan. finally, i'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank god for kate! she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. what a great job! thank you star trek for making voyager, i enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our cosmic expanse.

spoilers. like other posters, i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by "front loading" some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all moot.) i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew. as fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. fortunately, mulgrew(s) pulled it off.

this is a great ending to the show. the fact that adm. janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great. the fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the queen with a "poison" that in, essence, ended the borg was great. the way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. however, they did bring them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic!! it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. ending it with tom and b'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today.

the past few months i have collected voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd (i only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it. am i satisfied with the ending? i think i am. naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. in many ways "endgame" is similar to next gen's "all good things" the involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. a new romance starting in the finale (troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here), which results in death in the future. i truly loved "endgame," fair to all characters, neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. b'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom. tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. the doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe! but of course the captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. the borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager. alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. i feel sorry for susanna thompson though, the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen. maybe she wasn't available though. the special effects are fantastic, the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart! it's very tense. especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection, on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse. voyager could have continued. if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in harry's speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there. and then they could have got home in a film!overall, voyager was a bit hit and miss. the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible! my perception of seven of nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn't true. when she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. and her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. i like her, especially in "someone to watch over me," "imperfection," and "human error." when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. chakotay became my least favourite character. gone was the chemistry with janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time. i loved seeing tom and b'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. i always liked neelix a lot. tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with neelix. harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. the doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates ("tinker, tenor, doctor, spy" is fantastic!). janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it. i wish there was more, i love voyager!

to a certain extent, i actually liked this film better than the original vampires. i found that movie to be quite misogynistic. as a woman and a horror fan, i'm used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre. but they just slap sheryl lee around way too much. in this movie, natasha wagner is a more fully-realized character, and the main bad guy is a gal! arly jover (who played a sidekick vamp in blade) is very otherworldly and deadly. jon bon jovi... okay, yeah, no great actor, but he does ok. at least he doesn't start to sing. catch it on cable if you can. it's on encore action this month.

the main problem of the first "vampires" movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic. carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blade's deacon frost. unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't carpenter use more of this??) this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been. i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence (for example inside a city) and was left somewhat disappointed. while "los muertos" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as "vampires" did). much like "vampires" however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense.most of the above may sound like "los muertos" is a bad movie but it definitely isn't. it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii. it simply could have used a bit more excitement.i'd really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it's probably not going to happen.spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable. una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual.

i admit that i am a vampire addict: i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten. i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it. this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first, and it is not quite so dark, but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original.jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss: his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives. one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems. his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds.the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film. it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night. there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme.if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one. if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.

almost too well done... "john carpenter's vampires" was entertaining, a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects. and obviously aiming on the "from dusk till dawn"-audience. "vampires: los muertos" tries the same starting with a rock-star jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters, but does that almost too well...: i haven't seen jon bon jovi in any other movie, so i am not able to compare his acting in "vampires: los muertos" to his other roles, but i was really suprised of his good performance. after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing "it' my life" or something, but kill vampires, showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done. this means a lot, because a part of the audience (also me) was probably thinking: "...just because he's a rockstar...". of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest: it could have been much worse, and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance. the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killer-machine of a vampire-leader we met in part 1 (or in similar way in "ghosts of mars"). jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy, moving as lithe as a cat, attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin, light almost transparent very erotic cloth. and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made. it really takes some beating. but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnau's "nosferatu". you can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original. this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point: the audience celebrating the fun-bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun-bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed. make no mistake: "vampires:los muertos" is a fun-bloodbath but it's just not all the time this kind of movie. just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins: the bar-massacre is what you expect from american popcorn-entertainment, the seducing-zoey-in-the-ruins-scene is almost european-like cinema (the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress, but refuses answers at the same time. because it would had slow down the action? showed the audience a vampiress with a human past, a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody). and that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not. and also: is the "from dusk till dawn"-audience really going to like this? i'm not sure about that. nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job, "vampires:los muertos" is surprisingly good. but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative, too expressive. like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience. in my opinion, wallace' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time. "vampires: los muertos" is almost too well done. (i give it 7 of 10)

at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance as derek bliss. his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films (the leading man, no looking back). but, in case anyone is still wondering, yes, jon bon jovi can act. he can act well and that's come to be expected of him. it's easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh-1.i generally would not watch a horror movie. i've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot. what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along. the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets. so, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not.unlike an action film like u-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know "the good guys" and actually care what happens to them. a few scenes are left unexplained (like derek's hallucinations) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel. unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film, that sequel will never happen. these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series.is this the best film i've ever seen in my life? no. is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? yes. it won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either. if you're somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover, this film is for you. it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other.

my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter's vampires but i don't care i loved it. jon bon jovi (derek) was great in this movie. he really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous rockstar. there were some bad things about this movie. like the story line,there should have been more to the movie.there should have been a sequel to the movie that followed the movies story line and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampires movies. i really liked the clothes that the people wore and the setting they pick in mexico. i liked how it was old mexico and not new mexico. with the clay houses and the old fashion churches. i was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to walk in churches but it was cool how they didn't follow dracula vampire rules.

the original vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. i was quite surprised at how this played out. as a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. though this one was not a great movie, the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. jon bon jovi was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent slayer. i doubt anyone could top james wood's performance in the first one, though... unless you bring in buffy!all in all, this was a decent watch & i would watch it again.i was left with two questions, though... what happened to jack crow & how did derek bliss come to be a slayer? guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination.

this movie is pretty cheesy, but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it's principles. there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well.the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie.i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran. sure it's not all that well done, but the premise is not at all bad.tom

everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes christopher walken.in vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows, including christopher walken. following a mad max 3 (!) thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.cut to the present (1991), and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente. he's successful at first, but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly, which leads walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of people.mcbain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police bothering.there's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from michael ironside's diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in america (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).it's out there for a quid. buy it if you have a sense of humour. see how many times you can spot the camera crew too.

ah, mcbain the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by "the simpsons" but it will also always  to me personally, at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90's action flick; directed by the cool dude who brought us "the exterminator" and starring two of the most ultimately badass b-movie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside (the latter with a cute little macho ponytail). i guess "mcbain" will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure, because there's no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture. the film is unimaginably preposterous (most action heroes take on a small gangster posse  mcbain takes on an entire country) and yet takes itself way too seriously. the script is a non-stop and incoherent spitfire of clichéd situations, nonsensical twists, compulsory sentimental interludes, grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings. it's a totally delirious movie; i loved it. vietnam pow mcbain's life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war. they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that mcbain is in santos' debt. eighteen years later, santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia. santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he's publicly executed on el presidente's balcony. his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower. mcbain and his former vietnam buddies, who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world, charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of whoop-ass. okay, let's not fool each other here. the fact you're reading a user- comment on "mcbain" already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low-budget b-movie action. one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of "mcbain". this list is totally accurate and i can only concur with it. heck, i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list (like the preposterous and needless heroic self- sacrifice of a soldier who doesn't even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbain's squad), but what's the point? you definitely know not to expect a 100% coherent and plausible masterpiece. we know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie, and it's maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out! this is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel. please don't expect another "apocalypse now". this particular motion picture relies on the ruff 'n tuff acting performances of the macho leads, a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings a cover of "brothers in arms".

i don't have much to add to my summary, this film ranks right up the there with top gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be. i for one don't think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable.i don't think it brings christopher walken's reputation down either as his reputation was on the wane back then anyway. it took pulp fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in. as for michael ironside, he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films. total recall, top gun. what i think is amazing is the budget this movie had. the scenes and actors and explosions etc. are quite amazing so obviously someone liked it quite a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. whoever he or she was i like them because i love this film! if anyone reads this looking for information on mcbain (and i seriously doubt there'll be too many) just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face!

first of all i'd just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels. mcbain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle. it has all of the classic elements of a late 80's/early 90's action film....the random gratuitous acts of violence (ie. when walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money), the snapping of necks, the guys on fire, the guys that get blown off buildings, and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings. walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as, "let's go sit..........out on the deck." and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store. if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.

when i first heard about the title, i thought of 'the simpsons', just like so many other reviewers, but when i saw the cast, i was completely stunned, that so many great character-actors would actually be in this! first of all, we have christopher walken (deer hunter, pulp fiction), who plays the title character, mcbain. he is rescued from a vietnam pow-camp by some of his buddies, one of which is santos (chick vennera, yanks), who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain (vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently), and tells him that he can re-do the favor to him, if he ever gets into trouble.then, 18 years later, santos and his sister christina (maria conchita alonso, the running man, predator 2) join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, el presidente (victor argo, taxi driver, king of new york), and when santos fails the mission, christina goes to mcbain for help.mcbain then asks his good ol' vietnam buddies to help him. first there's the token tough black guy, eastland, played by "american ninja"'s steve james, who was also in director james glickenhaus' previous movie, "the exterminator", where the exterminator's real name also was eastland, coincidence? i think not. there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator, among other things, the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a welders-mask when christina sees him for the first time, when he is working on a welding-job on top of a bridge! the other guys in the vietnam-pack are: the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team, frank bruce (michael ironside, total recall, starship troopers), and then there's the doc, dalton, (played by jay patterson, who doesn't look like the guy the imdb is linking to, and i haven't seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there's the cop, gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfying job, he's played by thomas g. waites, who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thing.and in other big roles, we find luis guzmán (boogie nights, carlito's way), as a small-time drug-dealer who can't get a decent job. also, there is dick boccelli as the drug-dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbain-gang, almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat-grinder by john eastland in the exterminator-movie! now, i haven't seen glickenhaus' "shakedown/blue jean cop" yet, but i'm almost ready to bet half a hundred-dollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too! well, back to the plot of this movie.. they go off to colombia and saves the day, yay! but who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action-scenes are very well done, and you're never bored while watching this movie! highly recommended to all action-lovers!

this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it. i wouldn't say that it is very scary, but more fun i guess. that is if you like horror movies. scarecrow kind of remembered me of "children of the corn", but still not. if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch =)

i don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality. yes the scarecrow is a kung-fu fighting frightner, but why not? no one else is willing to go that far. i really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since candyman. so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow, even his mom doesn't care about him. then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow, who then goes on a killing spree. his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going. the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool, these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre. over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs, with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick. i would say, grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a$$ off with this movie. i love it for its originality, most fun.

there wasn't a day in 2002 where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow i felt that this film handled a serious issue wellit brought back a lot of memories as it was so realisticeven today i have nightmares about corn on the cob, and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my lifei have to admit though, at one point in the film i did have to turn it off as it hit too close to homefor those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn, believe me, i've been there and i have the scars watch the film, its amazing and educational

this film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts. average montage scenes, 30-somethings playing teenagers, and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the "new-wave" of modern classics. as a viewer, i came away from the film with the same sense of "shock and awe" as when i first saw the godfather in 1969. tiffany gardner's startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt judy was deserving of her grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen by ricky martin and restless hips. unfortunately, the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the godfather series which got better with each installment, and should culminate in 2012 with godfather 4: eat my rage.

what a fun b-movie! shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is a distinct and original. he really brought me back to the monsters of the 80's. the budget is obviously low and not everybody is pacino behind the lens but it doesn't matter because it never once takes itself seriously. from the trailer trash redneck to the high flying martial arts moves of the scarecrow, this is truly a b-movie gem. grab some refreshments, snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax. i enjoyed this film so much i went out a purchased all 3 scarecrow films. sure, they're not for everybody but to each his own. sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile.

this movie is not your typical horror movie. it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical. i personally liked the movie because of its off-beat humor. it's definetely not a super scary movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester... very believable. i think i'm going to dye my hair red like that girl in scarecrow- very cool! anyway, overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience.

this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic. much much better than 90% of the scream rip-offs out there! i even hope they come up with a sequel!

first off i'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over-the-top. a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would've made this movie much less cheesy. but overall i think it's one of the better b-movies. tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. though this movie is missing the all-important nude factor, there are several other movies at which to view her. but here she gets all evil-hotness, especially towards the end as she's walking away from the engulfed scarecrow. also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend. yes it's a low budget b-movie. but out of all of them i've seen, this is definitely one of my very top favorites.

verry classic plot but a verry fun horror movie for home movie party really gore in the second part this movie proves that you can make something fun with a small budget. i hope that the director will make another one

the scarecrow was on of the funniest killers i have ever seen in the act! plus he's really bouncy most of the time he jumped around, which was awesome! also he had an excellent voice i mean it was just perfect for him. the story lines was excellent too. i like how the kids soul was transferred into scarecrow that was cool! plus he did have a reason for all that killing i mean after what those people did to him.....i would be angry too! scarecrows look was really good! his look gives that person an "omg!" reaction when they see him! which was great the stares he got were funny! those people were stupid, who would stare for that long! they should of glanced and ran for their lives...even though that wouldn't of made a difference!

1958. the sleepy small southern town of clarksburg. evil sheriff roy childress (the almighty vic morrow in peak nasty form) cracks down super hard on speeders by forcing said offenders off a cliff to their untimely deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road. childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver michael mccord (a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by martin sheen) shows up in town in his souped-up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (sheen's real-life sibling joe estevez in a brief cameo). director richard t. heffron, working from a taut and intriguing script by richard compton (the same guy who directed the 70's drive-in movie gems "welcome home, soldier boys" and "macon county line"), relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, neatly creates a flavorsome 50's period setting, and ably milks plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and wills between childress and mccord. the uniformly fine cast helps a lot: sheen radiates a brash james deanesque rebellious vibe in the lead, morrow makes the most out of his meaty bad guy part, plus there are excellent supporting performances by michelle phillips as sweet diner waitress maggie, stuart margolin as a folksy deputy, nick nolte as amiable gas station attendant buzz stafford, gary morgan as buzz's endearingly gawky younger brother lyle, janit baldwin as sassy local tart sissy, britt leach as stingy cab driver johnny, and frederic downs as the stern judge j.a. hooker. the climactic vehicular confrontation between childress and mccord is a real pulse-pounding white-knuckle thrilling doozy. terry k. meade's sharp cinematography, the well-drawn characters (for example, childress became obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident), the groovy, syncopated score by luchi de jesus, and the beautiful mountainside scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made-for-tv winner.

i caught this movie about 8 years ago, and have never had it of my mind. surely someone out there will release it on video, or hey why not dvd! the ford coupe is the star.......if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away.

martin sheen, michelle phillips, stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. mr. sheen, mr. margolin and mr. morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles; ms. phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made-for-tv movie (twenty-five years ago), by supplying the "sex interest" in an otherwise sexless film. the real star, however, is the "california kid"; a 1934 ford coupe, borrowed from "jake" jacobs, put before a camera and given a workout that'll leave the viewer panting, gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation.the action scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialog is a bit lame) making for a fine evening's diversion. this is how all "car movies" should be made.try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it's well worth the missed sleep.

for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et. al., martin sheen showed us the way in this great feature.the premise is easy enough: cool hood meets small town sheriff and all-hell ensues, but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us. no, this isn't casablanca, nor is it great literature, but it is a serious movie about cars, rebellion, and the genius that is martin sheen.enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is, and for what martin will become. i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70's, and you will too.

i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. it is far superior in action than most movies since. martin sheen is excellent, and though nick nolte has a small part, he too provides excellent support. vic morrow as the villain is superb.when sheen "tests the water" in his '34 ford (cool) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!the ending is grand.i'm disappointed in the low vote this received. i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days.good taste eludes the masses!

in 1958, clarksberg was a famous speed trap town. much revenue was generated by the sheriff's department catching speeders. the ones who tried to outrun the sheriff? well, that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the clarksberg curve with his plymouth cruiser. for example, in the beginning of the movie, a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths, if i recall correctly. then one day, a stranger drove into town. possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world. michael mccord. even his name is a car name, as in mccord gaskets. in possibly the ultimate hot rod. a black flamed '34 ford coupe. the colors of death, evil and hellfire. he gets picked up for speeding by the sheriff on purpose. he checks out the lay of the land. he is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. he knows how his brother died. the clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff. there's only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so "this ain't a-ever gonna happen again to anyone": recreate the chase and settle the contest hot-rodder style to the death. he goes out to the curve and practices. the sheriff knows mccord knows. the race begins... this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road.

forget neo and bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. they only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones, hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick.however, their " action set-pieces " are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question. this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years. for better ( rocky, rambo ) or worse ( die hard 4 - where john mcclane, brace yourselves.... had no beard !! )i say it is high-time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end. this " largo winch " movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero. and the only one time where he was weakened is when mélanie thierry shaved his beard ! i rest my case.i didn't know it when i entered the theater room, but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade. for the first time in france since belmondo, can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in b-genre without blushing over its performance. in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience... in other words it was " le pacte des loups " or " dobermann " ( i like dobermann, mind you )... i believe " largo winch " has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making.i exited the theater room very pleased, and hungry for more.

when i sat down to watch 'largo winch' i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. when i stood up, i've seen both of these; and more.karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie, to start with. kristin scott thomas played her role well, but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic, both acting superbly. in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well.the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but i understand why people would get bored with it.the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me, and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island.rolls royce phantom; mercedes s500, and bmw 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; this is their movie. it is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extremal beauty, and above all, a fast - paced, well written action movie, with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama.my vote, as it has enlightened a gloomy day is: 10/10

i'm not aware of "largo winch" as a comic book (or is it graphic novel? i actually don't know), but i have to admit, hearing about an agent/hero movie, i did expect quite something different, than what i actually got.while it was startling to watch this at first, it was nice watching this move along. you could never really tell where it would go (some twists are foreseeable, but in general, you can never really say, were it will end up going). a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast, make this an enjoyable watch. not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that, but a really good mixture.

who doesn't know largo winch in the france-belgium-luxemburg trio (the three countries where the french "bd" or "bandes dessinées" are massively published) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. after a first - and failed- attempt with a tv show, the real thing begins.first of all, and that's what most of the fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. as a 1st class-fan of the comic book, i must confess i was nicely surprised. the actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast. i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial/political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet.

not a bad martial arts film. fight scenes were good. michel qissi did a good job directing his first film without van damme. story worked without foul language and too much blood. screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story that works. it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. she likes the art and having strong women promenant. it was definitely worth watching. i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.

did not know what to expect from from van damme's partner & friend /trainer/and his fight choreographer for most of his films. it was nice to see him act as "tong po" in "kickboxer and other van damme's films. now he's on his own. he and his wife make a great team. in this one qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and he's good. really meanacing. his wife was the writer, producer and directed most of the scenes which didn't require action. she also did good job editing the film. together they did a great job. the story made sense, the fight scenes were edited well, the leads were real fighters and looked good together - the story came together well, and if you can beleive it...no bad language, no sex, just action. a new one on me. check it out!!!

jeff wincott is not only a hunk, he can kick butt! this movie has some of the best martial arts moves i've seen in a very long time. ok, so maybe bridgette nielson isn't the first person i'd hire to play a ruthless politician, she did a great job nontheless! and let's not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert/stuntwoman karen sheperd. so she's not cynthia rothrock, who cares?! she's just as good, if not better! (just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie, one word: ouch!!). my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you haven't seen it, you're really missing out on some great martial arts action.

this movie (with the alternate title "martial law 3" for some reason) introduced me to jeff wincott for the first time. and it was a great introduction. although i had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. the action scenes in this movie are great! there are lots of them too, by the way. the recruit fight at the peacekeepers hq is especially good. there's just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that's really fun. and for the rest of the cast: brigitte nielsen was a good choice for the villain. roles like this fits her (but others don't). matthias hues also did a good job, as always. he's a great fighter and macho-like character, and was a good rival for wincott in this movie.

i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable. the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn. in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (perhaps for sex as well, but not on indian tv, anyway.)not being a fan of the genre i couldn't place jeff wincott, and had no leads to search from. only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her.this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la paul verhoeven. can we add a genre tag for "so-bad-it's-good"?

the plot:kurt harris (jeff wincott), a bitter, ex-cop goes undercover in the "peacemakers" after his friend is killed by their leader. while there, he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor, and will do anything to achieve this goal, even murder.the cast is good(jeff wincott is a good martial artist and good actor)...brigitte nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays matthias hues also him good martial artist.the direction is good(the fight scenes also).the rest is ok, with tony burton who plays a friend of kurt killed from nilsen,and cyndi pass plays a bad girl.from producers of another action/martial arts film(bounty tracker with lorenzo lamas)a good action film.the best film of martial law series.

this movie really rocks! jeff wincott is terrific in the film! his fighting incredible! he is such a fast martial artist! brigitte nielsen & matthias hues was very good! mission of justice is an action packed movie that is never boring! if you like fighting movies with incredible non stop action then check out mission of justice today!

it's a great american martial arts movie. the fighting scenes were pretty impressive for american movie made in 90's. of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in honk kong movies, actually only few american movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in honk kong movies, even nowadays. when you watch american martial arts movie, you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes, but still having some nice moves, which can be surprisingly good sometimes, or at least that's what i'm expecting from these movies. i was impressed by this film. some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, direction and the plot were good enough, so it's a really worth watching movie, if you like american martial arts films of the 90's.

just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me, was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say, yes the acting is cheesy, some of the effects are laughable.but you have to remember this was meant to be 1898 not 2005, and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good. i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last week.i have read the book so many times, and found myself going "ahh yes that's in the book" almost all the time, with the other version hardly anything of the book existed.so well done for at least trying to make a true version.

pendragon pictures' new film "h g wells' war of the worlds", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (march, 2005) but this never happened. the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielberg's version, which hits theatres june 29.i liked this film, with certain reservations.how faithful is the adaptation? it's not quite 100% faithful to wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me. at least several scenes were totally new, such as ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin. but on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george pal.its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. the majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds. this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets. the overviews of 1898 london look like something from a video game. numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- i guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. the only scenes shot for "real" seem to be those in open fields or forests.but within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. artistically, the film looks right. the martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to wells' descriptions. i was particularly impressed with the heat ray. although the thunder child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing. it's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation.the acting and direction won't win any oscars. for the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. the music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composers.i'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen. as it stands, i would rate this similarly to a bbc-tv adaptation of classic literature.a few nitpicks: most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). this may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd. and the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.bottom line -- is it worth seeing? if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, i think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original h g wells novel. if, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a mst3k fan). be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so i don't recommend watching it all in one sitting.btw: an entirely different version of war of the worlds (aka "invasion") came out on dvd the same month that spielberg's hit the theatres: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. this was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film - but it's much better! and to top it off, jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978, but that won't be out until 2007.

the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h. g. wells' great novel, "war of the worlds". this is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them. no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th century, 1900  using wells' original setting, in and near woking, england.imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as "spoilers". that might apply with some films, where the ending might actually be a surprise, but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world, it seems positively silly. i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature, so let's get right to the chase. the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease, against which they have no immunity. if that's a spoiler, so be it; after a book and 3 other films (including the 1953 classic), you ought to know how this ends.this film, which follows wells' plot in the main, is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th century photography. although filmed in a widescreen aspect, the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting. at other times, colors are washed out. these variations are typical of early films, which didn't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality, even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on  as you'll see on occasion here. the special effects are deliberately retrograde, of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s  and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic "feel". some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of big ben. the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd, particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair.this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells' original narrative  as has been noted. viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story. wells' description of the martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed. when the martian machines appear, about an hour into the film, they too give a good impression of how wells described them. both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural england  plus a few scenes in london (involving the narrator's brother). the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (big ben), but at least doesn't dwell unduly on the devastation of london.the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise, despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines. the narrator, traveling about to seek escape, sees much of what wells terms "the rout of mankind". he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality. they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest, where they discover an awful fact: the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene. wells adds that after eating they set up "a prolonged and cheerful hooting". the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder (cheers from the gallery; british curates are so often utterly insufferable).this film lasts almost 3 hours, going through wells' story in welcome detail. it's about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact. a word about the acting: don't expect award-winning performances. they're not bad, however, the actors are earnest and they grow on you. most of them, however, have had very abbreviated film careers, often only in this film. the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana, in his 2nd film. the curate is john kaufman  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing. the brother ("henderson") is played with some conviction by w. bernard bauman in his first film. the artilleryman, the only other sizable part, is played by james lathrop in his first film.this is overall a splendid film, portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it. despite its slight defects, it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors. if you want to see h. g. wells' war of the worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film!

i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i've every seen. it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it. in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better. but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up. and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it.thank you

all of the people reviewing this film, and probably many professional film reviewers, just don't get it. this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker, karel zeman. if you want to know what i'm talking about, i suggest you get any of zeman's films, such as the fabulous world of jules verne, baron munchausen, journey to the beginning of time, or on the comet. if you are unable to locate a film, then read the reviews in amg. they will explain the processes used. if one were to look at zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time, viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either. it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both zemen and hines "do not compute". they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. it isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. i thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. hines took a great gamble, and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing, rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work. regarding the actors, i think hines also took a page from zemen's book, in that many of zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first, but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. i will watch it for years to come, all three great hours of it.

i have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of h.g. wells' classic novel, "war of the worlds". timothy hines has finally done it! i just couldn't believe how good it was! from the acting, to the costuming, the out-of-this world special effects, i just can't say enough!it was wonderful! dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performances by a top-notch cast! it's got to be seen to be believed. i sure didn't. and i've read all those negative comments by the others, and can't believe what they were saying. we must've been watching a different movie, huh? and those real bad comments by that vepsaian guy, guy whoever he is, well, he just doesn't know what he's talking about.keep up the good work, mr. hines.

this movie is a lot better than the asylums version mainly its war of the worlds. the tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better. the action scenes were really cool. walking... walking...walking...walking!!! oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself. the thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed bunch of tripods. good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book. the music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty cool.pros. good soundtrack 99% to the book cool violence tripods and handling machines are cool to look atcons. some bad acting cheesy looking london

the h.g. wells classic has had several incarnations. the 05' speilburg version and the classic 53' version but only this one stays completely true to the book. nothing is changed nothing is removed.originally released as a 3-hour film. the director re-cut the film down to 2-hours of pure excellence. its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that "wells would be proud of" the story is as everyone remembers. martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines. the people of 19th century earth are ill-prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth.the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget. today b-movies have larger budgets.

i didn't mind all the walking. people really did walk places back then. it loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the martians. i too was disappointed by the effects, in particular the "thunderchild" scene, which i regard as one of the most exciting in the book. but i can't praise this film enough, for its faithfulness to wells's story! it's about time. the actors are likable and the performances are charming. also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear jamie hall's truly great musical score. it was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in london.

"the classic war of the worlds" by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h. g. wells' classic book. mr. hines succeeds in doing so. i, and those who watched his film with me, appreciated the fact that it was not the standard, predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. those who envision themselves as amateur "critics" look only to criticize everything they can. others rate a movie on more important bases,like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the "critics". we enjoyed the effort mr. hines put into being faithful to h.g. wells' classic novel, and we found it to be very entertaining. this made it easy to overlook what the "critics" perceive to be its shortcomings.

for a long time, 'the menagerie' was my favorite 'star trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'city on the edge of forever.' what i used to prefer about 'menagerie' was that it's more hard-core star trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current trek storyline. i still think it's fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of spock being court-martialed is a clever one. you can poke holes in the plot if you want. for instance, given the talosians' mind-control abilities and captain pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet? and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st's only two-parter.

imagine that you could have anything you wanted, go anywhere you wished, be anything you'd ever dreamed of being - through thought alone. now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life. what would you do? would such powers be worth your soul? this is the dilemma presented to captain christopher pike in "the cage" the now-legendary pilot episode of the original star trek series. famously deemed "too cerebral" and "too cold" by nbc brass and rejected, "the cage" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and gene roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic star trek episode, which embeds "the cage" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in tv history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen...star date 3012: the uss enterprise diverts to starbase 11 after mr. spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the enterprise. surprisingly, the message cannot be from captain pike after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident. kirk and starbase commanding officer commodore mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery, but before the matter can be cleared up, spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny, kidnapping the helpless captain pike and hijacking the enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few vulcan nerve pinches. soon, the enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of talos iv. mendez informs kirk that talos iv is under interdiction, and any contact with the planet by starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence, meaning that spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself, and kirk as well, given that the captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities. appalled, kirk and mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft, which itself becomes dangerous when the enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone. spock - knowing that kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the captain to certain death. after ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard, spock reveals what he has done to mccoy and demands to be arrested, after having set the starship on an irreversible course to talos iv. upon reassuming command, kirk demands an explanation, whereupon spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - mendez, kirk, and the crippled invalid captain pike. spock's encyclopedic knowledge of starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence. spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the federation and the inhabitants of talos iv - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the enterprise itself under pike's command. kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to talos iv by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously. among the survivors is vina, a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster. pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot, whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the talosians, a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality. after pike's capture, the rest of the "survivors" vanish as none of them really existed except vina. the episode ends when the tribunal learns that spock's "evidence" is in fact being transmitted to the enterprise directly from talos iv, in violation of starfleet regulations. starfleet orders an immediate halt to the transmissions, and we wonder what will happen next...to be continued in a review of "the menagerie: part ii"!

it is a well known fact that when gene roddenberry first pitched star trek to nbc, the original pilot episode, the cage, was rejected for being "too cerebral". when the series was given another chance, roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon, and did so by writing the menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still, at the time, an unaired episode.this time, rather than exploring a new planet, kirk and his crew are on starbase 11, paying a visit to the former commander of the enterprise, christopher pike (sean kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. pike joins his successor on the starship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: spock, who used to serve under pike, has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for talos iv, a planet which is off-limits (the punishment is death) since pike and spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. naturally, being a logical creature, spock turns himself in and arranges a court-martial so that he can justify his actions.there's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will play out in part 2. what really impresses is how roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe, by coming up with a particular type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what could have been of trek, had nbc not turned down the original project. in particular, it's fun to see jeffrey hunter (who was unable to return in the menagerie) play pike as a more serious captain than kirk usually is and nimoy's early days as spock, whose personality hadn't been fully established yet: this is the only time in the entire series that everybody's favorite vulcan spontaneously grins.in short, not just a great "mystery" episode, but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down the cage in its original form (it's available as part of the season 3 box set).

in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes, the tag line was "is it real or is it memorex?" the same might be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of "the cage," the first pilot of star trek. mr. spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet talos iv in order to allow capt. christopher pike, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, to return there. why the finagling? because to have any contact at all with talos iv invites a death sentence. why this is so is never explained - that bothered me tremendously - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. after he has gotten the ship to travel to talos iv, mr. spock turns himself in to dr. mccoy (the senior-most officer present; capt. kirk was off the ship) for arrest and says, "the charge is mutiny, dr.; i never received orders to take over the ship." what follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the talosians - we learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for capt. pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr. spock's death. the illusions the talosians create, the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic. and meg wyllie as the keeper (the head talosian) is wonderful. call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect! the talosians, having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can't really tell if they're male or female and it really doesn't matter. this episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced! what a neat thing if this were so! this is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times i've seen it (i even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly.

the menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot "the cage." the move was made out of necessity, to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced (such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time). one positive outcome back then was that audiences, unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier, were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters, as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history (though they still used terms such as 'united space fleet' in these early episodes).the wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot: the enterprise is diverted to starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans. astonishingly, though even mccoy belabors the fact that spock's vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible, it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain, pike, now horribly crippled. well, spock is half human, we tend to forget. or has he simply gone mad? it may very well be, for he's directing enterprise to talos iv, a planet so off-limits it's the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleet's books. when the jig is up, there's a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy, as uhura looks on in shock. even kirk, usually steady as a captain should be, doesn't know what to make of his first officer's illogical conduct.in the 3rd and final acts, we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from 13 years prior, when capt. pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers. we really don't know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish - and that's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it's all about in the 2nd part. not only is spock facing severe penalties, but it looks like kirk's career may be finished, as well. double jeopardy, folks. this is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts (none were available in the earlier "the enemy within" when the crafts were really needed). there's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then. finally, check out kirk's smug approach at the start of the episode - boy, do things go sideways on him as the story progresses.

i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didn't have the best time mainly because i didn't know about ned kelly or his story.but since this is a biopic, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character.i don't know if the manner the events are told are true, or if it everything is fictional. but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true. i don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion.this is a solid western-type movie for everybody's tastes. heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen.give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. otherwise, i don't think i could recommend it.

fantastic movie. one to excite all 5 senses. is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. true hollywood conventions used, like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as naomi watts (julia cook - ned kelly's lover), heath ledger (ned) and orlando bloom (joe byrne - ned's right hand man), and unattractive (sorry geoffrey rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force. this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned (ledger) and julia cook (watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. even from the first scene, when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder," it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly, the underdog. besides, don't all aussies love an underdog?

i'm tired of people judging films on their "historical accuracy". it's a movie people!! the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story! there are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the history....braveheart, wyatt earp, gangs of new york, geronimo: an american legend, the last of the mohicans....all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically. if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best, then i suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts. just enjoy the quality of the film, the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time.

i thought that this film was very well made, heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless. orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable. how true it is to what really happened i have no idea, but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do. maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought? in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film. all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn't do better in the cinemas.

definitely one of my favourite movies. the story is good, acting is great, all technicals (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever.heath ledger is terrific as edward ''ned'' kelly. he is gripping as the legendary outlaw, and is supported well by geoffrey rush, naomi watts and orlando bloom. all action sequences are on pointthe film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end. one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger, who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in. and makes no mistake here.an excellent film all round.

i didn't know what to expect from 'ned kelly', but absolutely loved it. it was dark, dramatic and gripping. it also felt very authentic, i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800's. i've never been much of a heath ledger fan, having only seen him in teen type movies, however he is quite compelling in this role. ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia's most notorious killer. naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly's society lover. highly recommended - and that's from an aussie!

the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom. simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. it's not bad, but it's really not very good. the editing is good; the film is well-paced. the direction is competent and assured. the story is plodding. the film is averagely acted by ledger, bloom, and the normally great watts and rush. the accents are impenetrable if you're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as i like to call it, orlando bloom). by the end of the film, i was neither bored nor moved. some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie. i have to say, i so did not care by that point.really, the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of, sort of shows some hints of range (although the oft-present "i'm pretty and confused" look is prominent), so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price. other than that, just don't see it. it's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining.

the film notes describe the main role family, as turkish immigrants which living in denmark. however, it is so clear to understand that the fact is, the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute kurdish. similar social pressures and even cultural murders keep going on turkey today on kurdish ethnicity societies. what a worry...it is widely accepted issue in turkey today, the kurdish immigrants living in european countries today, which have moved from turkey at 70's are culturally connected to the feudal moral laws system, by growing daughters and women under pressure, are giving harm to the turkish international image. also, as same as widely accepted another issue is the turkish or kurdish immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the community europe nominee.

cinematography--compared to 'the wrestler,' a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer, and then hypnotizes as well.acting--the dialogue is minimal, but the pauses and silence poignant.story--the conflict in a 'balkanized' denmark is volatile, as we saw recently jihad murders in the netherlands and riots in france. while i harbor no love for islam, the departure from the west from christian values holds no cause for celebration.the director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither, emphasizing the development of aicha as an individual who became a champion, not so much in the ring, but to all those around her. even her worst . . . i will stop here to avoid the spoiler.

it's a rather good movie, but too americanised in it's predictability. change the kung fu for football and the turkish family for a pakistani one, and you get to watch bend it like beckham (2002) almost scene for scene. a nice feature the serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway, beginning with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against oneself, as the kung fu master stressed several times. on a different level, the danish life is revealed quite different than the image it has by outsiders: the non indigenous immigrants that make a large proportion (actually, the majority) of the danish citizenry, the graffiti in the copenhagen suburbs, the taunting of the immigrant girl in the begging of the movie. all portray a different picture than one has in mind when one hears the word denmark.

when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low, but i was pleasantly surprised. i thought i was going to watch a boring teen-flick, but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie, and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done .i think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received. it is a movie, which can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of kids, since it contains some rather rough scenes. a movie about love, and the problems that can occur, when you go against your family traditions. yes, the movie is very much like "bend it like beckham", but i actually think this movie pulls it off better.

when you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, go watch this film. it shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting, and it is very encouraging, in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspective.when you know both the turkish language and either the danish or the german language, go watch the film in any case. half of the dialog is danish in the original, synchronized to german in the translated version, the other half turkish, subtitled in danish or german, respectively. when i watched it in mannheim, germany, the reaction of the turkish-speaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the turkish dialog, which, deplorably, mostly escaped me, being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles. still, the film is interesting even if you lack knowledge of the turkish.esthetically, the movie is playing a lot on the theme of speed and slowness. on first sight, there is lots of corporeal movement fast as lightning, making it a quick, an agitated film. in particular, even though this is a kung fu movie, watch out for the running scenes, beautifully expressing a wealth of emotions. but there are quite a few very slow, emotionally intense scenes, too. and above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age; still, there is some movement in the characters to: closely watch the villain omar, whose part and acting i liked very much.the contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the depiction of human rage and dignity - shown at once, in the same characters, at the same time.

when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and didn't plan on changing it. but this movie is a dramatic powerhouse. i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward. so what have we? theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in copenhagen, denmark. it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from "bend it like beckham", where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister. here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing kung fu. and we have a love story and a competition of course, too. after i accepted this, this really turned out to be a gripping, emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu (i'm not an expert, though). the lead actress semra turan is not only denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance, so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress. rest of the supporting cast is okay, camera good, kung fu intense. sidenotes: - the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right. - the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge. - xian gao, a chinese cinematic kung fu instructor/actor (hidden tiger, crouching dragon) played the lead role's masterif you get the chance to see this in cinema do it, you'll probably have a good and intense experience and i don't know if this works on small screen as well

a beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get. semra turan plays aicha, a second generation turkish immigrant, who tries to break the mold. neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative muslim family, nor with her liberal danish friends, aicha's martial arts experience becomes a fight to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and friends.director natasha arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming ponderous philosophical discourse, and drawing on xian gao's choreography skills pays off in spectacular fight sequences. in the end, however, it is semra turan's stunning debut performance that gives this movie spirit. raw charisma and requisite martial arts skills are complimented by heart to make her personal drama believable.well worth your while.

how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together? well, i couldn't and so, i rented this mess of a movie.i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young man's legend. i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow, i found this story difficult to follow. not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. even with a slow story, ledger and bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. though i flounder to recommend this as a must see, it is a great story of australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences. 6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )

i loves this movie,because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved! heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe. it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that. the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there. this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers! i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one. there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at! also that that is how people remember them,from their armor. i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have.

'ned kelly' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero. we are taken into the world of ned, his best friend, joe byrne, and the other members of the kelly gang, as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned's actions.there is an exceptional cast present, who all give stellar performances, which brings the film to life. (great job, heath!) orlando bloom was fantastic as joe, playing the role of quiet, loyal ladiesman very well. i was swept up in the moment. for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan, alas, it was not to be.some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid ned kelly fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed by this. perhaps also the film could've gone longer, to cover more of the kelly gang's/ned's life - i felt not enough was covered.regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving film, which stirs all sorts of emotions. (and hey, i'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned...)

i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. when i saw the trailer for the first time, i could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure). heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. not to mention orlando bloom ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. i think that this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again my many people.

indeed: drug use, warehouse shoot-'em-ups, 'matrix'-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of asian races, and a lonely vampire --all in the same movie-- seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a japanese pop/rock star. and that is exactly what 'moon child' is, and more. while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy b-movie of the week, 'moon child' pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the way.the film has a gritty, definitely independent feel to it, jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving glimpses into the characters' lives and barely scraping at a true plot. but the film makes no excuses, instead turning the story into one of friendship, love, trust, and betrayal all sugar-coated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, warring gangsters, and vampires.hyde as the somber vampire 'kei' is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing-out the overly-zealous acting of gackt as 'sho,' an orphan who befriends kei. lee-hom wang also shines as the vengeful 'son' who becomes friends with a grown-up sho. the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives, and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal.while the action at times is all-too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show-off, one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features. the superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. the movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. 'moon child' is rather enjoyable, humorous at times, and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!

i picked this up in the 'danger after dark' box set, and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt. i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america. instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that sho (gackt) develops through the movie as a person. the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards.on a side note, taro yamamoto's performance was very surprising. the only other film i've seen him in is battle royale, where he plays shogo kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo. toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. so, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with battle royale, you'll be very surprised by him.but don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. it's just a movie with a vampire in it. that hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. it's a really moving picture at some points, the photography is really well done. it's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at blockbuster.

this film was amazing. it had an original concept (that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film). it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship, love, immortality, death, and happiness, and comments subtelly on society. on the part of gackt camui, the role of sho was excellently delivered, and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire, kei. i also laughed and cried at the happy-go-lucky character, toshi, who grew up with sho. i loved each and every second of this this film, especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene, the fighting scenes, and most of all, the heartrenching ending.

those who know who know the kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. naomi watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best ned (not hard considering the previous ned's include yahoo serious, mick jagger & former carlton champion (australian rules football) bob chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. some location shooting film in the area i live, bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes & ballarat.

...would probably be the best word to describe this film (in my opinion). besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls (well, that was redundant~), it was the story that blew me away. hurray for takahisa zeze and gackt! and i know some people will disagree with me on this one, but it wasn't any of the big three actors (the guys that played sho, son, and kei) that gave the best performance (for me, anyway). it was taro yamamoto, boy #5 from battle royale! don't get me wrong, i like hyde, i worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit 'off', but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guy's body killing the other guys. and gackt wasn't at all that bad too, i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start. nothing much i can say about my background on lee-hom wang, i won't pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the star-studded cast. this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations i've ever heard, orenji no taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). while the complete song lasts about nine minutes, you wouldn't notice the length because you'd be enjoying hearing gackt and hyde together. anyway, this movie is a must-see not only for the fans (huge fan base~) but for those who enjoy sci-fi, futuristic movies, asian-style.

i'm a fan of both actors/singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer,i just think this is a silly one.after a long waiting time,i watched it at last and here's my comment...i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first applause goes to acting,generally that japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.yet in moonchild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it,especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for hyde part,his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.i didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel of the film is story.it has some cheesy moments but it's ok for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals.an interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of american cinema,actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew,yet original on it's own.only problem that moonchild is it's a bit slow sometimes,i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it's not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters.but all in all;this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future,and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10

this movie surprised me! not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much! the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style! normally i am very careful when this is claimed! there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action! the fact that "moon child" would feature a vampire convinced me even more! how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires! sounds promising and interesting! the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow! it takes it's time to set the mood! this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes! but "moon child" isn't an action movie! it is a drama about friendship and loyalty! the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other! the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends! the only problem i had was with the plot! a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! example:when one member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment) alexander wang sees kei (hyde) drinking blood of one of the attackers! without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends aren't together anymore! also without a proper reason given son (alexander wang) and sho (gackt) have to kill each other! i know that this is done to add some serious drama! because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced! apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie! it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! but it just is! the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere!

i am extremely picky about the films i see. i'd heard about moon child completely by accident. i've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently.i finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought.being as critical as i am about films, i will admit, the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times...but they're meant too be, as another user suggested, it's the quintessential calm before the storm, quoting gary oldman from leon...without getting into the spoilers, the film hit me extremely hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and like marriage, it's until death do you part.hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics, their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally.upon seeing the film for the first time, i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes. i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film...this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike's "audition" and "suicide club" fame?man..i just can't say enough about this film, but i'll stop here.10/10

when i first saw this movie, the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far. another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie. the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act, very anime. i think that it's a really good movie to watch. ^_^ the action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10). ^_~ if you are gackt and hyde fans, you have to see it.

many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie (gackt, hyde, and wang lee hom is very famous singer in japan). but don't judge it before you watch, is what i say. gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. it's a good film with a touchy story inside. several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. they made it so good until i can't stop watching this all over again. the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing. this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language (japan). but, it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie.i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life. when toshi was killed, when sho asked kei to turn yi-che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die, when sho's brother died, kei shoot son die, and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away~ even i told that hyde's skill is still weird but i give him two thumps up at that scene!!there's a time where the plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is sho's brother in law.whatever, i love this movie~ (very much ^^). this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.

moon child was one of the more symbolic movies i've seen. what i really liked about it was the illustration on immorality/mortality,and the obstacles and guidances through life. the movie depicts a great deal of vampire kei having the power of immorality and the advantages to it. whether if it is having supernatural abilities or everlasting life, these are what humans usually wish for. moon child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, since the feelings towards loss impacts almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and kei. the meaning of the title 'moon child' reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other people's way, giving guidance. i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on. the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic. the scene where character toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it. some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game. the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed. nevertheless, i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching. the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers. it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch.

moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise. it's easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters. the fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people, and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else i've ever heard of. it doesn't get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire, it's just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem. the way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic- there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just don't work, which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part.the other area that really stood out to me is the languages. the fictional city of mallepa contains various cultural groups, and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak. japanese gang members speak japanese to each other, but chinese when talking to characters of chinese descent. possibly the most amusing exchange involves an australian and is conducted in english. the actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others' languages, so it's quite a feat that the movie was made at all. which, i suppose, brings me to the lead actors.much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of japan's biggest rockstars, gackt and hyde, as well as taiwanese superstar lee-hom wang, whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them. in my opinion, lee-hom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character. however, any lack of acting ability on gackt's part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over-dramatic. i wasn't sure if hyde's character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across, but it doesn't really detract from the movie either way.there are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns, which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally (although this doesn't seem to stop a lot of people). i found it's best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously- it's perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends. it does have its flaws, but overall it was very enjoyable and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a few subtitles.

this movie is amazing. the plot was just...wow.i was very surprised by gackt's and hyde's performance, after growing up in the american world of the actors who can't sing and singers who can't act.in this movie, a young sho (gackt) comes across a vampire, kei (hyde). over time, they form an unlikely friendship. kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire.it's a sad movie, but not sappy. the plot was very unique, and contrary to your typical vampire flick. the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing.the only fault i would say the movie had, despite it's lack of a happy--albeit peacefulending, would be it's multiple languages. i had the unsubdued version (i'm lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese), so i would recommend getting something with subtitles.all in all, the movie was just awesome.

vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. who could ask for more? moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick! gackt is the innocent sho - who befriends a vampire kei (hyde), their relationship grows with time but as sho ages, kei's immortality breaks his heart. it doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman. the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. it's a touching story ripe with human emotions. you will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry some more. even if you are not a fan of their music, see this film. it works great as a stand alone vampire movie.9 out of 10

'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli'. such was ned's bravery.in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised. in greta he is still a hero, the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there.many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged, to the post office he held up in jerilderie. a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones' hotel, the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited.evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over victoria, in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning. none of this is wrong, and whats left out would further justify neds actions. the horse that ned 'stole' was actually stolen by wild wright (the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail). ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it.the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before. it is not self justification it is ned's biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. so go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for.

moon child is the story of two brothers and a friend trying to make it in a futuristic, economically-unstable japan. after a cunning disaster gone wrong, someone new enters young sho's life, a special friend by the name of kei. years later they have grown rather close, and have found ways to combine both their talents into one unstoppable team. during another escapade, they encounter a new friend and his mute sister who become part of their band of friends. before long disaster again strikes and the group falls apart. alliances turn to enemies and their worlds are all turned upside down. regrets and hopelessness claim some while power and success take others. tragedy claims still others. truths are revealed and lives are forever changed. and you will never see a more beautiful sunrise.this movie is a gripping tale of undying friendships, webs of relationships, and a team that not even death can keep apart for too long. moon child combines sci-fi, drama, and action with the perfect cast and talent to create the most sensationally moving movie of the time, and great for most audiences. it minimizes the everyday romances and puts more emphasis on the important values we can all relate to such as friendships, loyalty, and believing in yourself. nothing could possibly compare. i personally have never seen anything quite like it, and i don't suspect i ever will again.it appeals to the wider population in many ways and is a must see for all.

i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. i just wanted to check it out. i was not expecting much of anything. after all, a musician, an actor and a screenplay writer? not possible for so much talent to reside in one person. right?? wrong!! obsession aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects. the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along. as the credits roll by, you suddenly realize you were glued until the end.at times, the acting seems a little over the top. i do, however, believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character. otherwise, i wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed.it's worth seeing more than once. i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around.i completely recommend this movie. feel free to go in with your doubts, but i'm sure it will find a place on your shelf.

being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde, i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it. i was not disappointed. in fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations. knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors, i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances, but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on. moon child has just the right amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. i can't say that i've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde.

beautifully done. a lot of angst. friendship may not endure all, but in the end it's all that matters, or so a group of friends learn. i have watched it over and over again. the music is also amazing. when kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho, an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature. in the lawless streets of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races, and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay. a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does. i couldn't get enough of it. gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting, proving they are more than pretty boys who sing.

i voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws. other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! it's entertaining to say the least. the shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and i think gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his "matrix obsession" into it. it seems like their enemies just stands there...waiting to get shot at. however, this movie is touching and it always makes me cry. it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well. gackt is a superb actor i must say..he shows so much emotion. this was hyde's first time acting and he did okay. the role fits him. wang lee hom is absolutely great. the whole cast is what i would say, perfect for this movie. don't miss it! you'll regret it!

moon child, starring japanese rockers hyde and gackt, was a better movie then i expected. in fact, i was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies.set in mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, sho, sho's brother shinji, and toshi who rob and murder to make a living. on one of robberies, sho encounters hyde's kei vampire burning in the sunlight. through the coarse of events kei's true nature is shown, yet no one shuns him away.the time passes and implies that the immortal, never-changing kei has raised sho, and the two have a an extremely close bond. sho and kei then encounter son in an outrageous gun fight, and they become quick friends. both kei and hyde fall in love with son's sister, yi-che.time skips ahead again and shows a grown sho, this time void of kei. it also explains that sho and son have become enemies.through tragedy after tragedy this movie dives into the reality of life and all it's hardships, focusing on friendship and love. it is a truly touching movie that is sad yet beautiful at the same time.as for the acting, i think gackt did a magnificent job. hyde did an amazing job for a first timer.the shots were beautiful, but the movie did have it's rare and short gruesome shots.all in all, i must say this movie is amazing, moving, and i highly recommend it.

based on the idea from gackt, moon child took place in a poverty-stricken country called mallepa. in a futuristic timeline, the story followed the lives of the two main characters, kei (hyde) and sho (gackt) and their friends growing up together.despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous, i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship. even amongst all the hardships between each character, in the end, each of them wanted to have someone on their side, to have friends.unlike most vampire characters, kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live. a vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy, sho who's not afraid of kei. regardless of what some might've thought, i see kei as a fatherly figure to sho. kei was there throughout the earlier life of sho, he took care of him, and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives. on the other hand, sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man, he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn't all about fun and games, that death exists and able to take away his loved ones.i love the part where lee hom, the actor who played son, first appeared on the screen. the way they met up was quite cool indeed. son also has a big part within this movie, the fact that he's from a different race, a taiwanese, made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie. the way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie.i believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie. both hyde and gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters. unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs, they've done great acting jobs! moon child really made an impact for me, it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration, that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes. the movie shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad things that happen in their lives, that there's always hope. life can be cruel, that it seems hope doesn't exist anymore. it also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other, even when son became the enemy, sho did have some sort of "fun" at their last battle. every single one of them desired peace in the end, no matter how far apart they've become. the ending scene showed it to us.

i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time, so i was anticipating it greatly when it arrived. my worst fears were that it would be plodding, as well as... well, you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about? gacktnhyde=hawt yaoi love? that sort of thing? dreading it. i was very, very pleasantly surprised. the movie was surprisingly watchable, even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes, and the acting on gackt's part was quite good. hyde, being, um, hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend/gang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by. he's one of my two major beefs with the film itself. but the rest of the cast (including the child actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did- which was, mostly, get shot at and yelled at. but my second problem was very minor, having to do with the goriness. it seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over, really most sincerely dead, or lay there burbling for a rather long time. but sho just... takes the shots, repeatedly, keels over, bubbles a lot while he talks, and makes hyde cry. all in all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-film fan, it's definitely worth a watch.

this is, by all categories, the best movie i have ever seen. forget hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art! moon child's story starts with kei - a japanese vampire, who loathes what he has become and lives in denial. his wish for final death leads him to mallepa, where refugees from several asian countries live. here, he meets sho, an orphan living on the street.from here, the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie. it has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy... never has a movie touched me the way this movie do. and the actors are amazing - never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange. a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece...a last comment on this brilliant movie, is that it stars gackt (ex-vocalist of malice mizer) and hyde (vocalist of l'arc~en~ciel) in excellent roles as sho and kei. i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out.this is a must see. if you never see any films, see moon child, the crow (brandon lee) and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii - advent children. all in their original languages, of course!

this movie is really special. it's a very beautiful movie. which starts with three orphans, sho, his brother shinji and their friend toshi, they're poor children's, living on the street, but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money, and then their able to live on, to buy a house, and their life seems to become much better. they're making new friend, life-friends. but something went wrong and they're becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other.i was negative about this movie in the beginning, because when singers (gackt - solo, ex-singer in malice mizer, hyde - solo, singer in l'arc~en~ciel, both very famous in japan and wang lee-hom - taiwanese singer) trying to become actors, but this isn't like the other singers-going-actors-movies. they're doing a great job, and with no earlier experience in movies (except for lee-hom, who had been in two movies before).this is absolutely one of my favorite movies. maybe that's a little because i'm a very big fan of hyde, but - it was this movie who made me discover him.well, gackt (playing the main character - the orphan sho) was a part of the group who wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that hyde should play sho's friend, the vampire kei. at that time they didn't know each other, at least not like friends. but after the movie they became really good friend, and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation.the movie have many different feelings running trough the story, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. i think the first hour are the best, it's so beautiful. after that people are dying, kei's leaving and it all changes so much. but still it's a great movie, it's the only movie who has ever made me cry, it ends up so sad, but still beautiful.so if you haven't seen this movie, you really should. because it's wonderful, but sad. you won't regret it. ^^

the performances were superb, the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian, i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.i wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge. do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.ok, the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film. gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.see it and you will not be sorry

despite what others had said (*cough*), this is my favourite movie of all time. i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it, but once i finally did, i immediately fell in love. sure, it's strange, but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour. for those who don't know, moonchild is one of gackt and hyde's first movies. they haven't done very many at all, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. so, give them some credit. we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either. i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there, but i over look that to find the best points of this movie, the emotions displayed and whatnot. therefore, i have given, and always shall give, this movie a 10 out of 10.

i must admit - the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a *huge* fan of hyde. i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were, shall we say, pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story. i mean, the synopsis sounded really out there. and now that i have just finished watching it - i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance! hyde and gackt both gave heart-wrenching performances, and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie. you get sucked into the story, and you really feel for the characters by the end. the element of vampirism - which i love, but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with - is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic, normal to this setting, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. i ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first...and then i went back and tried to think of why i wasn't giving it that last point. came up with nothing. so a ten out of ten it is. after all - i'm not much of a critic - the fact that i'm bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it. you can tell what side i'm on with moon child.

i must admit, at first i wasn't expecting anything good, at all. i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackt's and hyde's image, but i'm glad to say it has much more to offer.yes, the acting is not that great, but it doesn't suck either, all the cast's well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters. effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough.what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline, although it merges fantastic elements, it also displays a crude reality. the developing of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that's the key of this movie. it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst.it fulfills any expectations for a good drama. i would definitely recommend it to everyone.

when i first heard about moon child, i thought it was a joke. after a few months, i figured i guess it's for real. the few reviews i read that weren't made by squealing fangirls were not very promising.when i was given the opportunity to watch it, i was fully prepared to groan, wince, and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness.i was more than a little surprised, and in a good way.yes, moon child has its moments of cheese, camp, and general dorkiness -- i think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves gackt camui, a man not known for his sanity -- but all in all, it was wholly enjoyable.no, it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very, very heartfelt, amusing, with fun choreography, a touching score, and a fun cast. i know little of japanese cinema so i can't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience, i was rather impressed.if you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, see this film. at least rent it since it's coming to region 1.on a side note, there is zero homosexual/homoerotic content in this film. i didn't even see much of a subtext. don't let people that read too much into things ruin this for you.

i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were, nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and i'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it. i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it over embellish that fact. the characters all had human traits. the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. i give this movie two thumbs so far up. definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years.

tony hawk underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster, tony hawk pro skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what neversoft and activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting.underground introduced the storymode, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony hawk pro skater fans. another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard, which is nice because now you can actually climb, run, and do all sorts of new things.the levels are good, neversoft also improved on an issue that started with pro skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs. the first two games for the ps1, n64 and dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some. pro skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits. in this version, they shortened those features, there isn't as many people wondering the streets, in fact there are almost none in some levels, and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot.this game does have one con, the storymode is a little short, of course this is neversofts first time doing this with tony hawk pro skater, so that is understandable. however, with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day.overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.

it's awesome! in story mode, your going from punk to pro. you have to complete goals that involve skating, driving, and walking. you create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team(you can pick a team to be on) and you then start your own team! there are many levels like new jersey, manhattan, and even school ii(not part of story mode though) from tony hawk's pro skater 2. you can unlock secret skaters like iron man, gene simmons, and another skater. you can create your own goals like skate letters, combo letters, tricktris, gap, and much more. you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak. if you get bored of doing that, you can do the premade goals in premade parks. the only thing i didn't like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars. 9/10.

the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. during several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.which is where this adaptation of our sunshine, a novel about the kelly legend, excels. rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. here, ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. no, i am not making that up. about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles. while the kelly gang were distinctly irish, australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some chinese migrants highlights this).heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia's most notorious outlaw. it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself. orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow, and geoffrey rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. but it is naomi watts, appearing as julia cook, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly's life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. indeed, a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.unfortunately, most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. ditto for watts, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. i can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. but that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. one scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. if one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at glenrowan. annoyingly, the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.that said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. for that reason, i rated it a seven out of ten. other critics have not been so kind, so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?), then you might be better off looking elsewhere. especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly's life.

i'm sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly. i once saw a documentary about the man, but that's the only time i once saw or heard anything about him. and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. no-one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.the movie tells the story of ned kelly's life. the irish immigrant has lived in north-west victoria all his life, but has never been very welcome by the authorities. the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family. when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes, he forms a gang with his brother and two other men. they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days. all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen, they are outlawed. finally they take over a pub in glenrowan, where they have a party with all the visitors, waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up. but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen...it's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false. i guess nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some kind of robin hood, the others will say he was an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief. i really couldn't tell you which of them is right, perhaps both are, but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same.this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors. heath ledger, orlando bloom, naomi watts, geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known, but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like. i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7.5/10

there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordan's 'ned kelly' film did. initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations, and decided to see it for myself. since then, i have acquired both the video and soundtrack, and have to say that after several viewings, i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film. it is also wonderful to see something australian! i appreciate its down to earth quality, that if you ask me is a rarity, as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films. this film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point. the cast was a bonus, including a variety of well known, and might i add, good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters. it is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines. however, if any criticism is due, it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded. in reality, these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history. for example, on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much, much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt, and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film. also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritt's efforts alone, that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery. yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. i feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. however, i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation. it certainly inspired me to look more closely. so, watch it and decide for yourself. you might not like it at all, thats your opinion, and thats fine. maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience? for me, i'd call it a breath of fresh air!

fatal error is a really cool movie! robert wagner, antonio sabato jr., janine turner, jason schombing, malcolm stewart, and david lewis are in the film. the movie's cast all acted really well. robert wagner played his role good. the relationship between saboto jr. and turner was a nice one. there maybe a big age difference there but they are a unique couple. the two actors really worked together rather well. the music in the film is really good by ron ramin and fits the flick very well. there is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie which you don't know what is going on and what is going to happen next and this movie keeps you going from beginning to end. if you like robert wagner, antonio sabato jr., and janine turner then watch this excellent movie!

i really liked this movie despite one scene that was pretty bad (the one when samantha and nick are flirting in the hotel). the story is so cool and can't wait to read the book! bravo for the super station!

the way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the x-files continues without mulder and scully, these would be a pretty good replacement duo.

the movie wasn't all that great. the book is better. but the movie wasn't all that bad either. it was interesting to say the least. the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldn't say i was actually interested in the movie itself. janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching :)they have a few cute scene's that should appeal to the romantic's. overall i'd give the movie a 7 or 8. it wasn't bad, just a little lacking plot wise.

and a made for tv movie too, this movie was good. the acting in it and the plot was just so great. this one of the only movies i've seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen. there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie, but it's very easily over looked.antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner. this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful. after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on (four times) and it too kicked was great. if you ever see this movie come on tv, i'd watch it. the effects in this movie were pretty well done, i honestly don't know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldn't suck so bad.watch it. it's really good, no really, it is!

due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was, i didn't go and see this film at the cinema. after watching it on dvd, i have to say i regret that now. i'm not saying it is brilliant, but i would venture to say that it is a good movie. i enjoyed it.people have skulls thicker than ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. i don't think ganghis kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate, and quite passionate it seems. in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, ned kelly has become a legend. legends are stories, and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger.so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang, i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. it was sentimental and romantic, but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow australians, watch 'the lighthorseman' and you will see what i mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas, such as the shooting of the troopers. ironically, i actually enjoyed the movie because of that, because it would be those details that most of the focus on ned's story would dwell. and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians.this movie was always going to have a hard time, having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to australians; perhaps a little of ned's spirit is in this movie, because i think it rebelled against people's expectations, and unfortunately missed both targets. fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned, and that is why i liked it. orlando bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf, for a change.when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one, your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime.

in this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic k-9, detective dooley [james belushi] and his dog jerry lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [christine tucci] and her partner, a mean doberman named zues who does not get along with jerry lee very well. dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. that all changes as the movie goes along. the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill dooley for the way he treated him in the past. there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. i know that that seems like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. i didn't see this movie for the jokes, i saw it for two reasons. the first reason is because i am a big james belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. james belushi is funnier than he was in k-9 and the action sequences at are better too. it would have been nice to see more characters from k-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. if you are a james belushi fan, you'll love this movie.

this film to me is a very good film!!i have a german shepherd myself and i wish to god he was like jerry lee!! i hope too that there is another k-9 in the running!! with jerry lee and dooley in them!! i don't care what any one say these two films were excellent!!

well, this is probably one of the best movies i've seen and i love it so much that i've memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when jerry lee breaks wind) and even with the script in my head i still like to watch it for jerry lee, that german shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who's smarter. the tag line holds true as well. not to mention the acting is great, though christine tucci sounds different in a whisper (check filmography under csi if you don't know what i mean). it's too bad that this movie only contained the single issue dooley and jerry lee had to work with, it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that zeus and welles had up their sleeve.

arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life far too seriously!!! watch this film for what it is, sit back, relax and have a giggle. the film does not take itself seriously, so neither should we. if you like james belushi, you will like this film. if he is not your cup of tea - give it a miss.i like james belushi, so i liked this film. so simple isn't it?? :-)

i thought it was a very funny movie. i love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good. k-9, k-911, and k-9 pi are my favorite movies. jim belushi is hysterical and jerry lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team. the only downside is that i really didn't understand how dooley's wife died. she died before this movie but how? if they said it i must have missed it. other than that i give it two thumbs/tails up! those dogs (jerry lee and zeus) must have had a lot of training. they were so funny and all the noises jerry lee would make when dooley was talking to him was so funny. my favorite was when jerry lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol

when my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for movie night, there's one movie they insist on watching over and over again: you guessed it, k-911, the third installment in the highly successful k-9 franchise starring everybody's favorite tv dad, jim belushi.folks, i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape, but a dvd?! this has been played so often that it's starting to skip; no joke! but of course you'll have that when you own a film so charming, so brilliant.of course, we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop-dog genre with turner and hooch; however, even that film doesn't measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k-9 movies.some nay-sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series. poppycock, i say. while you might suspect that a third installment - direct-to-video, at that - may not seem like something worth watching, you'd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie.i won't give away the plot, but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet - one that will have you howling with laughter! it's a shame john belushi isn't alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world.i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party. don't forget the puppy chow!

ten years after the first movie, james belushi, one of the most gifted, and over looked light comedic actors of the last twenty years, returns as detective dooley for this movie.if you are expecting more of the same from the first movie, you will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. realizing that all the dog vs. man battle of wills scenarios had probably been used up in the first movie, this one turns slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a fixation with dooley's recently deceased wife after she rejected his book, and blames dooley for her death.the script may not be the best, but the movie allows both belushi and christine tucci to show their good acting ability, while still retaining enough of the light humour of the first movie to make it work, and the chemistry between the two stars is there for all to see.an easy, light going movie, which, while maybe not worth a purchase unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or belushi, definately worth a watch when it comes on tv.

i rented this film from netflix for two reasons - i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly '50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length superman film. needless to say, after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised.an experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor. lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. a day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent. it seems that the radioactive mole men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth's core.supermen and the mole men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. released in 1951, starring a lead actor who served in world war ii, the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner, reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being 'nazis' at one point.even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, let alone the "hollow center of the earth" - which, in any case does not exist. forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book.the film is a little unevenly paced. although the molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. the script is intelligent and economical. by today's standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this film's special effects and costuming were quite good. the cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect. i was particularly impressed with reeves, jeff corey and walter reed.

i am of "the christopher reeve generation" it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and george reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top, though he just barely falls short. that doesn't stop me from enjoying this film, it has a lot going for it. it has all that a movie needs, a plot with beginning, middle, and end, plus all those parts are intelligently written. the film is edgy both in acting and storyline, something a film-noir but with tights. the story is both exciting and meaningful, this is a movie with a message that isn't too preachy. i am still amazed this was shot over 12 days, oh the glory days of hollywood, when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell... the film is polished and expertly made, directed by lee "roll'em" sholem, best known for directing with both speed and efficiency. it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down, in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight, including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from superman's point of view, also a few closeups of george in process work, and a long shot of an animated superman. this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series. a dvd worth owning in its own right, the inclusion of the film as its original whole, is icing on the cake.give blood today god bless!

my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie (passing them down in the family if you will), and i loved it.clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it's up to superman to stop this mayhem.it's just so wonderful and fun to view. the old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology. george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid, and i'm 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.

superman and the mole men is quite possibly superman's toughest adventures ever.lois lane and clark kent are sent to silsby, home of the world's deepest oil well. while there, some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town. jeff corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men. can superman change the people's ways in time to save the mole men? can superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring?in my opinion, superman and the mole men is a very intelligent, well-written and well-acted movie. even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly, it still makes a great superman adventure. a must see for anyone.10/10 stars

it must have been several years after it was released, so don't know why it was at the movies. but as a kid i enjoyed it. i just found a vhs tape of superman and the mole men at the flea market and decided to watch it again (it's been a lot of years). i wasn't expecting much, now knowing how the b movies were made at that time. but i was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding. usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired. surprisingly, the writing wasn't bad either. forget the fact that superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning, because then the story would have ended, right?! ok, the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary (they didn't even scare me as a kid). however, making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes, it was a job well done by all. i recognized the sheriff right away as the old ranger from death valley days and plenty of supporting roles in tv westerns. j. farrell macdonald played old pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than i can count. walter reed and jeff corey were familiar faces as well from other movies. did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get king kong? did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as lisbeth searcy in old yeller? some of the mole men were famous too. jerry maren has played mayor mccheese for mcdonalds, little oscar mayer, was the munchkin that handed dorothy the lollipop, was on a seifeld episode and a wealth of other work. billy curtis played an unforgettable part with clint eastwood in high plains drifter, was one of the friends met by the star in incredible shrinking man, he had a part in a movie i just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled my gal sal with rita hayworth, wizard of oz and plenty of other parts - great actor. john brambury was also a munchkin. phillis coates, who played lois lane in this movie, was without question wonderful in the part and george reeves as superman/clark kent was superman. he did a great job of playing the strong man. bottom line to all i've said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie. but it was the 50's and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space. it is definitely worth seeing, there isn't a bad actor in the group. whomever put the cast together was very, very fortunate to get so many gifted actors into a b type film. some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience - but all were gifted. so if you get a chance to see the film, forget the dopey costumes and just enjoy the excitement and acting. is it a bird? is it a plane? no, just a good, old fashioned movie to enjoy!

after being sent to prison for no less then 10 nor more then 40 years for being busted with drugs and refusing to give up her accomplishes, jackie (erica gavin of russ meyer's "vixen" and "beyond the valley of the dolls", in her last film role) has to get accustomed to life in the big 'doll' house, or at least try to, in this early film by jonathan demme. due to it's tawdry nature and sheer watchability, i would also rank this as one of his best films, right below "silence of the lambs" and "stop making sense", but so far above any of his other movies. this minor classic is just campy, sleazy, and fun enough to be an amazingly good guilty pleasure and thankfully never once goes overboard into all out parody of the women in prison genre. it almost washed out the rancid bad taste of the ludicrously preachy "philidelphia" from my mouth. however, the film is not without it's downfalls (the 'un'talent show is a huge chore to sit through and goes on far too long, barbera steele is sadly wasted, among other small things) but don't let those gripes stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie.my grade: b- dvd extras: 5 minute roger corman interview; cast & crew bios; original trailer; and trailers for "candy stripe nurses" (with nudity), "big bad mama 2", "big doll house" (with nudity), & "crazy mama" eye candy: juanita brown, cheryl "rainbeaux" smith, erica gavin, roberta collins, ella reid, lynda gold, and some others all show skin

to finally see what many consider to be the greatest women-in-prison film of all time, i felt like i had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds. boy, it sure contained the elements i expected, and delivered so much more. a constant i'm discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold, tolerance, and resolve(..not to mention sanity)being tested by their superiors. while most of them were hired for the way they look naked, because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements, something else emerges, other attributes, such as attitude and guts, that i ultimately respond to.this, as you may know all too well, was demme's debut for his mentor roger corman, and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings. for instance, there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states(..there's a particular number featuring warden barbara steele where she reminded me of alex de large of a clockwork orange).the film has female prisoners planning a daring escape, tired of the crazed antics of their wheel-chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc, randolph(warren miller). juanita brown is maggie, the tough, sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out. she's the one all the girls fear to cross. erica gavin is jacqueline wilson, the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop, unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with. roberta collins is belle, a serial kleptomaniac, best pals with pandora(ella reid). belle becomes the obsession of randolph who promises superintendent mcqueen(steele)that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies. drugging her up, randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her, whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms. cheryl rainbeaux smith is lavelle, in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a senator. lavelle receives work in randolph's office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to pandora. demme effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned break-out, using those behind the various traumas inflicted on the prisoners as hostages, with gunfire erupting.i was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time demme collaborator, cinematographer tak fujimoto, as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison, cells and rooms, not an easy task. the prison is appropriately crummy and the girls, despite being quite attractive, look the part of desperate inmates longing, yearning from the very pits of their souls, to escape such horrid entrapment. steele is superb as the warden, understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far, candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint..notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge. cale's bluesy score is incredibly depressing, while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun-and-games..i think cale's score mirrors demme's handling of the material. cale and demme's partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad, isolating, oppressive place, while, almost simultaneously, showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast. my favorite scene happens outside the prison, as two of our girls(..joining forces with a third)interrupt a bank robbery already in progress..the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob! as you might expect, you get naked women in showers, prisoner in solitary, a cat fight, shootouts, attempted escapes which go awry, and other exploitative elements(..such as a horrifying shock therapy session, not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of belle). interesting enough, demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension, understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making.

this is not my favorite wip ("women in prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in the sub-genre. it is was produced by roger corman, who at this point had already produced a few wips. it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. the movie takes place in an usa prison, not in a "banana republic" like most wip films. i'm not sure if that was a wise move, but it is an acceptable change of pace. writer-director demme really gets into his job, always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario. in fact, he is a little too ambitious for his own good. the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick. but do not worry, demme still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre. there is plenty of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. the film is a little slow, but it is very entertaining. the cast is good. roberta collins is a wip veteran, so she does not need an introduction, and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden. pam grier is sorely missed, though.

when i think 'women in prison', my mind often goes to sleazy italian/spanish productions by directors such as jess franco and bruno mattei; and while these films are often very sleazy, they're also very samey and once you've seen one; you might as well have seen them all. i have to admit that these types of films generally aren't my favourites; but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of italy and spain; and roger corman's new world pictures is responsible for some of the best of them. caged heat is the directorial debut of oscar-winning director jonathan demme, and it's a well done little flick with plenty of entertainment value! naturally, the film centres on the story of a girl who is caught committing crime and sent to a women's' prison where she is introduced to a host of violent inmates. this prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound superintendent mcqueen; and she takes offence to a play put on by the girls; leading them to plot an escape.this film is much lighter on the sleaze than i'm used to in a women in prison flick; but this is more than compensated for by some great action scenes and dialogue and that's what ensures caged heat entertains throughout. it does have to be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that came before it; but that's not such a big problem. the film never gets boring and is peppered with standout scenes; including an escape attempt while out working in a field and a bank robbery. the film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to helm the masterpiece the silence of the lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts; including best of all the legendary barbara steele in the role of the head prison warden. overall, caged heat may not leave the viewer with much to think about by the end; but it's a brilliantly entertaining little grindhouse flick and anyone that enjoys this type of film will surely want to track it down.

jonathan demme's directorial debut for roger corman's legendary exploitation outfit new world pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid. beauteous russ meyer starlet eric ("vixen," "beyond the valley of the dolls") gavin gives a robust, winning performance as a brassy, resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy, hellish penitentiary. the always fabulous barbara steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean, crippled, sexually frustrated warden (her erotic dream about doing a slow, steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly). longtime favorite 70's b-movie actress roberta ("the arousers," "unholy rollers") collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward, foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about pinnochio. lynda gold (a.k.a. crystin sinclaire of tobe hooper's "eaten alive" and curtis harrington's "ruby") makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat crazy alice. and the ever-cuddly cheryl "rainbeaux" smith does a lovely, touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from "lemora: a child's tale of the supernatural." although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language, nudity, rape and violence, it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force. demme's zesty, confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior. furthermore, both tak fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and john cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100% on the money excellent. patrick wright (sheriff mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler "track of the moonbeast") has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom. lively, rousing and immensely enjoyable, "caged heat" qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70's drive-in movie fans.

wilson (erica gavin) is nabbed by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation, marking the directing debut of jonathan demme. after writing and producing a few of mentor roger cormans' new world films, demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but has an appealing tongue-in-cheek quality to it as well; it's often as funny as it is flashy.standout scenes include a lewd and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners, as well as a potent dream / fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed superintendent mcqueen (horror icon barbara steele, doing a marvelous turn in this antagonistic role). i also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious. as in other movies of this kind, it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. these women are tough, they take no garbage from anybody, and they're more than capable of handling themselves.our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles: juanita brown as the aggressive maggie, roberta collins as the sassy belle, rainbeaux smith as the cute and timid lavelle, gavin as the wide-eyed newcomer, and lynda gold (a.k.a. crystin sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside.as our climax plays out, demme comes up with a tense "beat the clock" finish as our heroines race to save belle from being lobotomized by predatory dr. randolph (warren miller), the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women.bouncing along to john cales' flavorful score, "caged heat" is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time.8/10

when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing, you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work. undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay. speaking of gameplay, the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience. the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game. the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision. the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you.

not being a fan of first person shooters i was very hesitant to play this game. after having played the demo however i was sold. "undying" really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in. you have this green amulet,called the "gel'ziabar stone" that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at. with a special spell "the scrye" you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you. walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper:" look",with the stone glowing at for example a painting. and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting. let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell. people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats. this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around. because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark. and ghosts and monster appear at random when you don't expect them and can kill you very quickly. there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened. this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic "evil dead"! to experience something like this is a real accomplishment. there are a lot of elements that take "undying" to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced. but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws. for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge. you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hidden,secret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called "oneiros". that is all fine in the beginning. but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating. and there is no map. the game demands you memorize your surroundings. so patience is required. also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you can't progress. i don't mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures. but in first person mode that can be an annoying task. luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace. and trust me you will need it. overall "undying" is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan.

i gotta say, clive barker's undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made. i've played resident evil, silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements. barker is good at what he does, which is attach the horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at, undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title. i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud.

i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it. the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit, its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there. the sound effects and audio are amazing. there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not. you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic. the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you. if you want to get the full experience, try playing it with head phones on.

undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups. it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena. the game is set in ireland after world war one so don't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers.all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on.our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time: he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left.so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game! the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p.c..level design is also cool and atmospheric. mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress. thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first person shooter) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent. but the game has two main flaws. first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration.secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry. as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced. most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult. overall undying is a great game. definitely one of the best fps out there.

this game was really great and quite a challenge. it has a great, spooky story line and the graphics are also very good. i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish. the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me. a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans.>

cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews. as if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes.the movie is great, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent though with minimum gore, and all the way energetic to the core. loved every single bit of it. can't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off. and now the most important thing (at least to me): it is computer effects free. when i watch some hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-budgeted action "fuflo" (a russian word that means "bull*beep*"), i understand that any *beep* child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute pc effects, and stuff it into the action film. here it is different. i don't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide, who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the "chinese football" play. and it is just a little hong kong cinema made for fun, not pretending to be "star wars".having a dvd with english soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. it does not spoil the atmosphere to me.can't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play. some of you, suppose, won't like it. as to me - it's amazing. have a look at the dragon's friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head. his face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to dragon with a baby expression. and take a look at the menacing size of his mouth - it's nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces.this movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. very thankful to our russian industry for the releases of classic jackie chan movies. his modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype.total 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in its genre. thank you for attention.

this is an above average jackie chan flick, due to the fantastic finale and great humor, however other then that it's nothing special. all the characters are pretty cool, and the film is entertaining throughout, plus jackie chan is simply amazing in this!. jackie and wai-man chan had fantastic chemistry together, and are both very funny!, and i thought the main opponent looked really menacing!, however the dubbing was simply terrible!. the character development is above average for this sort of thing!, and the main fight is simply fantastic!, plus some of the bumps jackie takes in this one are harsh!. there is a lot of really silly and goofy humor in this, but it amused me, and the ending is hilarious!, plus all the characters are quite likable. it's pretty cheap looking but generally very well made, and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a jackie chan flick, it does enough to keep you watching, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when jackie (dragon) and wai-man chan(tiger), are playing around with a rifle and it goes off!. this is an above average jackie chan flick, due to the fantastic finale, and great humor, however other then that it's nothing great, still it's well worth the watch!. the direction is good. jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work, fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part. the acting is very good!. jackie chan is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious, as usual does some crazy stunts, had fantastic chemistry with wai-man chan, kicked that ass, and played this wonderful cocky character, he was amazing!, i just wished they would stop dubbing him!. (jackie rules!!!!!). wai-man chan is funny as jackie's best friend, i really liked him, he is also a very good martial artist. rest of the cast do ok i guess. overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5

this review is for the extended cut of this movie.i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago. i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea.that being said. i've always found the storyline a bit confusing. the movie is, after all, a love story. and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene.well, in the extended version this is no longer so. the old "original" version begins off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version. the opening sequence is dragon(jackie chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around.other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it. the pacing is also better and overall it just works better. it feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does.i suggest everyone who is a hong-kong cinema, or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(or at least that's how i think it was intended. why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes) when i was done watching it, i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same.

"dragonlord" sees chan returning to his role of "dragon" from "the young master". not much has carried over from the first film though. "tiger", his older brother, is nowhere to be seen; neither is the marshall, his daughter or his son played superbly by yuen biao in the original film. dragon does have the same master though - presumably all the other students have moved on to other things. (dragon's laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film, so maybe he's still studying!) originally titled "young master in love", this film sees dragon (for the first sixty minutes at least) pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways. his rival for her affection is his friend (inappropriately named "cowboy") played comically by the longtime chan stunt-team member mars. we see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire. it is one of these scenes that we (thankfully) find "dragon" in over his head.this film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office. that said, i'm sure the expectations were pretty high, and i feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on it's own merits. but even when i try to do this, i still feel that there is a problem with the film. it seems quite unfocused, sometimes rushed, and i think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as chan's other work from this period.the thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence. as in "the young master", there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action - you really feel every blow. and again, chan goes up against the same rival from "the young master" (is it the same character?), and the timing and energy here is brilliant. chan's style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his opponent - not just relying on pure physical ability - is as apparent here as anywhere else. the barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations. this is an absolute highlight of the film and one of chan's incredible career.it's not necessary to see the prequel before seeing "dragonlord", in fact, it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer. but it must be said that the original film is the superior film, and "dragonlord", with it's focus on girl-chasing and team-sports does seem baffling. luckily, the few fight scenes it offers (plus a fantastic shuttle-cock scene) push it over the line as a must-see film in this genre.

this movie is bufoonery! and i loved it! the "dragon lord" (jacky chan) and his buddy, "cowboy", totally made the movie fun, meaningful, and just plain silly. the movie is a rare blend of a good vs. evil fight and (somehow) the wonders and fun that is growing up. long shao ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", which include implementing clever, elaborate ways to escape studying (with the help of the entire household, including the tutor), competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to gain the affection of a local girl, competing in "soccer" (you will see what i mean) and the list goes on. somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people.the movie has its serious moments. but they do not depress, but rather inspire. the playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange, but is actually employed against evil. what i really loved about this movie is how it ends. not the typical confrontation (which in itself was awesome), but well, you'll see. let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie.silly, witty, meaningful, and nostalgic. great movie.

this is undeniably the scariest game i've ever played. it's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which i usually don't care much for), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround soundeffects ("scryeeee, scryeeee..") and above all incredible atmosphere. i love the scrye, which enables you, at certain places in the games, to see or hear events that happened there in the past. the only game i've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. i'm a great horror fan, escpecially of clive barker's stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1 because i'm no fps fan, and perhaps the game was a bit short?)

this film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind. first, the central father-son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong fei hung film "drunken master" (ideas from this film recur in "drunken master ii), and not "young master"; that chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly; and, indeed, the film conveys a sense of being incomplete; for instance, the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film. "young master", from the same period, also feels underdone, but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end. this film feels as though chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme, only to abandon the effort, possibly due to time and budget.or perhaps the film is simply over-ambitious. this is an important turning point film in chan's career, because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns - which is why there's such a lack of kung fu throughout the film. chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it. but both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot-twists.that leaves us with the comedy. since chan's concern is character-development, the comedy is largely character driven - as in the conflict between chan's character and his best friend, an argument over a girl. but there's plenty of slapstick as well. frankly, i find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot.this film represents an effort on chan's part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time. it doesn't quite work, and chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films, with the making of the contemporary action comedy "police story". but going back to view this film is still very informative as to how chan worked his way through the historical genre, and perhaps why he abandoned it.

the japanese "run lola run," his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone's face. fans of run lola run, tampopo, go!, and slacker will probably like this one. it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate, seemingly unrelated vignettes, all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways. catch it if you see it, otherwise wait for the rental.

japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film, chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence. as they are running, we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment. the act of running is a metaphor for these down-on-their luck people's lives. in some way, what they're really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing, but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. running makes them all feel truly alive. the big life-altering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big, violent, and so absurd that it's funny in a clever way. one of my favorite films of all time by genius director sabu.

this movie has a very simple yet clever premise - an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenience store, and the store clerk catches him in the act... the thief runs away with the store-clerk right after him. all the while, the store clerk is in trouble with a low-rank yakuza chinpira (gangster). along the chase for the thief, they catch the eye of the yakuza who's been looking for the convenience store clerk. the story then moves into high gear in the form of a tom & jerry (cat & mouse), but is added with the dog chasing after the cat. the entire 2nd act of d.a.n.g.a.n. runner (can be translate to english as "pinball runners") is about the chase, and the chase goes on & on to the point that by the end of the 2nd act, the bum forgets why he is running away, and the yakuza don't remember which of the 2 guys he is chasing, nor does he remember why they're running away from him.similar to sabu's later film postman blues, the bulk of the film is simply all chase and action, with plenty of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience engaged. what falls short is the ending, to which the chase stops when the three men run out of steam, and into one of the most chaotic mexican stand-offs you'll see on film that looks almost as if sabu was paying homage to tony scott's true romance (written by quentin tarantino).

i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster (vhs). i have to agree that it is wildly original. yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isn't one of those movies. rather, we are treated to the director's eye, his vision of what the story is about. and it does not stop. and to be honest, i didn't want it to. i do believe that sabu had to have influenced the director's of 'lock, stock & two smoking barrels' and 'run, lola, run'. but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily. i really need to see this director's other work because this film really intrigued me. if you want insight, culture, sturm und drang, go somewhere else. if you want a laugh, camera movement and criminal hilarity, look here.

a lot has already been said on this movie and i' d like to join those who praised it. it's a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. at points you just laugh out loud, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch. sabu's genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie. one is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street. this sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. it is erotic and funny at the same time. another example of sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired. first one of them, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving. all of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again. and at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing.so here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which sabu manages to show throughout the film. his characters fail (do they at the end?) but he doesn't rob them of their dignity. "monday" and "postman blues" that do justice to sabu's claim that he is a genius. go watch them!

an entertaining and substantive film, non-stop has drawn deserving comparisons with "run lola run". the film quickly develops into a chase sequence, during which the viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydream sequences. the chase serves not as as a fast-paced climax, but as a journey that makes up the majority of the film. during the "run" we see the characters grow and momentarily forget about their dreary lives, about the "macho" roles they've bought into, and eventually forgetting about why they started running in the first place. much like fighting provided a "clarity" for the characters in "fight club," running provides this film's characters with a means to step away from the false values that we all allow society to create for us. their running serves as way to truly taste life from an unclouded perspective, and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process.my appreciation and enjoyment only wavered slightly in the ending of the film, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to revert to acting out those false macho roles i thought they had escaped from through their journey.still, the only true problem with this film is that it wasn't distributed outside japan sooner.

this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them. it's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. as in sabu's subsequent movies (i didn't see "unlucky monkey" yet, but the other ones are as great) failure, chance and humanism play great roles. the cutting and montage is inventive and artistic, without the movie being an "art" picture, but a highly entertaining one. when comparing it to "run, lola, run" you have to keep in mind that "dangan ranna" was made some years before and was shown on german tv as early as 1997...so it's more probable that it served as inspiration for tom tykwer's movie, and not the other way around. complementary to the other reviews i have to add that i like the acting and the ending very much. this movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.

what would happened when a depressed cop works with a shrink on probation? may be a lot of fun... this movie set a benchmark in the action/comedy genre of the argentinean cinema. dearable characters, probable story and a pace that between laughs has some thrill. i recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining. peretti and luque join their efforts to fight against a cold and daringly foe in a time when it's difficult to trust someone. this movie will surprise you, the other side of the coin of "analyze me", but not alike, with nothing to envy. and if you like to know bs.as there where few scenes of downtown and the city center.

very intelligent humor excellent performing i can't believe how people could think it deserves a 1/10! i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity, watch it... don't miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing "happy birthday" and "el payaso plinplin" (an argentinian song for kids (i think... it could also be south american, i'm not sure)). this two songs that have the same melody... but people don't usually realize that... it's just grate! i tried to write this in both spanish and english, because it's an argentinian movie... but the page wouldn't allow me :( hope you enjoy it!

should this be an american movie i'd rate it 7: we've seen this before. being this an argentinean movie, and being myself argentine, i'd like to give it a 10, since it's the kind of quality i'd been hoping -rather than expecting- for. it's superb quality is astonishing, given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd world...i can't forget the scene when díaz forces silverstein's fiancé to confess -you know what i mean if you saw the movie. i think that's the key moment of the movie, not surprising maybe, yet original. that's when the real action begins.before watching a movie i always try to gather some previous information. being this a mainstream, satyric, commercial one, i press "play" and make a suspension of reality and logic, i'd say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this. it's impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, yet it's believable in a certain way. as for me, i couldn't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary -"sos malo" ("you're mean")... put in the mouth of díaz, the greatest one.i'm rather tired of seeing movies "designed for" peretti. i know he's a superb actor, but sometimes i feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest, luis luque's role in this case. i'm not very fond of argentine television, so i haven't seen much work from luque, but it's pretty obvious that he's an excellent performer. his physical role, his stares, his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance. i think his role should need some upgrading, just to let him show us how great he can be!i don't know whether szifrón is planning to make a sequel or not. i know he won't make it if it's to follow the rule that "second parts were never good", so if he makes it, i'll surely go see it. and i hope that, in the future, takes into account the possibility to give peretti's counterparts the same chances to develop their roles.great movie, great performances, and lots of laughs!

tiempo de valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre, but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting, tremendous rapport between its leads, and outstanding photography. diego peretti stars as dr. silverstein, a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz (luis luque), who's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy. diaz has been suspended from duty, but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated. silverstein and diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own. peretti and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer, though peretti isn't as classically handsome as hill. remarkably, even at almost two hours in length tiempo de valientes doesn't wear out its welcome, and indeed writer-director damian szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film's charming coda. all in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence.

i sit through movies like "tiempo de valientes" and i want to talk about cinema for hours. the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation, because i'm watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for film-making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifron's mind.looking the environment, so uncompromised, so simple, i'm thinking; this man is a genius. no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed, and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors haven't still achieved. "el fondo del mar" is the name and, it awakened (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema.starting his journey from people's daily real lives, szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in "el bonaerense"; the federal police department's life. trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences, not into the places he saw. yes, there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations, but szifron in "in there", his is more of a detective story, like the ones we know and love, with the mysteries and the thrilling music.but there's a lot of humanity in his writing, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, alfredo díaz and mariano silverstein. there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors are the ones the film can't do without. the first character (luis luque) is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him; and has to work on a case.the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective. he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins díaz in his routines: "it's nothing, the usual stuff; no problem". but it is bigger than that, and it will unfold a part of the doctor's personality he didn't know.the relationship developed between the two leads can't be explained unless it is observed, because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying, today, to leave a signature in our history. reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity, during a high pressure situation, díaz tells silverstein: "how do we continue our treatment?", and silverstein answers: "no, i'm not your doctor. you call me to have dinner; i'm your friend": we laugh because we can't help it.and we can't help laughing when díaz crashes a car in the street and doesn't gives importance to it, or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street, or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein can't believe it (but then smokes it too because he's screwed up); or when silverstein tries to be friendly with díaz's robber friends. magic from diego peretti is what we receive there. he, a psychiatrist himself, gives a performance in plan "locas de amor", but impresses with all his range. luis luque on the other hand, is back on track with a top-notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is.there's a passion i have for this, and as i said, i could write about it for hours, but unfortunately that's not the way it works and i have to be precise and summarize. although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them, i could assure that "tiempo de valientes" is the comedy argentina had been waiting for and never gotuntil now.

tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy.after his great fist movie called el fondo del mar and the spectacular tv pro-gramme los simuladores,damian szifron made another great work.tiempo de valientes looks,for moments,a movie made in hollywood.diego peretti and luis luque are two great actors and here,they have great performances.the movie is very fun and funny and it has superb moments.tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy that i totally recommend if you wanna have a great time.and i have to congrats szifron for all the talent he has.rating:9

this movie is damian szifrón's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in "el fondo del mar". with "tiempo de valientes" he creates extremely well done characters, far away from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. i've seen szifron's talent to present every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them. his control over them is magnificent, so he restores on the movie a great direction and an overall brilliantly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on screen.the spanish takes over the english, the buenos aires urban landscape at night replaces hollywood sets and the premise is just as interesting as any other, so we have a film daring to compete over hollywood's machinery.but i want you to see the movie mainly because i've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. it seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. i really believe with a film making like this argentina is really up to the competition.

this is a very funny movie, easy to watch, that entertains you almost all the time. the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon, but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort. the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz (played by luque) on his assignments while he also assist him (diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him). some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide: understandable and laughable anywhere. is very good overall, it would deserved an 8, but i rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end. on a personal remark i must add that is a "bravo" for argentinian filmmakers, considering the little good is coming lately.

a hilarious action comedy in which damian szifron takes into the lives of díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. he is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. and silberman, a jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. he is told to accompany díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. soon the situation reverts when silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. a nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.

this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry. this movie will also tell you why indian movie-goers are astute buyers.amitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one-time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again. prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it. zanzeer saw the making of angry young man. lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master-servant loyalties. but then, the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero. amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks, thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent. to me, this alone is the biggest pull in the movie. the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing.amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies. thanks to manmohan desai. this movie had a good dose of them. the shoe caper in the party, the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazare's considerations, the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fare.shashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody, finicky character (remember him asking ranjeet to "shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cake incident"). his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant. but prakash mehra knew the indian mind...and so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie. it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. but this is a caper, remember? and as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy. the end is always predictable, and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol, the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well.so what is it that makes this movie a near classic? amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi. prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story. chuck the story, the characters and the plot. my marks are for amitabh alone.

for anyone who may not know what a one-actor movie was like, this is the best example. this plot is ridiculous, and really makes no sense. it's full of cliched situations, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy... you name it!but amitabh bachchan can make anything convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception. everyone turns in a decent performance - shashi kapoor, waheeda rehman, ranjit, om prakash, smita patil... but it is the megastar who overshadows everyone with his towering presence. without him, this movie would have been a non-starter... the story is about separation / mistaken identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs evil - everything, really! amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all counts, in an otherwise silly film! and did i mention that it is ridiculously funny?

this is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. amitabh as a country bumpkin, arjun singh, is hilarious. the best thing is the laughter never stops. the plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. there are villains (ranjit) and there are brothers (sashi kapoor) and there are vixens (parveen babhi) and there are lovers (smita patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. but this movie is about amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious. later in the movie he turns into the angry young man he is famous for but the humour stays. memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.all in all i was rolling with laughter throughout the movie. if you want 3 hours of entertainment with amitabh at his absolute best - this is it. it will easily give it a 10/10.

by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet. the movie never, and i do mean never, lets up in action. it may be mild action but it's action. once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. the explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were feasible, and the fighting was incredible. matt damon will forever be jason bourne.all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception. the action, the stakes, the plot. how they do it i will never know. i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies. because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie, we wouldn't have this one to talk about.so don't go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you!

last christmas, i was lucky enough to receive one of the 1200 ultimate bourne boxed sets from my better half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday. given how many recent trilogies have stumbled over the finishing line instead of striding triumphantly through it, i was somewhat wary of approaching "the bourne ultimatum" but i really shouldn't have been worried. the electric actions sequences and bruising fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story-lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers i can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series.jason bourne (matt damon) returns after an apparent leak about operation blackbriar - a new program based on the old treadstone project - to the journalist simon ross (paddy considine) at the guardian. determined to uncover more about his half-remembered past, bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the cia including deputy director noah vosen (david strathairn) believe that bourne himself is the leak and start to pursue the rogue agent with renewed vigour. can bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good? personally, i felt slightly disappointed with "the bourne supremacy" as it ditched the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film. not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic "bourne identity", it seemed more like a slow-burning spy novel rather than an action-thriller. no such worries here - every car crash, punch, kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully, it still retains a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around. it also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films, providing a suitable bookend to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed. performances throughout are nearly faultless - even julia styles begins to offer something more than book-wormy eye-candy. the only real downer is that this, like the other bourne films, has little to do with the original novel but unless you're a die-hard ludlum fan, this isn't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre.nothing pleases me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears, "the bourne ultimtum" is a cracking movie filled with enough bone-crunching action to satisfy the meat-heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute. even at the final reel, you're never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not (and if not, what more do you want?), this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can. no wonder this series forced the producers of the bond movies to throw out forty-odd years of movie history in order to start again. bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent bond films look more like austin powers in comparison until "casino royale" gave the bond series the reboot it desperately needed. missing out of the jason bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition - go and get yourself a copy of the dvd. not the ultimate bourne collection though - limited edition, i'm afraid!

i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow! i had already seen the first two films and i liked them, but ultimatum, i loved.matt damon plays jason bourne, a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run, trying to discover who he is.like i already said, i loved this movie from start to finish, no plot holes, slow scenes, everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films, but in all senses it was much better.best stunts, car chases, actors, and effects i've seen in an action movie all summer, (surprisingly due to spider-man 3, pirates, etc.) but i it wasn't just action in this film, jason doesn't just kill and run. he has a soul and the audience feels for him, so drama is included. but that doesn't slow it down.of all the "threequels" that came out last summer, this was the best.

"perhaps we can arrange a meet. " "where are you now? " "i'm sitting in my office. " "i doubt that. " "why would you doubt that? " "if you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face. "bourne remains street tough, and elusive. only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy. conversation is macho, to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour. its all about the action.the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well. a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to great effect. there is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.if the shaky cam doesn't annoy you too much, enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going.

this movie was excellent. i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did. like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced, realistic and intense. if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also. the movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic. ok, julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far-fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in "treadstone" that bourne knows, that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction. the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them. the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them. they never treat the audience like idiots.all the actors were solid in their performances. i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen reprising her role from supremacy, david strathairn and scott glenn. i recommend this film and the trilogy. i do miss franka potente though.

the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy jason bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is "universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.first, i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to ultimatum. there may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like i was. you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy. jason bourne is played very well by mattdamon. damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.i won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. however, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3. it's the best action movie i've seen since live free or die hard.good) damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie bad) story is like many others

having not seen the films before (and not being able to stand matt damon), i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies. however, i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable. fast fight scenes, crazy motorbike chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in tbu. the near-misses between the cia and bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained.nevertheless, several things really grated my cheese.firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of bourne, cia, bourne, cia, bourne, cia. this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia, i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne. he crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something! very unrealistic.and secondly (inevitably) - the shaky camera. it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. we were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. fair enough if greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation, but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently!but all in all tbu is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. but i didn't think it was the best film of the year, despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.8/10.

picking up right after the moscow-showdown of supremacy, this is bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax. throughout the tight, 115-min-runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid, paris, marocco and ultimately new york. damon is every inch of the hard-trained killer robert ludlum imagined, he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now, and it's the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable, and it's exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar-opposites of himself that's so breathtaking. in this third, bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it, ultimatum delivers such an high-octane performance that you'll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull-offs; just look out for two great car-chases and a fight-scene as realistic as bond vs. shaw back in '63. director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get; a true pay-off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy-thriller standard.

this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization. in reality, perhaps they are. after all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne.matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. he is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. he gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.there is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less hollywood than many pictures. these sequences add realism to the film in feeling.the suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off. this is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & i am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.

the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. it is a political film more than a plain entertainment. jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed some one who became his corpse. but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people. who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980, when he became vice president? that goes along with what is being said on the internet. then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation. a woman and the senate; read my lips. in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the cinema. right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate. so go and watch the film. it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for, but no one is able to pretend it won't come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

the third and last part of the bourne trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.the director and star (damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. how they got around that? the action scenes, for once, but they did another thing too, which i can't reveal, because that would be a spoiler. but if you watch the movie, than you'll notice it! funnily enough i read, that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)

he now has a name, an identity, some memories and a a lost girlfriend. all he wanted was to disappear, but still, they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built. now he wants some explanation, and to get ride of the people how made him what he is. yeah, jason bourne is back, and this time, he 's here with a vengeance.ok, this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world, but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. of course, like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's, "the bourne suprematy" is a super-heroes story. jason bourne is a captain-america project-like, who's gone completely wrong. in the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one. he now fights against what he considers like evil, after a person close to him has been killed (his girlfriend in "suprematy") by them. that's all a part of the super-hero story, including a character with (realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible) super powers.and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world (there's no frontiers in the bourne's movies, characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of "24", an american enemy, who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him. funny how "mad patriots" are now the n.1 enemies of paranoiac hollywood's stories.beside all those interesting thematics, the movie isn't flawless : the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes. but all that doesn't really matter, for "the bourne ultimatum" is an action movie. and the action scenes are rather impressive.everyone here is talking about the "waterloo scene" and the "tanger pursuit" and everyone's right. i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger, that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark. visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on american's contemporary thematics : "the bourne ultimatum" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick.

i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater. i'd been waiting for this since before they started filming. i wasn't disappointed.minor spoilers below- overall it was good, but it also lacked the continuity of the first two. identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama. this movie felt choppy at times. the plot-building down-times were slightly too drawn out. that caused the following action to feel too frenetic.camera: speaking of frenetic, the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me. i know its has been talked/whined about to nausea on the message board, but it doesn't mean it's not relevant. all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted. the ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie. it is a cheap, student director trick to make the film feel unsettled. i'd expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids, but not in this classy, adult, action series. too much extreme close-up also. do some framing. get some interesting shots. constant close-up feels like lazy directing to me.story: the story was very confusing at first. they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go. gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know you've missed some crucial information. felt rushed or compressed for time reasons. after you catch up however the story is quite good. it's enjoyable following leads along with bourne. however, i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy (landy/bourne on the phone) being in the middle of ultimatum thing. it basically makes the movie a half-prequel. i thought that was awkward.cast/characters: the star of the movie is the action. obviously there are only two originals left. bourne and nicky parsons. them teaming up was kind of odd to me. i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and confide in. unless i completely missed something, they never even tell you why they teamed up. the other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet. this felt like gilroy/greengrass/whoever wanting to not leave open ends. understandable but disappointing. seriously, damon with clive owen in identity and marton csokas in supremacy.. those scenes were phenomenal. these assassins are as uninteresting as castel (the first fella bourne fights in identity). the cast in general has degraded as the the series went on. clive owen was practically an afterthought. that's a measure of strength for that first cast. the second, they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen.... not exactly equal. this one trades brian cox and franka potente for 3 actors to be named later. nothing against david strathairn, scott glenn, or albert finney, but they're not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series. aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long, the acting was right on.as a whole, it was successful. felt like they wanted to get the series over with though. if they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts, eliminated scott glenn's part entirely, zoomed out, and taken the camera away from the seizure victim, it would have been perfect.ending spoileri don't see why they leave bourne alive at the end. it was my understanding this was the conclusion. they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless. i thought that was going to be it. a full circle type of ending. i did like nicky reacting to the news report though.spoiler specifics warning - quote from movie below -bourne's last line at the end "look at this.. look at what they make you give." quoting the first assassin he killed, i loved that. the final scene was great. (except that it was vosen {strathairn} that shot at bourne. why would he do that? just out for vengeance? if he was angry enough to murder, why not shoot pamela landy after she faxes his top secret file? that didn't make sense.)

the bourne ultimatum - jason bourne (matt damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia's latest program "blackbriar" to make super assassins like himself.i was so psyched for this one that i watched it's predecessors yesterday and today. identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops, slight lacking in action and suspense.hoo boy, does ultimatum have suspense! even when you know bourne will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it. it's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those $150 million giant robots did in transformers.chalk it up to paul greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy, as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring, with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (i'll never look at those the same way again) and an electric fan (don't ask). the music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over.the acting is good, and the evolution of julia stiles' character "nicky" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. this longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in supremacy, but just works better in ultimatum (better script). i am reminded of a scene in "goldeneye" (the only good pierce brosnan bond film) in which sean bean's character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed. bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources. albeit, resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything.sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia, interpol, and the police nearly anywhere he goes, that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports. sunglasses maybe? if you have a pulse and love action movies, than bourne ultimatum is for you. hell, it's probably the best action film to come out this year. of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. it kind of drags a touch near the end, but i almost feel tempted to overlook that. this is the first "3" movie this summer to at least match, if not exceed, the original and that is saying something.a-

im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you. this movie is awesome. from beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. the fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it. damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. he is this role. a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne. this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad. excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.p.s. the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action, but i still think we could do without it. the good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action.

first and foremost, speaking as no fan of the genre, "the bourne ultimatum" is a breathtaking, virtuoso, superb action movie.secondly, it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super-hero stuff.thirdly, the film carries a complex, important point, about crime-fighters turning into criminals themselves. no reference is made to abu ghraib or the executive branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights, none is necessary.so, the latest in the "bourne" series, in the hands of paul greengrass (of the 2004 "bourne supremacy" and last year's "united 93"), is a significant achievement, perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre."breathtaking" above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer seemingly holds his breath, pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless, globe-trotting, utterly suspenseful action. there is no letup, no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes.oliver wood's in-your-face cinematography is making the best of tony gilroy's screenplay from robert ludlum's 1990 novel (which doesn't stack up well against the "bourne identity," written a decade earlier).matt damon is once again the inevitable, irreplaceable bourne, the deadliest of fantasy cia agents, this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity, his past, and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine. nothing like his quietly heroic edward r. murrow, the always-marvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official, pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal "take-no-prisoners" policies and brutal procedures.joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairn's bad one. and, there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bourne's aid; a combination of greengrass' direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character, her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue.so good is "the bourne ultimatum" that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit, this time stretched to ridiculous excesses, as bourne defies constraints of geography, time, gravity... and physics in general. (can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? why not - it looks great.) all this "real-world" magic - leaping from country to country in seconds, to arrive at some unknown location exactly as, when, and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities. and yet, only a clueless pedant would allow "facts" interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the bourne fantasy.

the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. it goes further to play the anti-bond theme. bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.the film starts out in a flurry as bourne is running from the moscow police. the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. or does it? the time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things. a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. they aren't his target. from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, noah vosen, who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs. pamela landy is back as well as nicky parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well.the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney. it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.

i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy. please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. just leave it alone. right..moving on.as talented and versatile as matt damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne.if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. it sticks to what works and adds a little more. i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'identity' and 'supremacy' all mesh in 'ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of jason bourne's troubled past. the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more exciting for me.if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first. this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world. this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. i'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think 'ultimatum' might, just might, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.

having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies, i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatum.however it was a very thrilling experience and i didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the interval! i don't think i have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film. since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne. i've heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.the stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. well done.

"the bourne ultimatum" begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as jason bourne (matt damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the cia black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. a devastatingly icy david strathairn as the "man behind the curtain" is added to the returning cast of regulars including joan allen (excellent) and julia stiles (non-existent).like the second entry in the series, i wished paul greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. however, that being said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but i'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there.with the absence of the emotive and involving franka potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the "identity" and the "supremacy", this "ultimatum" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about bourne's past. it's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.

paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last! i've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project. all i have to say to that is...are you kidding me? come on it was not that bad at all. i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. as for the rest of the movie i really didn't even notice it.you can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne. sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. he really becomes jason bourne in this installment. damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen, ezra kramer, and julia stiles. david strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret cia organization.even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. this film stands far above the other two bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!

when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i didn't think much of it. at the time i was eleven years old, so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers. over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing, many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies. until two months ago i couldn't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum, i really had no intentions of watching it. but then i decided to go back and re-watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions. so i went out and bought both the original movies. and what a surprise it was to me when i was gripped by them. identity i found the superior of the two, but supremacy isn't far behind. they're both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them. because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum. and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint! matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies, i'd seen him in the talented mr ripley, but i never thought much of him in general. however, it appears he was born to play bourne (pardon the pun). throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see matt damon at his very best, even better than he was in the departed and i thought he was one of the best things in the departed. you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable. the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding. joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy, here she excels herself. her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie. julia stiles turns up again as nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character. julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets. david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen, he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. he's definitely the nastiest character we've met, and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty. strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, i will not say anything about the character, that's best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline. this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie. as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts. that very final scene in supremacy, in new york, a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time. won't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum. unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences. this is the part where i should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline, but i'd be lying if i didn't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases. the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time. well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series. in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in moscow. so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups, all very violent and shockingly brutal. a bike chase that is absolutely amazing, many foot chases which are even more amazing, a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable, and oh so much more! but the highlight for me has to be the scene in waterloo station, won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped.so any flaws for the movie? in my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you. the movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top. the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that. while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal.

i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me. most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window. with that said, the bourne series has been fantastic. doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly. this is not the sci-fi absurdity that was bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less). there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out. with director paul greengrass taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair. the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment, the bourne ultimatum. in what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy, the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.once again, bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses. someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story, he is assumed to be the mole. only pamela landy, she who was on the case to find him in supremacy, knows that he can't be the one. bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace. it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them. what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer. the film, then, becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends, or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series, with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story, it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression. this is not a detriment at all, however, as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot. admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight, between bourne and the cia's second asset, alone. the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own, but when they finally meet up, we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see. also, rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films, we instead get around three small scale road races, just as intense, but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.after five years of waiting, we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling. by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him. no one could have done it better than matt damon. he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences, but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him. joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job, but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox's character, from the first two films, took matters into his own hands. needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from david strathairn. like cox, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision. with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country, you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing. even the little guys do a wonderful job, like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything, albert finney as a man from bourne's past and possibly key to his origin, and edgar ramirez as one of the cia's operatives sent to take bourne out. ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen (identity), karl urban, and martin csokas (supremacy). he doesn't talk much, if at all, but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino.in the end, one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them. his skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott, but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts. rather than feel like over- production, his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action. let's also credit cinematographer oliver wood, who shot all three bourne films. he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them.

this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've given any movie. what made this movie so good for me? constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. finally, i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).i liked the first two bourne movies, but i loved this one.warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!

jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done. meanwhile, a cia chief in nyc outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.this shot effectively captures the mood of the film. as well as portraying bourne's quest to find out how he became jason bourne, ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.it is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. it's just so intense. bourne says to simon ross (considine) "this isn't some newspaper story, this is real" and in the audience you almost believe him. the camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. the action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing.the pacing is just incredible. it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. while they're often simple (the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it.with its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. ultimatum is its peak.

the bourne ultimatum (2007) review: after a thrilling set of two, we get the final installment. here's my take:the bourne ultimatum has it all. we have jason bourne(matt damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything. he has been running for too long. this time, it ends.the bourne ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer. matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date. he has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense. the reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way) or cheering on. (or both) i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping. the audience was loving it.the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package. all of the goods and then some. this is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.the last word: excellent conclusion. the best of the trilogy. this is how summer movie thrillers should be done. i love the bourne trilogy.

i don't hand out ten star ratings easily. a movie really has to impress me, and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that. furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.from the moment that the opening title appeared, i knew we were in for a ride. paul greengrass has done it again. everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. however for me, that last one was never a problem. i think it adds to the suspense.i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd, simply because it is genius. it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and altogether, an unforgettable trilogy.

i loved this movie. i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series. i found it very heart warming to see adam west, burt ward, frank gorshin, and julie newmar all back together once again. anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the batcave. you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film, especially adam west. and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so. i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it... now they wished they had. i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs. now this movie will join my collection. thank you for the reunion adam and burt.

corny! i love it! corny - just as the tv show was about 40 years ago! adam and burt rekindle the same on-screen chemistry that never seems to have left! they re-live old memories, plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behind-the-scenes things which are quite interesting to know. 1960s tv was corny escapism for so many of us back then, and this dvd is no exception, if you are familiar with the original tv show. the fight scene with the written boofs and bams or whatever is fantastic!! the movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away. at the end frank gorshin makes an appearance. he passed away not too long after this dvd was made, i believe, so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to adam and burt, just as he did to batman & robin so many years ago. he didn't lose his touch! thanks to julie newmar to re-living a villain role, also. in conclusion i think that this dvd is for great memories, and i wish to thank both adam and burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original-!!! thanks, guys!!!

this is one of the best reunion specials ever, with adam west and burt ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it. it's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail, particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960's era, the batcave set, wayne manor, the costumes, and the actors selected to play the younger versions of west, ward, burgess meredith, cesar romero, and frank gorshin! this 90 minutes is well worth your time, and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's "batman" television series. i note that clips from "batman" were from the movie, and not the series itself, probably because of legal restrictions. let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on dvd.

i'm a belgian and grew up in the sixties. most of the us series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and batman was one of the first i was keen on. unfortunately over here it caused a "panic hysteria" amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent. geez, compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays. so because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them !) to compensate. i even got the view master slides... i had an urge to see the caped crusader. all kids need some kind of hero.years later i finally got the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously. the tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when i would've watched it as a kid, but i understood it at the age of 17. yeah, i've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on dvd (to my knowledge)this evening i enjoyed "return to the bat cave"... it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. they play themselves as they played their parts in the series.congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "feast"... i'm gonna watch it again. my advice to all batman fans is: see it !!! rent it !!! lend it from a friend !!! buy it !!! i'd never expect myself to rate this as 9/10... very well done !

i really enjoyed this. i got it thinking it was going to be a documentary, but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek fun.i think this has been well done, pretty much an extended tv show into a film, but due to the characters or rather original actors willingness to have fun and be made fun off helps this work in a great old style innocent way.if you are a fan of the original tv series then i am sure you will enjoy this.q

i watched this last night with low expectations. the reasons being, i don't usually like "made for tv" movies and rarely have i liked "cast reunion" movies. but, the critic in the los angeles times seemed to like this, so i gave it a chance. i'm glad i did. it was pretty good. adam west and burt ward reunite as themselves. but, in a way, they were acting as their "batman and robin" selves. they were being campy and not taking themselves, or this movie too seriously. the movie starts out with them searching for the "george barris" designed batmobile, that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan's home. while, they are searching for the car, they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together. this is told in flashback. it was well done. the actors that they got, for the younger burt ward and adam west were dead on. and, for a tv movie, it got down to the nitty-gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen. i give this one a 9/10, i liked it that much.

extremely well-conceived - part whatever happened to, part behind the scenes revisitation, part reunion film - all done in the same campy style that made the original series so much fun. i only wish this had been done 10 years ago to include more guest villains who have passed on.

this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history. unlike the brady's and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt , but also get to see them back in action. filled with kapow's and catwomen and the riddler(s), batman is back ina well told , tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series , but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that haven't been heard in 35 years.kudos!!!

i loved this movie. i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series. i found it very heart warming to see adam west, burt ward, frank gorshin, and julie newmar all back together once again. anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the batcave. you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film, especially adam west. and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so. i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it... now they wished they had. i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs. now this movie will join my collection. thank you for the reunion adam and burt.

a strangely enjoyable effort, combining an appropriately far-fetched plot involving adam and burt and flashbacks to the original tv series. most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from burt ward's book "boy wonder: my life in tights" and i imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie. like the book, it left fans of the original series hungering for more. if you missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it. i'm making a copy for my kids right now.

this was basically an attempt to do the same thing with "batman" that was done with "gilligan's island" in "surviving gilligan's island." for those of you who missed it (and shame!) "surviving gilligan's island" (full title: "surviving gilligan's island: the incredibly true story of the longest three hour tour in history") was a special from a few years back, where bob denver ("gilligan"), dawn wells ("mary ann") and russell johnson ("the professor") related the story of the show's creation, cancellation, rediscovery & rebirth. along the way, stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew. it was very well done. it was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show."return to the batcave: the misadventures of adam and burt" is in a similar style. the re-telling of the history of the show, the re-enactments, the general feel are all the same. what's missing is the straightforward approach that "surviving" took.in "return", adam west and burt ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited. after being allowed to stay, adam and burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show: the legendary batmobile! adam and burt decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show. this eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the batmobile and why.choosing to use this conceit (actually having a plot) is the biggest letdown of this show. unlike "surviving", "return" forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline (the theft of the batmobile) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in (the history of the show.) it is the historical sections that work the best. the casting (as in "surviving") is excellent. jack brewer ("adam west") and jason marsden ("burt ward") capture the feel of the actors without looking *too* much like them. brett rickaby ("frank gorshin") bears a stronger resemblance to his subject, but captures none of the late gorshin's charm, only his characterizations. other actors' portrayals are short and functional, with none standing out as especially good or bad. many of the stories have been told before, but they mostly play out amusingly, with only the occasional clunky presentation. another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of lyle waggoner's tryout for the part of batman. the only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story. this downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly.the "main plot" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. this is not really a fault in and of itself, but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall. strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot (especially in these kinds of things) but we really get neither, here. the performances by west and ward seem somewhat flat (even for them); the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural. again, i think the comparison to "surviving gilligan's island" can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback. in "surviving", that's all it intends to be. in "return" it tries to do double duty and, unfortunately, often fails. gorshin and newmar do well (although i agree with others that gorshin had not aged well and that newmar had - and what's waggoner taking to look that good?) but aren't given enough to do. again, i think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here.another odd point about "return". this special is about the "batman" tv series and its history, yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie. even the waggoner footage is technically movie footage. if you know you're "bat-history", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the tv show when cbs needed to fill time fast. so when waggoner and west were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the tv show. why "return" only uses movie footage is unclear. it most probably has to do with rights issues, but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know: seeing julie newmar in the present, but only footage of lee meriwether as catwoman in the past.overall, i liked the show, mainly for the flashbacks. i would have preferred the style used in "surviving gilligan's island", but i can understand why they'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter. besides, i like these people. it's nice to see them out and about, still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history. i just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there.

yes, i did, as i sit here red-faced, remembering having felt almost guilty as i watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential (in comparison) as "mommie dearest."how does one explain the appeal of "batman and robin" - i mean the only ones who ever really counted, adam west and burt ward. it was a terrible show, with terrible plots and terrible acting - and, oh yes, it was terribly funny! and the same applies to this "reunion" and "flashback" movie. adam and burt are invited to an auction where the old batmobile is going to be sold off for charity. but it gets stolen, and our pals (as themselves) jump into their old characters' personas (if not their costumes) and head off to find out what's happened. along the way they reminisce about the series, and we see how it all came together in flashbacks, with jack brewer and jason marsden playing the young adam and burt of the tv series. it really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series, and adam and burt just stepped perfectly back into character (even though they weren't really in character - well, you'd have to watch it to see what i mean.) it was also great to see julie newmar and frank gorshin.if you're not a fan of the old series, you'll hate this. if - heaven forbid - you actually thought michael keaton and george clooney made acceptable "batmans" then you'll hate this even more. but if you grew up with adam and burt and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode - well, this one's for you.yes, it's true - 9/10

there are many kinds of reunion shows. one kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they haven't played for twenty or thirty years. these have mixed results. `return to mayberry', despite some silliness, was okay; `return to green acres' as execrable (eddie albert used a word for the script i won't repeat here, but both it and the movie stink); `rescue from gilligan's island' filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways, though the show itself was silly even from a `gilligan's island' viewpoint. in most cases, the scripts are weak; sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it's nearly always fatal for the characters to know they're being funny. new characters are introduced who don't fit the mix. in the main, these reunion shows are pretty weak. a second sort of `reunion' show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around, telling stories, reminiscing, interspersed with flashbacks from the shows. then there are movies based on the shows, which are rarely good; and movies based on the history of the show (`the brady bunch' has had both of these happen to it, with various results).`return to the batcave' uses nearly all the above, with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint, which makes it the best of the reunion shows, and has raised the bar for the others.adam west and burt ward and summoned to a showing of the original batmobile. while they are there, the car is stolen. the adam west of the movie is a man demented. he called jerry, his butler, `alfred'. he opens a bust of shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage. he's obsessed with being a crime fighter, when in fact he's merely a washed up actor. when the batmobile is stolen he not only believes it's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it, he drags and unwilling burt ward in as his assistant.the pursuit is largely loquacious, with west and ward reminiscing about the old days. it is broken by `flashbacks' with actors playing west and ward in the old days. the modern scenes and the `flashbacks' both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained. there are also running gags that show west is able to make fun of himself: in ward's book about his time on the show, he spoke frankly about west's libido and also his being a skinflint (west makes ward pay for everything in their pursuit, down to tips and bus fare). the clues they follow, the characters they meet (even in flashback) all fit the mentality of the old series, and there are several homages, including a fist fight with written sound effects.the whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache. there are also cameos by julie newmar (looking like she's had one facelift too many) and frank gorshin, reminding us why he has such a cult following. gorshin will be the riddler when jim carey, his obvious successor, is long forgotten. the movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax.this show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately, there are few that can fit the pattern. this show had actors replaying their old characters; young actors playing a movie about the making of the show; the actors west and ward reminiscing; and a modern-day movie with the real adam west playing the demented adam west. it has everything. if you loved the old show, this is the stopper on the bottle.

i can't understand why many imdb users don't like this movie. why they think it's sooooo bad etc. it's not worse than anything else out there. personally i think "soldier" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre.reasons why i liked "soldier": kurt russel, connie nielsen, jason scott lee, the script (david webb peoples), great visual effects, and the directing (paul anderson).i even think that this is the best work i've seen from director paul anderson, who has previously directed the entertaining "mortal kombat" and the not so entertaining "event horizon".

i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies. kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays. but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie. oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie. if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel. i give soldier *** 1/2 out of *****

i loved this movie and will watch it again. original twist to plot of man vs man vs self. i think this is kurt russell's best movie. his eyes conveyed more than most actors words. perhaps there's hope for mankind in spite of government intervention?

i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video. i am a big nut for sci-fi action flicks though anyway.without giving any of the story away, it is worth seeing if you like sci-fi without requiring much thought. the story is basic, and the plot is very good. worth your time to see!maybe they will make a sequel? :)8 out of 10

i really liked this movie. kurt manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves. he doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action. he is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny.

of course, by any normal standard of film criticism, soldier is a very poor film indeed. kurt russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a gladiators contest without the crash mats.abandoned on a junk planet, he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. kurt doesn't talk much. finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. kurt gets angry and kills everyone. a planet gets totalled. the end.unless the academy start a new category for "best explosion", soldier is not going to win any awards. however, as ludicrous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience. the military hardware is the coolest since aliens (the apc's especially) and, at 90 minutes long, it doesn't outstay its welcome. please note that the below mark is only a guide. knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns.7 out of 10

i have to say i quite enjoyed soldier. russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity. very watchable and nowhere near as bad as i'd been led to believe. yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment.

interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to. however, i'll try. this was a very good action film with some great set pieces. you'll note i specified the genre. i didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation, and i didn't berate the acting. enjoy if for what it is people, a well above average action film. i could go on but i've made my comment.

soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be. i found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in paul verhoven's starship troopers. the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere.one particular trivia-bit stands out for me - todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate. for the oblivious ones out there, tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty's elegiac last lines in blade runner. to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least. maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic?i'll give this one 3 out of 5.

this movie is ok if you like mindless action ,corny acting, and a very small plot !the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of"event horizon". the costumes are like something from a mad max movie .none of the soldiers talk ,so others tell them what to do.it eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place. i personally liked russell better in "tango and cash""escape from la/new york" and "executive decision". it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie!!

i've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit--which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing.first of all, this movie attempts "serious" science-fiction, social commentary, more than action-adventure. there is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. if you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad "aliens" clone. but, again, that's not what it's about.the movie is really about todd's (kurt russell) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly *back*). but because it's not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer, kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. and he really does a wonderful job--it can take two viewings to appreciate it.the surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.

what a perfect example of "less is more..." kurt russell (sgt. todd) only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words. what a challenge! like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotive gesture, all combines to make a stronger impact. this is one of those top 5 movies i can't live without, right up there with the classics like road warrior. if you liked this, check out "mad max 2, the road warrior" and "braveheart" both starring mel gibson. also "gladiator" with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also. the "thirteenth warrior" starring antonio banderas and "blade runner" starring harrison ford.

i fell in love with this silent action drama. kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well. raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, todd (kurt russell) is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers.the stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born - soldier. not rambo, not schwarzenegger, not bruce willis, not mel gibson, not jason statham - kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his - original, daring, and all too human. i miss the fact that sequels were never made.10/10-ld_________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this was excellent. touching, action-packed, and perfect for kurt russel. i loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. this movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend. i cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. the ending wasn't twisty, but it was still excellent. if you like escape from new york, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you. not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect. something for everyone.

stoic and laconic soldier sergeant todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant colonel mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by jason isaacs), who has todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants. todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. director paul w.s. anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by david webb peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. moreover, anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. bang-up supporting turns by jason scott lee as brutish rival soldier caine 607, connie nielson as the compassionate sandra, sean pertwee as the kindly mace, jared and taylor thorne as mute little boy nathan, gary busey as crusty seasoned veteran captain church, michael chiklis as the jolly johnny pig, and brenda wehle as the sensible mayor hawkins. better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might. david tattersall's polished cinematography, joel mcneely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing.

kurt russell is so believable and the action so non-stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest-to-goodness important themes [overcoming fear of the stranger, learning to rise above early conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the storyline. this is so very rare for a 'guy's action flick' that even i [who thinks most a/a is violent pap] liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i know.....it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action-adventure box office hits -- it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non-stop action moments. i'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it. anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi-layered, multi-themed beauty or not care about it. this film could convert anyone who avoids a/a as mindless violence. if a guy takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a cable listing] to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks.

nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russell's career.i have my reasons.firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of russell's interpretation of todd, the eponymous soldier. i'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting i've seen russell pull off. todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.the portrayal is spot on. todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. he suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. his hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood. many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.todd's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. fear and discipline we are told. always. fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsen's sandra - but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - fear and discipline indeed.then there is the subtext of his abandonment (twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in our world, in his it can only be worse. russell quickly picks up the mantle of mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death.then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between busey's church and the hotshot from hq, mekum. mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. any one of them could pound todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them. an incentivized todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance. it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.there are many other subtle themes. when a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you.

this is a great movie. it has a captivating story, an awesome main character, very good acting and killer action. this takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.the story is very well done and there are no holes. kurt russell is a solider named todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives. eventually the military introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. jason scott lee being one of them. as a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like todd. they test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle russell is injured and assumed to be dead. the military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that russell is alive.todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on. for a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. he rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people. when they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.just as russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. what the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like todd and the other old soldiers. so while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than todd, todd easily outsmarts them. the military starts realizing this and todd kills all of their men but one. that one is jason scott lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between russell and scott lee. russell obviously comes out on top.this is one of the best action films i've ever seen and i've seen a lot. this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines. the writer also didn't forget that russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women "sir". there are no holes in this film, every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining.an awesome one man army action film for fans of rambo, commando and missing in action. this is highly recommended for all kurt russell fans and action/sci-fi fans.

soldier may not have academy acting or lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me. i won't tell you what its about, i'm sure you already read the summary. this is a great doomed futureistic action/science fiction movie. kurt russell doesn't say much, he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character. there are great action and fight scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but thats hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives. i have not seen soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites. i'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy/sci-fi movies.

in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, breed to be expendable warriors. but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is, " you should have made them smart as well as fast". kurt russell did a incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined. even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when he is given a hug, and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself, and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier.

the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the -thematic- conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between todd and his bio-engineered replacement. both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.peoples' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half-way through the movie, which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp.nonetheless, kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little.not a great film, but one worth seeing.

ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence. you can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot. kurt russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding. recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!

i watched this movie expecting what i got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. what really surprised me was that kurt russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue, and because you are playing a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! howzat? kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. in spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, russell pulls off an incredible characterization. his robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints. great job!as usual, jason isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. connie nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous. i'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eyes off her. unfortunately, gary busey's role was too small and limited. much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling, i don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. by the end of the story the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. yes!the sort of feeb who thinks that russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point.

when i rented this movie to watch it, i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie. instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating. and you know what it worked. kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was. i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film.

i don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here. i only saw it when it came onto cable. the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was.i'm certainly happy it was'nt - kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. the scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner, alien, silent running, logan's run or thx1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest i've seen to it in a long time.he changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack arnie one liners, he does'nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending.that's why this film did'nt do well. it did'nt follow formula, and among a 18-25 year old target american audience, that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.fear and discipline.always.

kurt russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action-thriller from paul anderson (event horizon, resident evil.) set on a garbage-dump planet, soldier plays like a cross between rambo and shane, with russell barely speaking as the title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for dead. the supporting cast of colonists, including connie nielsen, sean pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute michael chiklis, is able. they spend most of the movie being scared of russell, and the rest of it running for their lives. russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. with almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances. it is almost a mime performance. when the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass--and does so in a strong, silent, matter-of fact way. there are flaws. jason scott lee is brutish as a "superior" genetic soldier. jason isaacs does a great impression of frank burns from m*a*s*h as a weaselly commanding officer, and gary busey busts a gut (and nearly busts his girdle) as todd's mentor. this is an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of blade runner--david webb peoples wrote both screenplays.

david webb peoples meets paul anderson...if it already sounds weird to you, then you are right, because it is.peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc... he covered these issues in bladerunner, unforgiven, and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines.paul anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. not surprisingly so have all of his other movies! and here is a violent thriller with moral implications!peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie. soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill, and never had a normal life. they are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead. there he must cope with a group of refugees, some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. but then......the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. big, violent, loud action ensues and peoples' script turns into an anderson action-fest. it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the end product is better then i expected. entertaining, somewhat, though admittedly not very, thought-provoking, and exciting once the action starts. 7/10rated r: a lot of violence

in a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. they are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. this is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `soldier,' directed by paul anderson and starring kurt russell. the scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. russell is sergeant todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. but even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when todd and his peers are no longer the elite. a new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and todd's generation is suddenly obsolete. what follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: fear and discipline. russell gives a commanding performance as todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. he has few lines in this movie, but russell speaks volumes with his eyes. this role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before. and he's given todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. notable performances are also turned in here by connie nielsen (sandra) and jason isaacs (colonel mekum). rounding out the supporting cast are jason scott lee, memorable as caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; sean pertwee (mace); gary busey (captain church); michael chiklis (jimmy pig); and mark bringleson (rubrick). anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. it's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference. much like `1984,' and `mad max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of universe in which we all must live together and share. i rate this one 7/10.

ok, so soldier isn't deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable.the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnie's in the t films (and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).so to the film itself, a reasonable us/brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not. the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe escape from la - sequels are such fickle creatures!). sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci-fi lineage. and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance. i don't think you will be disappointed.

soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons. but i liked soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me.first, the art direction is tight and well executed. as far as science fiction backdrops go, soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre. the sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; i didn't love all of their future military style, but i was impressed with the effort. for me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.second, i'm a kurt russell fan. i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films. soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero. it's not an award winning role, but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog.third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. this isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.if you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice. just don't expect the next bladerunner.

why do i like disorganized crime so much? why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie? it's kind of hard to explain, but i'll give it a try. first of all, it's very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of "official" reviews want you to believe. but then again, that depends entirely on your sense of humour, so there is no sense in arguing about that. often the humour is in the dialogue, and often it is situational comedy. there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck. when the farmer drops them, they just stand there by the road, covered all over with cow s*** or whatever. they are totally unnerved; then, realizing the humour of the scene, they one by one start laughing about themselves, and ruben blades (as carlos), looking (and certainly smelling) terrible, nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath (simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again!). which leads to the second point: the acting. fred gwynne, lou diamond phillips, william russ, ruben blades and corbin bernsen (okay, the latter overdoes it a bit at times) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact, you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film. thirdly, there is the plot . jim kouf, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves. more often than not, there is no real action, and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss (bernsen) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually, grudgingly, like each other. the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences, yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details. incidentally, the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across, because it per-fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way. therefore, take my advice: watch this film, but if you don't chuckle, grin or smile during the first 10 minutes, forget it - it's not your type of film. ps. the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me.

i found this film by mistake many years ago & wondered then (still do) why it didn't get the acclaim it should have. well written, beautiful acting, one ironic twist after another, and there is plausibility in what the nefarious characters are attempting. i would not recommend this film for people with short attention spans; it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend that there maybe a kernel of truth in this story.

action. comedy. suspense. this movie has it all.the plot goes that 4 would be professional thieves are invited to take part in a heist in a small town in montana. every type of crime movie archetype character is here. frank, the master mind. carlos, the weapons expert. max, the explosives expert. nick, the safe cracker and ray, the car man. unfortunately for frank, he is apprehended by 2 bumbling detectives ( portrayed very well by ed o'niel and daniel roebuck ) that have been chasing him from new jersey write after he sends out the letters to the other 4.our 4 characters meet up at the train station and from the beginning none of them like or trust one another. added to the mix is the fact that frank is gone and they are not sure why they have called together.now frank is being taken back to new jersey by the 2 detectives but soon escapes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who are having all sorts of problems of their own.truly a great film loaded with laughs and great acting. just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different

i saw this movie with my dad. i must have been pretty young, around 15. it was on star movies one afternoon.the movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. it really caught pace after the first half hour.all the actors are great, especially blades and lou diamond. i guess it's the ensemble, they just play so well together. i can watch this film anytime.i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious.a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.

remember the early days of pay per view? i do, and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t.v. as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it. and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap. well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv. and i remember almost every scene that was in the add. i've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them. it's one that when its on its hard to shut off. all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right. there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category. it has enough action and laughs to sustain it. check it out if you dare!

i couldn't agree more with nomad 7's and i a hvr's comments. a perfect laid back sunday morning movie. the humor is subtle (exact opposite of "slapstick" as one misguided commenter noted).but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over. i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previews(hbo maybe?). had never heard of it previously. don't know why it wasn't marketed that well. ?? when dvd's were released en mass, it was one of the first movies i replaced. a great combination of cast and writing. plus, the back drop of montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either (beautiful).it's probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is? if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea. this movie needs your full attention. the humor is mostly in the dialog.i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th. but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off, i'm going to loose it (ed o'neill's face is priceless!). recommended 110%.

i like this film for several reasons. i have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like topkapi. i also enjoy films (like topkapi and big deal on madonna street) that spoof the the genre. one of the best ones is disorganized crime.corbin bernsen has met four cons over the years, and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small montana town. but he hasn't given any details on the crime to the fellows, nor do they really know each other at all. shortly after he sends for them bernsen is arrested by two new jersey policemen (ed o'neill and daniel roebuck) whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back. while he is in their custody the four cons (fred gwynne, lou diamond philips, ruben blades, and will russ) show up without a clue about why they are there except that bernsen was planning something. the first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other, with gwynne and philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other. at the same time we see bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from o'neill and roebuck again - not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed. the result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film: the four cons trying to figure out what bernsen's scheme was, and how to put it into operation, and bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin (and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of). there is also a third, smaller, plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local sheriff hoyt axton against the idiots from new jersey who keep getting into his hair.there are many delightful moments in the film, such as axton, egged on by o'neil and roebuck, into surrounding a house in the town that bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of, and yelling (through a megaphone, "come out, we have you surrounded!!", only to have the scene switch to a huge, montana plain that bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment. there are moments of misadventures by our four cons, who fortunately put the oldest (gwynne) into leadership position. this does not always guarantee anything. at one point their car won't start, and they have to thumb a ride by truck. unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure.the conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery, including disabling all the police cars at the critical time (philips specialty is cars) is also a gem of timing, suspense, and comic results. the film is very entertaining, and certainly worth watching.

i first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and i could not stop laughing. everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. as far as film is concerned i wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic. it gets it's meaning across. the cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. corben berbson, fred gwynne, ruben blades, and ed o'neil are hilarious. for this who haven't seen it, i will give you a brief synopsis: four criminals meet up in a small town in montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. however when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from new jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. the film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of oceans eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in montana rather than las vegas. all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie.

i don't know why i like this movie so well, but i never get tired of watching it.

the plot is tight. the acting is flawless. the directing, script, scenery, casting are all well done. i watch this movie frequently, though i don't know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me. see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much.

corbin bernsen's sent letters to four criminal associates he's worked with in the past and it's a real intergenerational mix with fred gwynne, lou diamond phillips, william russ, and ruben blades. they're to meet him in this obscure montana town and he doesn't explain why because he's then picked up by out of state police from new jersey on a warrant. of the criminal group that's been gathered together, they all know bernsen, but don't know each other. a lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out. as the oldest gwynne though denying it kind of takes charge with the others grumbling, but going along. especially when they figure out what bernsen had in mind.as for bernsen, he's got the good fortune to be picked up by a pair of bumblers in ed o'neill and daniel roebuck. he gets the drop on o'neill and escapes.after that it's the four criminals trying to finish what bernsen started and bernsen getting away the police. in the intricately plotted screenplay, it's fascinating how both story lines keep intertwining with each other. hoyt axton as the local sheriff watches in amazement at what unfolds in his town.disorganized crime is a fabulously funny caper film by a bunch of players who seem mostly to have had a background in television or would soon. i can't say that anyone stood out in the cast they also seem to click so well together. ironically none of these people are comedians per se, but they all exhibit a light comic touch that good directing brought out. disorganized crime is one very funny caper movie, the kind of film that well known pessimist mr. murphy would have written.

another one for the babes & bullets crowd. the story is much edgier than any other musical i have seen: cannons hidden up the missing legs of females, and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale. more effective than contemporary 'drama.' it is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants -- in lue of leggage. pretty remarkable if you consider the context.despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90% of the surprises, this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon/rocket-launcher (hence no group shower scenes or thongs) the hidden projectile-launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back, seemingly from nowhere, in miike's dead or alive (1999), the torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original tomie (2000), or the harrowing flame-thrower scene in sunny gets blue (1992), all testify to an almost third-world cantinflas-esquire influence in the contemporary japanese cinema, of which i am at a loss to explain, but cannot complain.you won't see good quality movies of this essence made in hollywood, its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill, is all but laughable. this is a true film and while its great in its entirety, the ending is a brilliant, if not unblatant rip-off of certain sergio leon pictures, involving cannons where legs should be, and certainly is appropriate!

yet another remake of "fistful of dollars", sergio leone's remake of kurosawa's "yojimbo" (suggested by the novel 'red harvest').this one is strictly a b-movie; taken as that, it is rather enjoyable. the direction is crisp, the acting full of verve, the limitations of its 'direct-to-video' photography well-handled.the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the 'fistful'/'yojimbo' plot to a sub-plot from leone's 'once upon a time in the west'. although leone directed both 'fistful' and 'west', his motivations behind the two films couldn't be anymore different. the 'man with no name' (eastwood) is a borderline socio-path with a soft spot for broken families. harmonica (chaeles bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family, and obsessed with revenge. these two characters would not have had much to do with each other. in order to bring them together, 'gun crazy' has to twist it's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we're actually following.but this is a b-movie after all, and filled with action and silliness; it's entertaining on that level, just don't expect anything more.

the story of "a woman from nowhere" is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a eastwood spaghetti western: a mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place. even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel: sergio leone and ennio morricone would be proud. the really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) woman, saki (ryoko yonekura) on a harley, and the location is in a town somewhere in japan.in this actioner, there's a considerable amount of gunplay, some of it good, some predictable, and other spots somewhat hokey, but it's a whole lot of fun. ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due. it wasn't much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge, but she handled things very well. she shows her acting skills much more as otsu in the nhk drama, "musashi."i'd highly recommend film if you're a ryoko yonekura fan (which i adoringly am) and/or a "girls with guns" movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings. to me, there's something eminently and inexplicably appealing about "girls with guns" movies like "la femme nikita" and "the long kiss goodnight." and to have a gorgeous gal like ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake.

having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical, there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script, and in some cases don't seem to care.well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release, it is good. the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry. i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role, ok he's not oscar material yet, but he'll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here. dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie.ultimately, just give it a go. you won't be disappointed, you won't be bored, in fact, i think you'll be more than happy with the end result.

first of all, this film was not released to theatres (tested poorly they say),i say they figured the story of crooked cops, politicians & dedicated newspaper people had been done to death,just send it dvd & cable tv> & take the money & run.that being said i usually like this type of movie, especially with this named cast. morgan freeman, justin timberlake, kevin spacey,l.l.cool j, cary elways, john heard & on the distaff side, piper perabo & roslyn sanchez.the plot & story have been done to death, but the above cast brings life to this violent movie & it is actually watchable.justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by morgan freeman, the others are either crooked cops,& politicians or somewhat decent guys, the 2 ladies are the girl friends of ll cool j & justin timberlake & do whats required, it is quite violent, many killings etc, not for children. by no means is the a great film, but for what it is & the cast it is definitely good,ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) imdb 8 (out of 10)

i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first. it wouldn't have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money. the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world. justin timberlake did a good job. i wasn't expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job. considering it is his first movie he did a good job. this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night. it should go pretty well. the cast was great. so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out!

though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors, special effects that are excellent, and a story line that is full of surprises, it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to dvd. perhaps it contains too much 'anti-police force' information, or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut, but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to dvd allows us to enjoy it.the theme is old: rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt - in this case the f.r.a.t. (first response assault and tactical) team, a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of edison from its low point of crime, drugs, prostitution etc. working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now, 15 years after its formation, frat is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people etc. the lead dog is lazerov (dylan mcdermott, who makes a terrifyingly real gangster!) and his partner rafe deed (ll cool j, even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor). reporter pollack (justin timberlake) catches wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper's boss ashford (the always reliably fine morgan freeman). gradually polack convinces ashford and subsequently wallace (kevin spacey, also a consistently fine character actor) and they aid pollack in this investigative reporting. the closer pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results.timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead, especially in the company of such seasoned actors. but ll cool j, freeman, spacey, and mcdermott keep the well-oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end. no, it is not a great movie, but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message. grady harp

first off, i'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan, but i did like this movie.i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about. i didn't find justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. the story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but i found it well done. l l cool j's character was clearly conflicted, but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. morgan freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as i love kevin spacey, he was kind of just there. his character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's kevin spacey, he can do no wrong.surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that. every shooting had a point, it wasn't clichéd, pretty solid really.overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen. i would say it's worth seeing.

this wrestlemania just didn't do it for me. while some things, such as the battle royal and involvement of celebrities were a throwback to the good old days, so to speak, it seemed to be more of a highbrow "in your house" than anything else. above average...worth it for several matches such as the tag team title match, although worthy of note is that the title change meant nothing, as it was reversed the next night.

any true wrestling fan would have to consider this wrestlemania to be one of, if not the best of all time. it was packed with excitement and surprises. one of the greatest matches of all time was between shawn michaels and steve austin with special guest ref mike tyson. the show that michaels put on was unbelievable, especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match.

wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemania's but i would personally put it, in my top 5, if not the top 3. it has so many great things, and it truly signified the birth of the attitude era, which was wwe's best era, in my opinion. hbk has the heart of a lion, and him putting over austin like he did, on his way out, was pure class on his part. it has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see, and it has j.r and the king at their announcing best!. matches.15  team battle royal loud pop for l.o.d's return. i'm not a fan of battle royal's, and this is yet another average one. very predictable, even when you 1st see it, it's obvious l.o.d would win. looking at sunny for 8 or so minutes though, definitely helps. 2/5wwf light heavyweight championshiptaka michinoku|c| vs aguila.taka gets a surprising pop, with his entrance. fast, high-flying, and very exciting. if these two had more time, they would have surely tore the roof off, with their stuff. taka wins with the michinoku driver.3 1/2 /5wwf european championship.triple h|c| vs owen hart stipulation here, is chyna is handcuffed to slaughter. nice pop for owen, mixed reaction for trips. a really, really underrated match, that ranks among one of my favorites for wrestlemania, actually. the two mixed together very well, and owen can go with anybody. trips wins, with chyna interference.4/5mixed tag match. marc mero&sable vs goldust&luna. defining pop for sable, unheard of that time, for woman. sable actually looks hot, and the crowd is just eating her up!. constant sable chants, and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring. not bad for a mixed tag match, it had entertaining antics, and passed the time well. sable's team wins, when sable hits the tko.2 1/2 /5wwf intercontinental championship. ken shamrock vs the rock|c|. before i review the match, i'd like to note the rock showed off his immense potential, with his interview with jennifer flowers, before his match. nice pop for shamrock, big time heat for the rock. too disappointingly short, and i thought the ending was kinda stupid, though shamrock's snapping antics were awesome to see, and the crowd went nuts for it. rock keeps the title, when the ref reverses the decision.2/5dumpster match, for the wwf tag team championshipcatcus jack&terry funk vs the new age outlaws. the outlaws are not as over, as they were gonna be at this time. crowd is actually somewhat dead for this, but i thought it had some great hardcore bits, with some sick looking bumps. cactus and terry win the titles in the end.3/5the undertaker vs kane. big time ovation, for the undertaker. much better than there outing at wrestlemania 20, and for a big man vs big man match, this was really good. it was a great all out brawl, with the undertaker taking a sick looking bump, through the table. wwe was smart, by making kane looking strong, even through defeat. after 2 tombstone kick out's, taker finally puts him away, with a 3rd one.3 1/2 /5wwf championship. special guest enforcer "mike tyson"hbk|c| vs steve austin. big heat for tyson. crowd goes ape sh*t for austin, definitely one of the biggest pops i have heard. mixed reaction, for hbk. this is truly a special match up, one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history, you can tell when j.r is even out of breath. hbk gives it his all, in what was supposed to be his last match, and austin has rarely been better. the animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing, and it's as exciting as it gets. austin wins with the stunner, with tyson joining 3:16 by knocking out michaels. austin's celebratory victory, is a wonder to behold, with one of the nosiest crowd's you will ever see, king said it right, they were going nuts.5/5bottom line. wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real. it has everything you want in a wrestlemania, and truly kick started the attitude era. this is very special to me, because it was the 1st wrestlemania i ever saw, back in 98. "the austin era, has begun!"9 1/2 /10

wwe was in need of a saviour as wrestlemania 14 rolled around. the departure of bret hart and subsequent evaporation of the hart foundation had left the vile d-generation x stable unchallenged in the wwe. their despicable leader shawn michaels had stolen the title from hart thanks to the interference of vince mcmahon and, with help from his cohorts triple h and chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy. but at the royal rumble a new contender had emerged. stone cold steve austin. hated by mcmahonagement, austin had dx worried. so worried in fact that they'd enlisted the help of "the baddest man on the planet" mike tyson as a special enforcer. austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with shawn michaels.but first, there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the legion of doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle royal to become no.1 contenders for the tag titles. i'd actually forgotten this match existed until i rewatched the ppv. no very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time.next match saw the light heavyweight title defended by champion taka michonoku against aguila. the wwe had established the light heavyweight title to compete with the strong cruiserweight division in wcw. it was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at wrestlemania. short match, going about five minutes, and in fact too short for much to be achieved. what little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw taka retaining his title.ok, our next match saw dx member triple h defending the wwe european title, which he'd won in farcical fashion from shawn michaels on raw in december and hadn't defended on ppv, against owen hart, the sole survivor. triple h got a big entrance with the dx band there to perform his theme song. chyna accompanied triple h to ringside, but was then handcuffed to wwe commissioner sgt slaughter. triple h and owen have a nice little match, before chyna interfered causing a low blow on hart which leads to triple h retaining the title. good match, could have been great had it gone slightly longer.but of course we wouldn't want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife marc mero and sable defeat goldust and luna vachon in the first mixed tag match at wrestlemania in 8 years. and, in all honesty, it wasn't worth the wait. while not terrible, the match was in no way memorable either. this was the nearing the end of mero's only run in the wwe and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with sable.next up we saw ken shamrock flip out and cost himself the intercontinental championship as he destroyed ic champion the rock, but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold, resulting in the referee reversing his decision. this was a short match, but decent for what it was.next saw the first good match of the night as wwe tag team champions the new age outlaws lost their titles to cactus jack and chainsaw charlie in a fun dumpster match. the decision was overturned the following night as cactus and chainsaw had thrown the outlaws into a dumpster backstage, rather than the one being used in the match, but this was still a fun match.now it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between kane and his brother the undertaker. kane had cost undertaker the wwe championship at the royal rumble and then "killed" him when he helped shawn michaels lock undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before. this was a decent match and told a nice story as the underataker absorbed everything kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match.this left only the main event which saw wwe champion face steve austin with mike tyson as the guest enforcer. michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the undertaker at the royal rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations. triple h and chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside. the match ended with austin ducking an attempt at sweet chin music and hitting the stone cold stunner with the ref down. tyson then came into the ring to count the three, celebrating the win with austin and then knocking out michaels after the match. it turned out tyson and austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along.that was the final ppv match for shawn michaels for four and a half years. it helped establish austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by tyson's appearance proved a crucial turning point in the wwe's battle with wcw. austin would go on to become the biggest star in wwe history, and along with the rock, mick foley, the undertaker and triple h lead the wwe through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance. and it all started here at wrestlemania 14.

i love this movie. it was one of my favorite movies. the action never stops. the whole movie was done very well. the ending is really good. ontop of it being action filled, they even have a surprised put in there for you. when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie, but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance. i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie. it was very original. whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me. the acting was great. luke perry did an excellent job once again. i give this movie the highest rating.

this movie was pretty good. the acting was great, and there were some really great actors in it like, buchholz and roger moore. this film is full of surprises. confusing at times...yes, but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense. the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars.

the cast is excellent, the acting good, the plot interesting, the evolvement full of suspense...but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely 80 minutes long. if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots, it would have a much better effect. another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one.

not as bad a film as i thought it would be.it has a good cast.nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors.would like to see more of olivia d`abo in future projects.maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy maryam d`abo.also a good use of unseen locations such as luxembourg.hopefully we will see more uk-european co-productions like this.

** warning - contains spoilers! **first of all, i would like to say that i really liked this game. i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents. i am glad that i did that.first off, i would like to say that the single player was very good. the first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you are at a party in london, and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. of course you have to rescue her, and it is quite a big level, but should probably take you at least five minutes. the best part, and i think also the funniest part, is when you are in the jet-pack, and people are rappelling down big ben. just equip the jet-pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down. pure fun!the rest of the levels are very good, but pretty short. there are four mini-levels you can unlock, and that is one of the let downs, because only the first two of them are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives, i mean, c'mon! we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad!the multi player, me and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games! you can be a load of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character.gameplay - 8.5/10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphic, but that isn't extremely often). multiplayer - 10/10 (needs no comment, just great, you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles). sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10 (the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1).i give this game: 8.5/10could have a bit of improvement, but it's still good.

ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world. the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional. i got this game april 2007 (two years after release), and i am still impressed with the gameplay. it's a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games.i give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over. the only thing i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level, it was too much pressure. on the whole i like the game a lot!!

this james bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite james bond game so far because: the missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good. the cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play. the voice over actors are really good and it is cool that sean connery does the voice for james bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like sean connery when he played james bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie. the graphics a pretty good in this james bond game. also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool.overall score ********** out of **********

the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy: step into the shoes of agent 007. "frwl" comes closer to this goal than any other game, because this time you control the real james bond. no offense to pierce brosnan, who made a fantastic bond and loaned his voice and likeness to "eon", but sean connery was the original james bond, and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool.i must say at this point, like many others who have reviewed this game, that sean 70 year old voice doesn't fit his 30 year old image on screen, and this takes some getting used to, but it's certainly worth it. he makes lines like "bond james bond" and "shaken, not stirred" into a big deal again. but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as octopus is, as bond said in "octopussy", "only the tip of the tentacle." the awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel. it's the original gun barrel from the movies. then you take on first mission, rescuing the prime minister's hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at parliament, and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro. the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond, right down to the classic rock-n-roll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game, as bond infiltrates a secret factory.after the game's opening, the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie "frwl." james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a lektor device from a russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him. in turkey, bond teams up with lovable sidekick kerim bey. bond must retrieve the device, protect the damsel in distress, and get both safely back to london. bond screenwriter bruce feirstein worked on the script, and he's done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie. the characters from the movie are all recreated well, but some are better than others. the impersonators voicing villains rosa klebb and red grant are uncanny. and there's a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss moneypenny, m, and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery 007 movies.what puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games, besides sir sean's voice and likeness, is two notable features in the game play. one is bond focus. while you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other, an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at, such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death. the other notable feature is the stealth and mêlée kills. when you're in close enough range, just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean connery's james bond displayed.sean connery's bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent, so you only have a few gadgets, but they're good ones. the q-copter is a remote control helicopter that can self-destruct and explore areas bond can't reach, like the q-spider in "eon", only better. the classic laser watch is useful, not just for getting into sealed rooms, but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available. sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with, but you must experience them for yourself. besides the gadgets, you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game, including the gray suit from the movie, the standard black tuxedo, a retro stealth suit, and that classic white tuxedo, all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies. when you drive in the game, you drive the aston martin db5 straight out of "goldfinger." it can't turn invisible, but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie. and when you're not flying down the streets of istanbul in the "goldinger" car, you can fly through the air in the "thunderball" jet pack.then there's the multi-player. of course, it has to be compared to the standard of the "goldeneye" game, and it fails. also, you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game. but the multi-player is amusing, and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing. the basic game does have other flaws. some of the movie's most exciting moments, particularly the gypsy camp shootout, bond's brawl with red grant on the orient express, and a confrontation between bond and rosa klebb's bladed shoe, aren't done justice in game form. and the game is a fast play, even on the hardest difficulty. but overall, this game is the best james bond experience so far.

good: engaging cinematic firefights, great presentation, vehicles are actually fun to drive, fairly appealing multiplayer, faithful to the movie, and the list goes on.bad: main missions are a bit short.this game defines what a "good" third person shooter(not necessarily a spy-game) is. great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission through, and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer. the hype this game had, was lived up to, and i personally think you should buy it, and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one. loads of fun. the sound in this game, is a rip-roaring achievement from a few previous bond games, and firing a weapon, really feels like you're firing a weapon. it ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy.all in all, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through, and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty james bond "nightfire" game for gamecube.

i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. i am glad i did. it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game. i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie/game remake. the bonus levels were very hard! the sniper one i think was too hard, it made me so frustrated i didn't play the game for a week and a half. there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. the only thing i might change was the upgrade system. i didn't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. i really liked the q copter. i think the developers did a good job.

i, like many horror fans, have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years. here, at last, is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes.you want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood, lots of it, by the bucket load - you got it.with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham, this really is fantastic stuff.despite it's low budget, by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix, director james eaves has created something that feels much bigger.a must for old school horror fans.

turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. the variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! i enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. i also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts, hellbreeder and sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. they have a great website which is worth checking out. can't wait for bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.

the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast, and excellent direction by james eves. the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast. james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action, fall and then rise to a climax. he does this with an element of humour, plenty of twists, thrills and blood. this is a return of the old vampire movie, with loads of gore, blood and screams. the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure,but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action.great !

"pandora's clock" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film. this movie, which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in 1996, is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease. the u.s. government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (richard dean anderson) and a virus expert (daphne zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster. i'm not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries, but i liked "pandora's clock". it's one heck of a thrill ride. jane leeves (tv's "frasier"), robert loggia, and edward herrmann (as the president) also star.*** (out of four)

i've seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student, the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out. this one, however, was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end. having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a-b that he normally gives. it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii. also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again. i can't say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role. all in all a highly recommended film.

sometimes, lady luck smiles on me. i had originally made -- and copied over -- a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation. i was heartbroken when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else.recently, i subscribed to digital cable, and while searching through upcoming movies, there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie. this time, however, i made a copy of it to dvd so there's no chance of repeating my mistake.i finally got to watch it again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it. there is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with "pandora's clock" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. i just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch, and from the first installment, i was hooked. each day, i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read.when i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie, i made sure to clear my schedule for that event.first of all, i'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book, contrary to what another reviewer had said. that, in itself, is a rare achievement for tv movies.secondly, i agree with others about the casting. i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson. literally, the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role. anderson has never been better, and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him. in fact, all of the cast members did a superb job.my only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the "terrorist plot" to arm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane. basically, we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one, and folks, that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved. also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one, then two of its engines blown off.that beef aside, i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film, as well as our own.if you have an opportunity to see this movie, do so by all means.

pandora's clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see. a highly faithful adaptation of john j. nance's novel ,which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel,is made even more so here. despite being made for tv, this is first rate entertainment. the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. jane leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor. daphne zuniga is great as dr. sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. robert loggia, edward herrmann, robert guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.there are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel. the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie. the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they work fine. sets are great, especially cia hq and the oval office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work.it doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. this will leave you breathless.

i began watching a replay of this tv movie on a sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick. i was wrong."pandora's clock" is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most tv movies. it could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen.the cast is excellent, including veteran actors richard dean anderson, edward herrmann, robert guillaume, and robert loggia. daphne zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the cia, and frasier's jane leeves is also very good. the dialogue is well-written and the story is compelling throughout. in fact, the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you can't leave your seat for a second. if you get a chance to see this movie, invest the time -- nearly four hours. you will be richly rewarded!

first off, i didn't know what to expect when i started the video.anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present, something gets inexplicably lost in the translation.that's not the case here. this movie just starts off on the right track. it's part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well. crockzilla scene anyone? that has to be seen, and just try and keep a straight face. this movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production. it's good to see someone is filling the need in this market. very well done.

tsui hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung (i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this, it's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times.this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. when i first saw this, my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kung-fu novels! without a doubt this is one of the best-looking chinese historical kung-fu epic ever made.but alas, tsui hark hasn't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either). to make it worse, this movie is very badly cast. they decided to use the "hot" popular hong kong idols as lead characters, but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody. adam cheng siu-chow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better.i wish that someday zhang yi-mou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of zhang...

this movie is good. it's not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good. first thing first, the story is actually good. the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool. my problem is theres too many characters! it got very confusing when they switched scenes! the special effects were incredible! the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex. this movie practically all computer generated. the acting is superb, as always expected from such high profile players. ekin cheng makes an excellent protagonist, loner character. zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie. i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping. the bad guy, the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening. the music is also excellent. to me this story deserve at least a mini-series and not just one movie. theres too much story to cram in 2 hours. maybe if there was a book or something, i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details. this movie sacrifices story integrity for action. i reccomend storm riders over this any day.

...and i love it. lots of special effects, and for a movie that's not made on mega budget, this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece. i'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story at all, but this was still a great flick to watch. it's definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings, and on par with movies like harry potter. which is saying a lot for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits.one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong. the topic is exotic and original. production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie, and acting is great.one of the best movies to come out of hong kong, this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie, and i hope they'll continue working in this area, until they surpass hollywood adventure movies.just fantastic.

yeah right. sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983's "zu warrios from the magic mountain". now, 2001, he does it again with "zu warriors". but this time, he finally does it right. you seldom see him in wuxia, more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick. but this role simply does fit him! the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies (as far as i know about movies translated for the west). although, the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities. straight said: you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie! and that makes it so great! and wow: all the colors plus the enormously deep, right-into-the-heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant. the first time i watched it, i had to watch it again instantly, and i did. ok true, i didn't understand all of it the first time. but that makes it only better! you know, you didn't understand all of it, because there is so much spice in it! therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again. and yeah, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you watch it.summary: a story to love, characters you cry with, and truly: a movie you never forget! -- editors note: well, i think i must watch it right now again :d

the first thing i thought when i saw this films was: it is not really a film, at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "film". it is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not acquainted with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it's just a fairy-tale... and even a weird one, chaotic. for me "the legend of zu" is perfectly transparent. and i do like it. it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness, the fight that is as old as humanity, and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it. the film is obviously made by buddhists. i am not a buddhist. my religion and the vision of the world and human is different. but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other. it is a really beautiful film! and i which we had more films like this - films that have a meaning. there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly.

"zu:the warriors from magic mountain" was and is an impressive classic! you never would have guessed it was made in 1983. tsui hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions.) even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. "legend of zu" is connected to "zu"warriors from magic mountain"! it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. the plot is a bit hard to follow. but to be honest it doesn't matter. it is all about the action and adventure! i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi. now we know,he made this movie. maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that. there is so much happening on the screen,you simply won't believe! i think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in holland. because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like "superman returns" or xmen 3. the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor! in most of tsui harks's movies he combines drama,fantasy,martial arts and humor. somehow it is missing in this movie. again i am not going to be picky about these small matters. "legend of zu" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. a true classic!

the legend of zu, as i saw it, was a very interesting story. i think many of the people who didn't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film. they were expecting something akin to star wars, and it was not that. joseph campbell, i believe, would have liked this film. there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. we all have a mountain of swords within us. we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. we all have to face our own insomnia someday. granted some of the narration was a bit confusing, and some of the action got a little hokey at times, but i think other points of the film easily made up for it. i'd watch it again. i don't know if there's a difference between the legend of zu (which i saw in mandarin with english subtitles) and zu warriors (the dubbed usa version.) it might have been dumbed down for american audiences, which really would have detracted from this film.

for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects, watch this movie! this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen. you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff.

this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind, tsui hark. it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow's shaolin soccer. from the moment the movie started,there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which weredeplicted with superb style. if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts "geek", you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons. there, comes a fine performance(as always) from ekin cheung who plays "sky king". he teams up with louis koo(red) who i was very impressed by his flexible "wing" which deflected incoming attacks. the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way. not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline. many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just "shoved in random bits of debrise" and even describe as "the legend of poo". however, the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie. others who are famarialy with "wu xia" movies will have a better appoach. in due respect. there can be one weakness that could be foreseen. the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made.in spite of all this, its a must see.

visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark, the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced. the special effects are beautiful and imaginative. the plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons. if thinking is not your forte, however, this may not be your movie. maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio's no brain club, but if you are looking for something more, he's where you will find it.

maybe one of the most entertaining ninja-movies ever made. a hard-hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion (eehaaa!). made in ´83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far! and we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel, ninja mission 2000 - the legacy of markov!

legend of zui remember well tsui hark's original zu warriors made 18 years earlier. over one christmas, on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies, zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog...in fact, i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from. and the memories of seeing yuen biao, sammo hung and others in their classic prime.so when i saw this remake of zu warriors, there was a feeling of apprehension. could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original, or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies?well the answer is i can't say. but that was because this isn't really a remake. the stories (and styles) are almost completely different.the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky, a lone warrior, whose master, dawn, declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia. two hundred years later, insomnia returns, dawn is reincarnated as enigma, and insomnia has returned to destroy zu. meanwhile white eyebrows and red try, with the help of king sky, to stop insomnia.the plot isn't one full of twists and turns, but had enough detail in it to keep me interested. but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate. the film is very much about the special effects, with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments, much like the storm riders and a man called hero. but unlike the other two, this film was one which didn't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. nothing appears rushed - unlike hero. the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes.the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing. it was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks', but generally each character had its part in the story. but some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion, and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this.ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film, but i couldn't say this film showed their best performances. cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting, but it is still quite raw. kelly lin was the new revelation for me. despite her very short role, i have apologise and admit to ogling!overall, i have to say, did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original'. given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades. and one beauty of that is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all, as much as apples are apples and pears are pears.ultimately, both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right. and i'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again.two to watch, but not compare.

according to the director this movie was popular in asia. it is somewhat difficult to take these mats helge movies seriously since most of his films are shot on a very tight budget. almost no usd at all. but it is fascinating to establish that mats helge eventually completes something which can be called an action movie. the ninja mission is - i think - the best one among all movies directed by him. some special effects are quite enjoyable. this is not a "b" or "c" movie. it is a "z" movie - but an enjoyable and fun "z" movie!

this is the magnum opus from the swedish king of crap, mats-helge olsson. seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in swedish film to date. who pays for these things? the russian nuclear scientist markov wants to defect to sweden. but his plans are ruined by the russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in sweden. this trickery is their way of seeing to that markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet. the cia however is bent on getting markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him.the practice of having swedish actors speaking english is something that mats-helge has perfected in his later works. the cheap b-movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance. but besides this? well the action is standard direct-to-video style. machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. thousands of russians dying. people running around in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow.what really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed. when they say "ninja" in the title i expect martial arts, i expect close combat. but there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie. and they are hilarious. it's so bad i lack the words to describe it. if the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop. and of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special-effects budget consisting of four food-stamps and a mcdonald's voucher.so what's the verdict? instant classic of course. never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol. it's the ultimate party movie. insert into video and laugh. one just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more. this is film history.therefore the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.

i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence. a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience, the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayed.the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983. from this new millenium update, we could see tsui hark's vision of the zu mountains. spectacular visual designs, amazing action-fantasy epic made beautifully well. kept me glued through the entire picture. great cast with just fine acting. it's truly a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird?now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie. plot may not have much relation among characters, but by rewatching the movie, you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself. some can complain there isn't too much physical combat, besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes, spirits fighting by hand-to-hand wouldn't really make sense at all. i appreciated this nice stylish picture. it may have a thin story, but hey look at tsui hark's "time & tide," we got confused by the plot as well, but it was truly something stylish and awesome. tsui hark always attracts something different into h.k. cinema. american audiences, may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie, cause this ain't no crouching tiger, hidden dragon, this is a whole new genre. although it may not be a masterpiece, but it's special effects is truly better than storm riders. this is really worth checking out.

i'm stunt, i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene. if you like the fantastic genre, like me, you will certainly be more than satisfied! all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection, in one word, flawless! i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years.

this movie is very cool. if you're a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films, you should love this. this film is the asian lord of the rings: a high fantasy story, based in actual chinese mythology. (i realize many critics have called this film plot-less, i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology.) if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven & earth, this one should be right up your alley. this film is still very difficult to find in the u.s., even though it was purchased for u.s. distribution along with crouching tiger, hidden dragon and iron monkey. well worth the search!!! this dvd is also worthy of owning.

when tsui hark experiments, nothing and no one can withstand him. legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40. one does not understand all, but like at "2001 a space odyssey" you also don't have to, but one feels the power of the film to every second, every picture. an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering, astounding, rejoicing in the recent years. vital severe masterpiece! it's absolutely perfect as it is.when tsui hark experiments, nothing and no one can withstand him. legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40. one does not understand all, but one feels the power of the film to every second, every picture. an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering, astounding, rejoicing in the recent years. vital severe masterpiece! it's absolutely perfect as it is. 10000000000000/10000000000000

i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu. i thought it kicked a*s! it was so creative and unique. it's the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama. even if some thought there was too much special fx(yeah right!), you can't complain about the cast. zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine!!! the legend of zu.....kicks a*s!!!!!!!!

in my mind, this remains one of the very best depictions of superman on tv, as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period.this series paid homage to both the superman films of the '70s/'80s and the superman comics series "reboot" of 1986-onward ("man of steel," "superman vol 2," "action comics," "adventures of superman," etc). the opening score and titles were stirring, based on the john williams score from the films, updated for a saturday morning action series. marv wolfman, one of the main contributors to the comics reboot (writer of "adventures of superman") was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series. overall, the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid-friendly.superman was presented as believable, strong, and iconic. his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his megalomaniac/ceo incarnation. the daily planet characters lois, jimmy, and perry were portrayed well. one of my favorite appearances was by wonder woman, and the story revolved around her home island of themyscira ("paradise island"). both her design and that of her mother hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted wonder woman comic book series of the era, and it seemed like an equally well-done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same.the one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on dvd/blu-ray! it deserves to be.

after the superfriends and scooby doo left the saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986, i pretty much stopped watching saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in. and since neither the real ghostbusters nor the flintstone kids seemed very promising to me, i "retired" and started sleeping in on saturday mornings. i only returned to saturday morning tv in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show. a new animated show of superman was something i was not going to pass up. i was 17 and in high school at the time, but so what! i loved this show. from what i can recall, this series was a gift to fans i suppose in celebration of superman's 50th birthday that particular year. it had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of john williams movie score from the richard donner/christopher reeve superman movies. i honestly felt that the animation style ruby spears did was reminiscent of the super powers team: galactic guardians series by hanna barbera a few years before. sadly, danny dark was not back as superman, but i felt beau weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of superman and his clark kent was nerdy like the chris reeve version. after hearing him as reed richards/mr. fantastic on the 90's fantastic four, i could still see this version of superman in my mind. ginny mcswain as lois lane. lol! what a rhyme. she was a voice director for hanna barbera and ruby spears and i guess she took it upon herself to do lois. memories of the superfriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast. jimmy olsen is mark taylor, who on the superfriends was formerly firestorm. perry white is none other than former batman tv writer stanley ralph ross, who on superfriends was gorilla grodd and brainiac in the super powers shows. and lex luthor, now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than superfriends voice alum, michael bell, whom i know best as zan and the riddler as well as many other characters on many other series. i felt this series was a combination of the movie superman along with the post crisis john byrne re envision of superman, with lex luthor as a billionaire tycoon, jonathan and martha kent being alive to see clark as superman. the bruce timm series and lois and clark would also do this. unfortunately, we never saw brainiac, bizarro, toyman, metallo, or darkseid. other than luthor, we saw only the prankster and we did see general zod. i especially enjoyed that one episode with wonder woman, who was voiced over by bj ward who played her on the super powers team as well. the episodes were smashing and i also enjoyed clark's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to metropolis in the short little segment, superman's family album. the only two things i didn't like. it only lasted one season. and after wonder woman's guest spot, i was hoping batman would turn up voiced over by adam west (still thinking about the super powers team episodes i guess). i also hoped for it because on the prankster episode, the metropolis baseball team was pitted against the gotham goliaths. every popular super hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare. for spiderman, i feel it's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as amazing friends. for the incredible hulk, it's the 1982 cartoon. for the fantastic four, it's the 1978 series with herbie the robot. for batman, it's the new adventures of batman 1977 by filmation featuring batmite. but for superman, the rarest series is this one. superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it. this is another series that wb should consider for dvd release. all in all, this 1988 version of superman is well....super!!

after some difficulty, johnny yuma arrives at his ailing uncle's ranch to take over day to day operations, only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold-digger wife and the woman's vicious brother.good production values, a likable performance by mark damon, and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining, if not exceptionally deep, above average addition to the spaghetti western genre.co-star rosalba neri is one of the hottest european babes ever to grace the screen. here she's absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted user (and abuser) of weak men.damon and neri appeared together in at least one other picture, the devil's wedding night, a pretty good horror movie that's of particular interest for those of you that want to see what's underneath rosalba's dresses.

in the opening scene, the eye patch wearing desperado named hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but when he follows johnny into the pueblo, he's shown with a scar over his patched eye. that's just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy 'spaghetti' western, but rather than detract from the picture, it adds a special flavor to the proceedings.another occurs when sanchez turns in his three dead bodies, they have to be examined for their identities - "you just can't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town". immediately after, carradine (lawrence dobkin) shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand.as for the film's principal johnny yuma (mark damon), he's shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with carradine following the barroom brawl. johnny's bound for san margo at his uncle's request, but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife samantha (rosalba neri) and her conniving brother pedro (louis vanner). it takes some time getting there, but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record. as for that saloon fight, i got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected.care for some more story exaggerations? following the duel with pedro the first time, johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear pedro's entire face with. similarly, when pedro smacks around little pepe later in the film he doesn't cut him, but by the time johnny arrives, pepe's face is covered with blood."johnny yuma" is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have clint eastwood in it. as johnny, mark damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior. carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory lee van cleef character, without being a total bad guy. at first the identity exchange between carradine and johnny didn't seem to make sense, but it all tied together by the time the film ended. you knew each henchman would wind up getting his due; marking time for each was part of the anticipation.in case you're wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with the nick adams character from the classic tv western "the rebel". in this film, johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in yuma once.perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout. after shooting carradine she beats a hasty retreat before johnny can get his revenge. still alive, it looks like carradine tries to shoot her and misses, but it doesn't take long for johnny and sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water - carradine aimed for her canteen.

spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film (so not really spoiler after all). saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it. it's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town. it more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants. among them a couple, where the wife is especially wicked. she lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert. we never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply. she is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty. mark damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor - but that's another story, which i don't remember too good. the remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times i saw a really wicked woman on film, who pretends to be anything but wicked - can't be compared with the witch in 'snowwhite', who, in comparison is easy to find out. very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing.

one of the more satisfying western all'italiana, johnny yuma has the freshness of many wai made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat, intelligent cinema.johnny yuma is, in most respects, not terribly original, but this actually does not count against it. the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements. earlier, pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle (or major) twist that provide continuing interest. the quality of the execution is also, obviously, important. a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience.given these criteria, johnny yuma succeeds. there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films. the setting is the brutal, twisted semi-feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best "gothic family" westerns made 1964-1968 such as tempo di massacre (1966). the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars (1964) plot and the ringo films, a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both. di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the 1960s-70s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre (along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors, directors, and screenwriters). in the fod plot, the protagonist arrives in town, stirs up a tense situation, then undergoes a near-death followed by a resurrection (in some films, like quella sporca storia nel west (1968) it is quite literally a crucifixion). the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist/explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films. the ringo plot, developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma, a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty).the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of manco/mortimer from a fistful of dollar (1965). the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two. numerous films, including da uomo a uomo (1968) or even el chuncho, quién sabe? (1967), use this relationship between an older and younger man (father/son, older/younger brother, anglo adviser/adversary and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic to the plot.additionally, there is the focus on deception and misdirection, mazes and mirrors, that recur throughout the best early wai. the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse.what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriri's use of visual/psychological space together arrangement with the script's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot. dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible (thought there are exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in django (1966) or faccia a faccia (1967).psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery, it's juxtapositions, and it's description of the overall narrative situation. see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the roof or from the background of the action. or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch, hotel, even bedroom (this, again, is a theme from fod). finally, note how there is a focus on the search for information. like many elements, this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hard-boiled mystery novel red harvest. it is through incidental contacts, wanted posters, overheard conversations, glances out of windows, watches left in the dust, or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it's conclusion.the movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence. of course, these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns. what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed, which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed. johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film.what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous, nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest. the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself  some flint debitage from a prehistoric site, a shard of cruse pottery, or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal  but it is reference to some nameless presence, lives, that were significant simply because they existed. while johnny yuma has intrinsic worth, much of it's interest for me derives from this connection and mystery.top spaghetti western list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907average sws http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849889for fanatics only (bottom of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849890

this wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the spaghetti western so exciting and fun: great music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, nora orlandi), exciting action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and beautiful scenery and sets (all in almeria, spain, of course). it also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. the actors do marvelous jobs--with truly standout performances from lawrence dobkin and rosalba neri (in the most vital role for a female in a spaghetti western..outside of cardinale in leone's "once upon a time in the west"). without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film i have ever seen!

this is a very memorable spaghetti western. it has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from rosalba neri. her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. her performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.the music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done.i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill/bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma's cowardly mexican sidekick. i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him? all that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.

i have previously seen zu: warriors from the magic mountain. in that film, the setting takes place in china's mountains, the legend of zu looks like another dimension!! thank that to tsui hark's extensive use of cgi effects. he's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the ultra cool moon orb.while there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma. the romance aspect is there, although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor. cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching. in the beginning, i like how she resembles the countess (from zu warriors) and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life. oh, by the way, did i mention that cecilia's very appealing to the eye??in truth, zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.

i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero (my all time favourite), storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too. i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin cheng's acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far (way better than nicolas tse nevertheless)and he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie. without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film. they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that. the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (i guess ekin cheng pulls the girls easily).the story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie. i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities, but well that's life and it never goes the way you want it to. and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end ? that's way too funny. legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all. if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements. good work. please make more fantasy movies like this

most complaints i've heard of this film really come down to one thing: it isn't versus. yes, the cast and crew is basically the same. yes, kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film's second half, but that's about where the similarities end. versus takes place essentially all outside, showcasing kitamura's ability to craft an interesting b-movie in natural locations. for alive, almost everything takes place inside. in small, cramped spaces. here the art design is thrust into your face, and what art design it is! we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces. also a key difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the film. versus was all about action and cool, here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind. because of this, alive is a far more interesting film than versus. you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed, but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters.i'm now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay. you should too! but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus - it's often slow, and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it. i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release!

this is like "crouching tiger, hidden dragon" in a more surreal, fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame. the plot may be hard to follow, but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen; certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience. however, an intelligent person should be able to keep up; moreover, the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi.

an inventive, suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia. a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms. not completely successful, but taut, surprising and well-acted. one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw  two men trapped in room and pitting against each other  but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film. it's like watching a lab experiment. some might find the contained suspense tedious, but this reviewer found it enthralling. the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized. this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system. just right for a late night movie fest, when one is in the paranoid mood. it certainly kept me awake that night.

tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. when he survives electrocution the government officials give him a choice to either be electrocute at a greater degree or agree to some experiments. he chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution. they can have whatever the want in the room (within reason), but they can't leave. after a few days there meals are cut down to one per day and the room temp is set up too 100. after some more alarms are sounded at intervals so they can't sleep. one day a 'witch' come into their cell (albeit a glassed off portion) what happens next i'll let you find out. i may be in the minority here but i liked the build up, it was intriguing to me. now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was i would have rated this so much higher.my grade: c+ media blaster's 2 dvd set extras: disc 1) director's cut; trailers for "versus", "aragami", "attack the gas station", and "deadly outlaw rekka" disc 2) theatrical cut; commentary with hideo sakaki, ryuhei kitamura, sakaguchi takuand tsutomu takahashi; cast and crew interview; making of; original trailer; and promo teasers

the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells, waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair. then our "hero", who is called tenshu, is taken to the chair, he's zapped, and then....he's still "alive". aha ! he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you". our hero says yes to option 2, and then the actual story commences. he wakes up in a different sort of cell (very high-tech and very big), where he finds another cell-mate, who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride. a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish, as long as it happens within that room. sounds a little suspicious, but the two men accept : what else can they do ? what these two men do not know is that they have been set together, so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them. basically the unknown scientists in the background p**s them off until they decide that they should kill each other. sounds weird ? indeed, but there's a greater purpose to all of this. this is the part which should not be revealed, and so it shall remain unrevealed. but fear not, it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-action movie, fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : how long time can you stand being with a man who's an s.o.b. and would you kill him to obtain freedom ? the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it sneaks up without you actually knowing it. then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix-like action fight-scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon. the movie is indeed very special, so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances. however, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic, and the actors do their bit (some more than others) to make the movie truly unique. if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it, watch it, and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash.

alivealive is a very entertaining sci-fi movie from japan. i have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved versus this director's debut film or his third film azumi. i have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies. frankly i went to the video store to get versus but i am just fine with alive.if you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then alive is not your pick. there is plenty of action however it comes as pay-off for a whole hour of character driven build-up. personally i think it is well done and worth it.of course some of the plot is silly as with many sci-fi action films and i think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect. this film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply.they kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground building(taking a cue from the cube) but the film doesn't suffer for it. another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many flashbacks and dream sequences. rent this!

i found this movie to be very well-paced. the premise is quite imaginative, and as a viewer i was pulled along as the characters developed. the pacing is done very well for those that like to think--enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on, and questions keep arising which are later answered, producing a well-thought out and very satisfying film, both cerebrally and from an action standpoint.it seems some people were looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with this film--one of those that comes charging out of the gate. this would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill--creating a wonderful sense of anticipation--and is ultimately, in my mind, more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid.excellent film.

i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. i saw it at an independent film festival, so don't expect it to come to your town anytime soon. during the film, i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out. too bad for them (down here in the south, folks don't like having to read subtitles). the movie starts out slow, but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored. when the action finally arrives, i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster.i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters, especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen. it reminded me of zelda (ocarina of time) when you face level bosses.if this is the future of "video game/comic book" movies, then i welcome it.

i've been a fan of xu ke (hark tsui) for many year since school. this film is the best fantasy movie in years. i dont think "action" is the right genre, though there're lot of action and kongfu scenese. wait, did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive? please, keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film. and for the guy who "poo" around, i don't blame you, 'cause you still young and need to know more about "culture".

this is one amazing movie!!!!! you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical. there are always stories behind stories. i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore (i studied them in school)it is very complicated. you just have to take what it gives you.....enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride....hooray!!!!

o my gosh... just give me a minute to breath. this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending. this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such. legend of zu was beautifully created, although i didn't like a few things, they used alot of stand ins. i wanted to see the real person fight but, oh well... a few small let downs,and i didn't really like it a lot until i watched it again, when you understand it more it totally kicks a**! i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie, to see this movie. i give this movie one of my highest ratings.go and see it when it comes out in america!!!

i can't tell you all how much i love this movie. i have read reviews that say that this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in drying concrete". i say that these reviewers have no imagination! for anyone who loves fantasy fiction, this movie is for you. if you ever loved playing dungeons & dragons... this movie is for you, (especially if you got into the oriental adventures) i'm just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen. (just more incentive to get my own big screen t.v. :-)

legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years. it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions, legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty. this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. the acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think you'd keep more to yourself.unlike the comments of many, the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency. anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic. the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air. legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur. allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie.

i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it, part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night. after several awful american action adventure films (ballistic, daredevil, cradle of life) zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking. the story is complete nonsense, but i found the film's sincerity, good- heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. sure, the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood, but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking. in one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock, a huge moon rising before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. in another, a princess-warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. and the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotion rather than to represent reality.the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters, offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. physically, several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful. they play their roles straight up, without irony or guile, and so are believable.most strange of all, despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations, i found myself very near tears at the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, good-hearted vision of the director.

this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is (5.9/10(576 votes) as of this writing). this movie has incredible special effects, a true epic storyline, complex great character interaction, and mind-blowing battles - they have to be seen to be believed! the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got (some lines were not translated - ???).i just don't understand when i read & hear from various sources: "it has a confusing plot....", "i couldn't follow the story...." or "characters came from nowhere...". from the very 1st time i watched this movie, i understood it, followed it, knew why characters were there, and i absolutely loved it! i've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment. oh, and this is not just my opinion, because i've shown this movie to many fellow americans (people who have never seen an hk film before) who feel the same way. not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie. oh man, why can't we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood? at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects, character development, and storyline.this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either. i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds. when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won't want to leave! i've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 (both done by tsui hark), and the 2001 is far better in comparison imo.besides the subtitles, i have one additional complaint about this movie: i didn't want it to end.... i'm begging you mr. hark - can we please have a sequel?

i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero's every week.you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure.oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies.so any ole way i believe i've got what i wanna say.would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,if this is so then i must go so lets do it.

the freedom of having your own sea going power boat, the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged,an's man of an adventurer and lovely(and so well endowed!) assistants in fine bikinis were all definite selling points for "sea hunt"(1958-61).just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going "gun for hire"* series. let's look closely now. there must be a some clues around.if we were to look back just a little, we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater! (1955). it starred jane russell, gilbert roland, richard egan and lori nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working on salvage in the carribbean, including a pre-fidel cuba. the film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits. fine, shapely women folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits (woo, woo, woo, woo!) are always a plus for the guys; and the presence of rugged, athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake "poses" is equally pleasing to the gals.and there is one element that is a true legacy of this old rko feature. it is on the soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes. it is the recording of "it's cherry pink and apple blossom white", written by louiguy and jacques larue and performed by damaso perez prado and his orchestra.anyone who hears this insturmental or song (with lyrics)will not soon forget it. its carribbean beat is so very lively and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory. the 45 rpm record of this song made it to the top 10 most popular songs of the week for many saturday evenings on nbc tv's "your hit parade". we can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got. (maybe some one can fill us in on that one item, please!) so, we got back to "sea hunt" and its own odyssey in getting on "the tube". the public had taken to underwater! all right, but would they go for a tv series.ziv tv productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that, for the most part, didn't get signed on by the networks for the multi-station hook-up treatment. but they had been having some great successes with television syndication.** by that we mean, offering a series for stations for showings on a one to a tv station per each market area. (much like the various newspaper syndicates "sell" comic strips to various papers around the country, and world, even.so, we got 'mike nelson', himself, in the physical presence of lloyd bridges. mr. bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of boston blackie movies (with chester morris)to they stooge to conga (3 stooges 1943), sahara (also 1943), home of the brave (1949) and the whistle at eaton falls(1951).lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization, along with a fine, convincingly athletic physique, having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities. he took very well as the diver's diver, whether it's performing duties on board ship, or fathoms beneath the sea.and lloyd did take to the role quickly, but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there, he was not familiar with s.c.u.b.a.*** prior to landing this mike nelson gig. but the athletic mr. bridges proved to be a quick learner, as so many of the close-up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it, that it was lloyd with the mask, the bubbler(air tank) and the flipper fins.stories almost always involved the helping-out some client for pay, much like a private detective would. so what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit, all the better.like so many of the other ziv/united artists tv productions,"sea hunt" possessed a fine, haunting opening theme and closing, along with some original incidental music and queues.at one time, i believe that "sea hunt" was the top syndicated tv series, a success that ziv series had known before with the likes of "science fiction theatre"and "highway patrol". as far as the showing venue for this underwater saga, here in chicago it was shown late night (after 10:30 p.m.) on wnbq tv, channel 5 (our nbc affiliate, now known as wmaq tv).and i can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was. and there were even on scene commercials done by the star! how well we can remember and visualize lloyd as mike nelson, riding on his power boat. and as we were being invited to return the next week and watch ".....another adventure of "sea hunt", sponsored by the g. heileman brewing company of lacrosse, wisconsin' the makers of old style lager beer!", all while mike was toasting us, raising an old style bottle. (shame on you, mike! drinking beer on your moving boat! we're tellin' the coast guard!) then, the boat would leave the dock, accompanied by the sea hunt theme and rolling the credits.note: * more figuratively than literal, mike was for hire and things ran very much like a deterctive story.note: ** ziv's syndicated successes included "science fiction theatre", "west point"(and its clone "men of annapolis"), "sea hunt" and "highway patrol".note*** and of course, scuba is a acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus.

lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series. what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater. the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious.the show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro, mike nelson. there were excellent shows, and the program always appeared to be well produced. granted, the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds it's own with any other show produced during this era, the infancy of american television.

i loved watching ''sea hunt '' back in the day , i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch ''sea hunt '' and mike nelson in his underwater adventures .i loved it ! he took to you a place not very accessible at that time , under the great blue sea . pre ''thunderball '' or even before cousteau became common , there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids .i'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show .underwater photography also progressed , the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show . watch and enjoy !!!

what a night. perry mason then have gun, will travel followed by gunsmoke (when it was a half hour) and finally at 10:30pm came 'sea hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and mike's boat sailing off to a new adventure. terrific.. regardless of the story it was the lead character (played by lloyd bridges), strong, honest, sincere. a man's man and a boy's man. this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years. why they don't show on cable or make it available on video, no idea.. too bad.

attention, spoiler!many people told me that «planet of the apes» was tim burton's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film. so i decided not to see it. another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet, advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a tim-burton-movie is still a tim-burton-movie'. i decided to do it, and i found that he was right.it's clear that a remake of such a famous film as `planet of the apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. still, tim burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `beetlejuice' or `batman'. if you are already fond of burton-movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some flaws: nerve-racking monkey squeals, over-dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been, without difficulties, replaced by anbody else.what the film gives us in the first place, is an answer to the question: what's the result when tim burton is instructed to create a remake? first of all, burton wouldn't be burton, if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start; it's a `re-imagining'. on the other hand, burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston (as human), and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared. so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes. concerning the story-line, burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first, and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  and here is the spoiler  leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever. now, this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing, shocking ending of the first `planet of the apes'. an ending, even more unexpected, more astonishing and: completely confusing, because  and here i'm disagreeing with various `planet of the apes'-homepages and -platforms  it does not make any sense. there cannot be a meaning to it, or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective. tim burton is playing his cruel games, he does it with a grin and he does it well. burton fans will sure like it, others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism. well, and i don't think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake again

....after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me!!!! whatever happened to the old burton who read "the dark knight returns" by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988-89? by the looks of it burton didn't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong! this movie sucks! it's not as good as the original and it doesn't deal with the same subject as the original. if you want a good ape movie watch the original.**out of****stars

take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. it's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. visually, it's incredible. everything else was just ok. for what it is, i think the movie is awesome, but i like everything burton has done. people need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b/c of this movie. it wasn't supposed to be a remake, and it's not. the ending was cool. . i took it as a parallel universe.

charleton heston wore one, james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth. i hope no one casts him as tarzan. linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. she's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. this movie has three great actors tim roth, ms. carter & paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch. superlative make up (a certain oscar) costumes, sets, music make this the hit summer movie of 2001.

i read the book and saw the movie. both excellent. the movie is diamond among coals during this era. liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw. this film should have made them stars. shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film. it could have easily been a franchise. release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film. look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. you won't be disappointed. do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). it'll blow you away. times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have.

gordon parks, the prolific black life magazine photographer, made a true ticking-timebomb of a movie here - one that does not mess around! based upon the true story of two nyc cops - later dubbed batman and robin - who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs, this is a cop-buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula. lightning paced, there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here.man, early '70s nyc must have been a terrible place to be a police officer, from the looks of movies like this and "serpico." these two cops start out as safety-division rookies, busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time. but instead of receiving applause from the city police department, they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers. they have to singlehandedly navigate a minefield of police and legal corruption, boneheaded assignments meant to keep them from their work on the streets, ruthless drug kingpins, and a nasty ghetto neighborhood.both david selby and ron leibman are fantastic in the leads; part of the entertainment is watching leibman's eyes darting around crazily in every scene in what is a flawless comic performance, and selby's acting is low-key and wry. these two make all the comedy aspects of the story work - displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination. director parks, who was already known for his coverage of controversial subjects in his photography, does not shy away from the grittiness of the story. rather, the movie is uncompromising in portrayal of the toughness of the world of police and streets criminals that these two men inhabit. adding to this realism is the fact that the real hantz and greenberg acted as technical advisors for the film, and even appear in surreal cameo roles as two fellow officers who ridicule the protagonists. it is a real tribute to the effectiveness of parks' direction that he manages to perfectly balance this depressing mileu with bright comedy.why has mgm/ua let this sit on the shelf for 30 years - barely giving it a home video or dvd release in the u.s? it is a minor masterpiece from the 1970s.

this film has slipped through the cracks of film history. it is by far much better than some other new york films of the same era such as: "the french connection" or "the taking of pelham 1-2-3". there is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line. it's engaging from start to finish and hasn't tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples.ron liebman turns in a bravura performance as "batman" and it's a shame his career didn't take off as a result of this project.gordon parks directs and, coming as it does after "shaft", it at first appears to be a strange choice. yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo.unfortunately this film has not been made available on either dvd or vhs in the united states. united artists really has a gem on their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with it.

this is an excellent little movie! the acting is good and the music is fantastic!! play it on a 5-1 sound system and enjoy! it will never win any awards but its good clean fun for all!! i recommend this movie to all fans of pretty girls funny and hansom men as well as robot lovers everyone!!1 p.s. it also stars lisa rinna! enjoy!!this is a very hard movie to find, it is out of print. i first saw it on showtime many years ago but recently found a used vhs copy. its still a must see for all!!!this is an excellent little movie! the acting is good and the music is fantastic!! play it on a 5-1 sound system and enjoy! it will never win any awards but its good clean fun for all!! i recommend this movie to all fans of pretty girls funny and hansom men as well as robot lovers everyone!!1 p.s. it also stars lisa rinna! enjoy!! dave engle this is a very hard movie to find, it is out of print. i first saw it on showtime many years ago but recently found a used vhs copy. its still a must see for all!!!

at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles. the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between 'demons', bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse.be prepared: following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement.

gojoe is part of a new wave of japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historic themes, what the japanese call "period pieces". gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography, and editing. brilliant, even. the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in kurosawa's samurai epics, or the zaitochi series. another fine example of this genre is onmyoji (2001). i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors. other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include yomada's twilight samurai (2002) and shintaro katsu's zatoichi: the blind swordsman (2003).

well, if you are one of those katana's film-nuts (just like me) you sure will appreciate this metaphysical katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick.starring tadanobu asano (vital, barren illusion) & ryu daisuke (kagemusha). this samurai war between heiki's clan versus genji's clan touch the zenith in the final showdown at gojo bridge. the body-count is countless.demons, magic swords, shinto priests versus buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro sogo ishii will do the rest.a good japanese flick for a rainy summer night.

gojoe takes a little getting used to at first, but the final result is very satisfying. the tale, about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate, but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. there is a lot at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. the movie may seem a bit similar to other anime-inspired samurai film at first, but it does eventually delve into more mature/adult territory soon after.not to be missed. gojoe is one of the better samurai movies to come around post-kurosawa.8 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)

as incredible as it may seem, gojoe is an anime- and hong kong-inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message. this ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a great acting job done by daisuke ryu), a killer-turned-to-boddhist-monk benkei. benkei has sworn never to kill again, but he still takes up the sword to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion...gojoe is a film difficult to rate. it's visual imagery is stunningly crafted and beautiful, but it uses too much trickery (circling camera and high speed drives, expressionistic shots, leeched colors, digital effects etc.), so the end result is somewhat tiring. that said, the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful. if only the director sogo ishii would have been wise enough not to overuse his bag of tricks.other problem with gojoe is the amount of violence. for a film with such an anti-violent message gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes. also, the way the violence is shown is always on the edge of being self-indulgent; in fact, a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the films signature images. luckily, ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence as well. still, it seems that ishii is not sure whether he's making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory. the audience can't be sure of this, either, until the very end of the film. the powerful (albeit cynical) ending is what saves gojoe; it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore-fest.

another attempt by modern japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. successful, and not, in varying degrees.buddhist monk has a vision that he is to slay a legendary (and very active) demon at the gojoe bridge in order to attain enlightenment. while not at the forefront, buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie, much like kurosawa's "ran". it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although it's nowheres near "ran's" league. stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length. the lead actors are uniformly excellent. the music is really good. the two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes. the movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing. and the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups. this works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat. another recent film like this is tsui hark's "seven swords", great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing. asano really doesn't move like a sword wielding demon, his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scene.good movie, you'll probably find it interesting just don't expect traditional sword fights.

i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the director's other films in the past. i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge. it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled.i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes. they were hard to follow at times.ultimately, a moral tale. it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film. it is a film i would like to see again.some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a "psychic" level were well done.i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here. intense.

sogo ishii has taken the old myth of musashibo benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark, gory, spellbinding and terrific-looking movie. those unfamiliar with the legend won't need to be; the story explains itself nicely as it goes along. well worth seeking out even though there are no english-language home video versions.

i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i loved how this move was unlike crouching tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close.i think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of mahayana buddhist text (mahayana buddhism can be found in china, korea and japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... gojoe has the action, story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. i strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the u.s. my one complaint is in the last fight scene (i can't give anything away--sorry).

i personally thought the movie was pretty good, very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame. i really can't say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me a little too much, and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy. other than that however, the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot, great effects, and a lot of sword play. another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion. well i really can't say anymore about the movie, but if you're only outlook on asian cinema is crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers, i would suggest you trying to rent it, but if you're a die-hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film.

one of the less widely lauded of recent asian period action affairs gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering, exciting, layered and beautiful. i'm sad to say i know virtually nothing of the buddhist philosophy or japanese history and legend that surrounds this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me, but even without contextual knowledge this is still rich fare, taking a traditional fantasy structure into a, impactful higher plane. the story is of benkei, a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of gojoe bridge: prince shanao, himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons. thus the film becomes a matter of illusions and in benkei's case, indecision, a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge, for benkei to come to terms with his true nature and for prince shanao to come face to face with the nature of what he seeks to become. benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world, even when not in open conflict he is never at ease. director sogo ishii handles this one as an epic, with measured pace, camera work always stylish and often frenzied, without neglecting the need for more sedate moments to let the location sink in, there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere, there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy. the cinematography of makoto watanbe is important here, vivid and detailed, a richly evocative affair. actingwise daisuke ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as benkei, while tadanobu asano has a driven, cold arrogance as prince shanao. of the leads masatoshi nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man, smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are. the film all fits together well, it is however a touch flabby at times, it begins slowly, some shots are a little drawn out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary. as for the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves, it has artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans, often obscured by objects, flashing blades and fast moving individuals, whirling with deadly force through their adversaries are the order of the day, it is invigorating to watch but in the end i could have done with a little more traditionalism. there is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well, it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting. overall though i found this to be a pretty great film, its not one for regular action fans or swordplay enthusiasts seeking another azumi, rather a deeper and more mystical beast, its ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of such fare. but as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more adventurously inclined it might do so too. well recommended at any rate.

this movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies. many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won't understand why i find it so enthralling so i will try to explain...the movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights, and while it has a few minor anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. the story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk benkei and the young prince yoshitsune on gojo bridge. during the fight according to legend yoshitsune bests benkei and the monk becomes the prince's loyal retainer. this movie is a revision of that story however and involves war, dark prophecy, and political maneuvering.one of the main themes in the movie is "mappo", which is the prophecy by the buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. it was believed in heian japan, after the eruption of mt fuji and the civil war between the taira (heike) and the minamoto (genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. it is a time of demons.next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of yoshitsune's sword training by the tenku (raven goblins) of karuma. defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off. this is said to be where ninja clans began historically. yoshitsune's depiction in gojo nicely accommodates all of this.then there is benkei, and the various strains of buddhism depicted, including a lot of esoteric buddhism of the shingon sect. these are all depicted quite accurately, and just to add a little extra, the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story, i.e. it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing.all-in-all it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly true-to-life for the period. the scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic. the soundtrack is great, very brooding and ominous. i also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good. benkei is a great brooding anti-hero, shanao (yoshitsune)is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power, and tetsukichi the scavenging sword-smith makes for and interesting depiction of the "common man" and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters.as to the plot, to see why it is so good, i really suggest you dig up an old book on japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted robin hood vs little john story into a gory tale of intrigue, violence and infernal karma.

i happily admit that i'm a sucker for a beautiful film, and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film. not one the length of gojoe though, even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography i've seen since the korean period piece musa. however, gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images (as does musa... don't which to imply a contrast) - it's second greatest strength is superb acting, and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy. i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end, but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way. vague ones, but definitely thoughts :pone department in which the film could have been better is the action. there's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups, and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground. it does create some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves, something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone.still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films i've seen for quite some time. recommended!

i have seen virtually all of cynthia rothrock's films, and to me this is the funniest. it reminds me of early jackie chan movies. admittedly, ms rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady. this film, while probably not the best of all her films, was the most entertaining.

i've recently watched this movie, in a lazy sunday afternoon, with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun! this movie is a masterpiece of trash. try to watch it with this purpose! it hadn't been expected, of course, but the performance provided by the actors (and alberto tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script and the low-cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things. tomba was just retired from alpine ski racing, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. tomba won three olympic gold medals, two world championships, and nine world cup season titles. seriously about the director: nobody knows why damiano damiani he has signed this movie. all the other damiani's directions are considerable.

that film is absolutely fantastic!! if you watch it with your friends it can be a very nice day... obviously you have to know that the film is stupid and very bad directed and acted (tomba/unziker what a couple), and that is probably the worse film in the world, but you can enjoy it very much. we watched it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. the best scenes are the first one, when the criminals kill the friend of alex, and he tries to act like a desperate, and the result is a comic scene of first category... and then when he shows to leva (antevleva, what a name) the "palassio di giusstissia", and then the accident of leva, that once is going on her car out of the road, and a second later, the car is completely empty! what a magic!

the acting is pretty cheesy, but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area automotive engineers, this is a great movie. i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny.jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show! he looks pretty young here...17 years ago. the opening scene, with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great.leno also owns some bad a** cars now, it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection. i'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car.typical 80s movie. watch it and enjoy. no computer generated crap!

this movie stars jay leno as a detroit cop, tony costas and pat morita as a tokyo cop sent to detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor. a japanese man traveled to detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named derrick jarryd. unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. an angry derek jarryd tries to distance himself from phillip madras who led the men. but madras(played by chris sarandon) has none of it and threatens jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership. meanwhile in the same junk yard where the japanese man had been killed, a friend of tony costas was also killed by the same men. tony's friend had been watching the junk yard.tony sets out to find the killer against his superior's order. tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case. while tony is investigating the crime he runs into the japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him. eventually they end up working together on the case. they make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as pat morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking madras in the head. but it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. jay leno is no actor, but he is likable in the role and pat morita is good as well. still, they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film. if you liked buddy cop films, cheesy 80's movies or you want to see jay leno as an actor then i recommend this movie.

i saw this movie on cable, it was really funny, from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys, jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part. i compare this movie to "rush hour" in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case. the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories. enjoyable soundtrack, good script, i give it 10/10.

centered in the downtown and out skirts of detroit, this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo. 'noriyuki pat morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. pat's character collides with 'jay leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type detroit cop. when they cross paths though, the honorable 'ways' of japan meet the all-out old school detroit police investigative 'ways'. the two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. after battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. a little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. i rated this a 9. lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy. fun for all ages. i recommend it highly.(***)

well no, i tell a lie, this is in fact not the best movie of all time, but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody i know has seen.it's a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat morita(mr miyagi) with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something, but that doesn't matter. the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads, who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends. the whole culture difference thing is done quite well,in that it's fun to watch, it's completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way. the soundtrack is cool,once again in a cheesy 80's kind of way, it suits the movie, i've been trying to find one of the songs for ages, but as i'm working from memory of what i think a few of the words were i can't seem to find it.another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever, but i won't give that one away, oh no! in conclusion i'd take this movie over 48 hours\most of eddie murphys output including beverly hills cop, and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their names. if you're looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with "straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop" give this a shot. you might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with "straight japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop".i'm giving this 7. to be honest i like it more than that. i'd rather watch this than a lot of stuff i'd give 8. but i guess i know deep down that it's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie.

okay, i know i shouldn't like this movie but i do. from pat morita's loveable interpretation of a japanese stereotype to jay leno's annoying yell, i laughed throughout this movie.as long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it's a good mvie.my favorite part is morita talking to his boss in tokyo with the drinking a close second.

i saw this movie recently. 2 hours later, my head still hurt from laughing. the plot was soo awful, the jokes were soo bad, but what i didn't count on were:1. the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing (that caused more than enough laughter)2. the kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil-doer.this movie is about 20 times better than the rush hour series, and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn't like the movie, send certificate to hbo. while i considered it, the date you had to send it in was january 1991 (which also caused wackiness to ensue).

this movie will go down down in history as one of the greats, right along side of citizen kane, casablanca, and on the waterfront. someone please convince leno to do a sequel! leno and morita are a comedy duo, the likes of which haven't been seen since abbot and costello. the evil that emanates from chris sarandon, tom noonan, and randall "tex" cobb will give you the chills. dingman's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of shakespeare's comedies. and the climax. my goodness, the climax. i won't ruin it for you, but it makes the explosion of the death star pale in comparison. if you can track down this hard-to-find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. i'm still holding out hope for a special edition dvd one of these days.

i'm a huge fan of the twin sisters. although this was one of their "not soo good" movies. i'm not saying it's bad, i can't say it's bad, but this whole popular and not popular thingy isn't good. although i give this movie a 4.

i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of mary-kate's and ashley's characters sam and emma stanton! they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but; unfortunately, it's just not that easy for them to actually do! i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i'm sure that you'll agree with me here! if you haven't seen this movie yet then i say you really missed-out; big time, and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now! this movie is a real winner! sincerely, rick morris

this movie is so good i could watch it all day long! mary-kate and ashley were robbed at oscar time!! if i got to be one of the actors i would be so excited!!! i can't wait for the new charlie's angels movie starring mary-kate and ashley.

i, as a teenager really enjoyed this movie! mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease. i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to! be sure and rent it!! also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players! :)

i think that this movie was reasonbaly good. it's kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house. anyway, the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny. i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names. it's just kind of an older version of it takes two.

i do find it a bit overrated. maybe it's just because i've never seen a subtitled version (dubbing stinks!), but i just don't get into it like a lot of other people do. the finale is really great though as jackie trashes a mall, a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping!

i saw this on a cantonese vcd with the english subtitles. i thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting. this took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. if the musical score was improved i could overlook the few overacted scenes. then the film would be much, much better.

i have not seen each and every one of chan´s movies, but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far.the story in it self is nothing special really, so i won´t go deeper into that. what makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it. all the cool stunts (of course made by jackie himself)makes you want jump around in the couch and scream. it´s just awesome! even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it.i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in sweden. but i can assure you, it´s worth a try.

this movie is jackie's best. i still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever. i also like the bad guys in this movie (the old man looks like a chinese version of john howard). unlike some of jackie's other work, this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of jackie's fans.

jackie chan's classic directorial feature police story (1985) is among the most influential and over-the-top modern day police actioners ever to come out from hong kong. jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other "urban" action which would later become very popular and typical among hk directors like john woo and ringo lam. police story mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds.jackie plays chan ka-kui, a police who gets to protect an important witness (brigitte lin) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity. jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet maggie cheung, who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like heroic trio (and the sequel) by johnnie to, savior of the soul by corey yuen and david lai and many many others. the plot in police story is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place.jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes, some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which jackie hits his head (near the eye) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass. also jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film. the scene in which a bus stops right before jackie, spitting the kidnappers through the windshield, went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to. they were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries. during the end credits, there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless, but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely.the action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by (action) director chan. the now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver. jackie always tells how important editing is (which is true) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to hollywood efforts, for instance. there's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch.but there is again one negative point which i cannot stand in hk action comedies, which is this comedy itself. the comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there, without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue. i mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare, and he is there to "murder" that girl. this kind of acting is stupid and inept and i wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre. characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those "loud thoughts" are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and "light." even if the film is comic and not so serious, these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily.police story is a fast speed, full impact, balls to the walls action adventure miracle from hong kong and from the time when jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the us produced the protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director james glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and jackie and he returned to hong kong to make more personal and inventive film. that he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's. this is among the most insane action films ever, and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws i mentioned. 7/10

although john woo's hard boiled is my number 1 favorite movie. but i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie. i say this because the stunts, the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when jackie chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor. ouch! buy it at amazon.com for 14:98.

rated pg-13 for violence, brief sexual humor and drug content. quebec rating:13+(should be g) canadian home video rating:14ai have seen police story a couple of times now.in my opinion police story is chan's best film from the 80's.he originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was the protector.i have not seen the protector so i cant compare.the acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good.i don't remember the plot well because i saw this film a while back but what i do remember is this film has lots of great action,stunts and comedy just what a good chan film needs.if you can find police story and you are chan fan then buy this film! runtime:106min 9/10

well, i would consider police story as one of jackie chan's best film. the plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent. in this film, jackie himself acted as a police officer called chan ka kui (kevin chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. after the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed chan for the killing of a police officer. due to this, he became wanted by the police. later on, salina (brigitte lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to chan. however, the crime lord knew that salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. later on, chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen, defeating them one by one. at the last scene, chan was seen punching the crime lord. lastly, this is the best action and comedy movie. everyone should watch it. highly recommended.

maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best jackie chan's movies, but i think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. there also was some memorable stunts, which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film (like they could remake that chase scene, i thing with modern technologies they could make it even better). there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn't fighting. althou i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film.

it's depressing to see where jackie chan has ended up. he used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. to be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. but with 'rush hour 3', where he takes a back seat to chris tucker (of all people!), and then there's 'kung fu panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue... to say that jackie chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement.it's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old vhs tape and watch jackie kick some arses in his younger, fitter, chris tucker-free days.enter 'police story'. jackie chan plays kar-kui, a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial. he faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.but on the other hand, who cares? we don't watch jackie chan films for the story. we watch them to see jackie chan perform eye-popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is.and on that level, 'police story' doesn't disappoint at all. there is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in jackie sliding down a giant, high-voltage chandelier. seriously, if this sort of thing happened more often, no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.there is also comedy, much of which involves kar-kui inadvertently upsetting may (maggie cheung), his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend. the humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so i'm not complaining.the acting isn't too subtle, either. indeed, i'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'police story' at all. director jackie chan (yeah, he does that too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.so 'police story' is a blast. as is the case with most of his films, the fact that jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition. i mean, when jackie chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new "wow!" factor is added to the action.

jackie chan's police story is a landmark film for both the honk kong action genre and the career of jackie chan.directed/written by chan, police story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre, and like most of the the films of police storys' kind, the script is nothing to be raved about. but the plot of the film is jackie chan, who plays a nice guy cop, struggling to convict the local gang lord.the direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that jackie chan has given us, that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece "miracles". however the job that jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable. the standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes.the performances in this film also vary with jackie giving a very solid typical chan nice guy up against it role, but this is by no means his best acting role, that can been seen in the sammo hung directed film "heart of the dragon". the other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as jackie with bridgete lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well, but neither does she display full acting potential. the standout acting comes from maggie cheung as jackies' suffering girlfriend and bill tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief. none of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film. the action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised, modern setting, the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera. to begin with there is a shootout in the slum where koo (ganglord) is making a drug deal, whilst being no john woo style sequence, this serves as a nice starter for the film. this is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight. this is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by bad boys 2. in the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as jackie tries to transport bridgete lin from her house to his. this is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films. this sequence is fantastically choreographed, timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene. however, as tradition dictates, the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film. this sequence displays some of chans' best choreography, stunts and camera/editing work. this sequence is now famous for two things, the amount of people sent through high density glass, which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people, and the stunt at the end where jackie leaps from a 5th storey balcony, grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof (this has to be seen to be believed). whilst the two for-mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant, i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is chans' ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography, that for me has never been bettered. i also believe that the action in police story is some of the best filmed and edited action of chans career helping to set the action apart from others.overall, police story, despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding, is one of the best action films of all time displaying chans best choreography, best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone. afterall, we watch a chan movie for the action!!

police story is one of jackie chan's classic films that helped shape the hong kong cinema. it is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan. from the beginning it is obvious that jackie chan's stunt team literally risked their live to make this film. both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative. even today, no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts. many people were hospitalized in police story including jackie chan. the fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define jackie chan's use of props. throughout the film chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass. the action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and jackie chan's coordination is outstanding.the rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan. chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation. the plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times. while the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action. however, for the time period it was made in, the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining. there a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well.overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made. and even in hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored.

the best martial arts movie ever made. this one movie is better than anything bruce lee ever did. a classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax. jackie chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu.it's a great pity that whilst bruce lee had been so overrated, it took jackie chan an eternity to become popular in europe and america. jackie rules!!!!

jackie chan name is synonomus to stunts. this movie never let you down.the opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder ,if he knows the meaning of fear.this movie comes very close to jackie's best which is project a.but the main difference being that project a contains three stars where as in this movie jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders.this is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by bruce lee.the film has nice comic touches too. what makes this film work is jakie's ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero.this movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor.

this is jackie chan's best film, and my personal favourite. after the disappointing u.s made 'the protector' directed by james glickenhaus, jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong. this is also probably jackies most violent movie, with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts.the action is fast and furious, jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design. bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits.the script is a simple cops and robbers affair, nothing special, after all it was written around the action. i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing, but it shouldn't put you off too much.so, get the lads round, crack open the beers and enjoy. by the way, the film was nicknamed 'glass story' by the stunt crew. why? i'll let you find out for yourself!!

having first achieved fame with drunken master, jackie chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983's project a, a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re-established him as a major star. by the time police story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding jackie was reaching its zenith, and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts, brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy. it broke numerous box-office records and inspired a 50% rise in police recruits, but, viewed 20 years on - is it any good?as an action movie police story unquestionably stands up. there are several terrific fight scenes, some stuntwork that recalls the very best of chan's hero buster keaton, and a compelling if over-violent climactic tussle. jackie's performance is also very strong, and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film's impact just a little, his charisma carries it through. furthermore, in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger, jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed! by praising police story as a simple 'good vs. evil' battle critics belittled the film's ambiguity of tone, and whilst it's hardly the brothers karamazov, in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas.in short, this remains a quality "popcorn" movie* (though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film's final scene) - a potent, boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period.

this is one of jackies best films that is him without opera buddies sammo hung and yuen biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy

this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview, jackie said it was his favorite as well. it contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well. this movie was a favorite of brandon lee, who used parts in rapid fire, and was also lifted in tango and cash, which used some of the opening scenes.jackie plays a policeman in hong kong. the story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil ku (who is one of the greatest villains in any jackie chan movie.) you can expect some very funny scenes as jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend, played by maggie chung. his job is to protect ku's secretary who has enough information to take him down, but even that poses many problems. jackie is at his absolute best here. the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - period. it was the most intense fight i have ever seen jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights. all in all, one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands. he was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage.all in all, another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies. by the end of this movie, you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen. so many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore - jackie had to take responsibility himself. there are no gimmicks, wires or stand-ins - it is all true-life action that is a treat to watch. it is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now. if you have not seen this movie and are a fan of jackie chan or action in general, give yourself a treat and watch this movie. it is truly sensational.

this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. this is still the best action movie ever done. the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan. the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever. the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing. the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film. the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt.

police story is a stunning series of set pieces for jackie chan to show his unique talents and bravery. some of the stunts here are among jackie's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably jackie's greatest single fight sequence, more brutal and less comedic then say project a or drunken master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact.but unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements. i always prefer jc in films such as project a where his natural comic talents shine through. in the serious confines of some elements of police story it just doesn't work for me. having said that though this is still up there with jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle.as usual with hong kong films avoid the english dubbed dvd version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles.great stunts, ok movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a jc movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10

police story brought hong kong movies to modern day cinema.jackie plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys, and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend selina (brigitte lin).the movie features plenty of stunts, not only from jackie, but also from other actors (who are now in jackies stunt club).three of jackie's stunt members went to hospital during filming on the film.the movie also have some incredible fights scenes like ''the car park fight'' and ''the shoppingmal fight ranks as one of jackie's finest.the movie also won award for best movie and best action design by jackie chan at hong kong film awards.everyone who loves jackie chan and/or martial art movies shud see this

there is one detail, which is not very common for jackie chan movies, but which is present here. it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too. jackie is menacing and psychotic here. he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back (in a usual laid-back pattern), but he is the one who can go and start the tumult. his manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing. every time it goes "crack!". i also especially enjoy the scene when jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend. it's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen. besides, the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall (it also looks like a poster of "rabochiy" from our soviet era) and some lines in russian on the left (i noticed that quite accidentally). that looks terrific (and nostalgic for russian people). i also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies. here there's a lot of this stuff. it's quite amazing watching the characters falling/jumping/running/driving through all manner of panes.all three movies are great. i had been preparing myself to see the down-slide of the quality but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts (and not only jackie chan's character appears in all three movies - that's also excellent and keeps continuity up).i would like to describe each movie just in a few words: no.1 - great (in all aspects - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); no.2 - raging (jackie is really *beep* off here) and painful (jackie gets tortured); no.3 - unbelievable (the woman that fights alongside with jackie is incredible) and bombastic (should i mention a lot of guns and explosions?).as to the rest - much has been mentioned by the others.it's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again (at least by me). its place is in top 10 among action/comedy jewels. finally it's been released in russia on dvd (the 2nd film has the best options - the chinese/russian soundtracks and english/russian subtitles).solid 10 out of 10. thank you for attention.

this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time. porn is watched for the porn, jackie chan is watched for the action, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. sure the middle of the movie was boring, very boring, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. this did change the way how american action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. if you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan's, hes pure in everyway. he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park, and even in todays movies. american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece

this is not only one of the greatest jackie chan films, but also one of the greatest kung-fu movies of all time.we've come to expect crazy stunts, and fast, creative action in chan's movies, and this one set the benchmark for others to follow. it's two hours of pure entertainment, that impresses all the way through.as well as the superb action, we have a viable storyline and believable characters, with chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing, mixing eastern resolution methods (ie kicking ass).overall, it's funny, serious, entertaining and groundbreaking. a must for any kung-fu fan, whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community.

police story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself.compared to other action films,police story makes schwarzenegger and stallone look like beginners.the stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb.if new line cinema has any sense,they would release this in theaters.

my favorite jackie chan movie will always be "drunken master" (1978), followed by this film from 1985, "police story." in it, chan plays a hong kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (brigitte lin) so that she can turn state's evidence. as the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin, but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay. like "drunken master," "police story" has many of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that chan has become famous for, climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall. in his role as director, chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action. while light on the overall slapstick humor of "drunken master," at heart "police story" is just that, a police story, a gritty cop-thriller that would be oft-copied over the years to come.10/10

jackie chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and police story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late, great bruce lee. if enter the dragon bared the so-called bench mark of lee's greatness in the 70s, then the same can be said about police story and jackie chan in the 80s.forget about the rush hour trilogy, or any of his us efforts- the one film that really typifies chan's excellence, not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking, bone-crushing kung- fu talisman, as well as his movie career was this, police story- the first in a series of successful cop films, set in mainland, present day hong kong.i've seen many of his efforts- likewise the us-based rush hour, rumble in the bronx, the medalian and the tuxedo to name- and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to police story. in those movies, we saw a less 'dumbed down' version of jackie, of whom didn't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum, not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as drunken master, police story to name. the stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie. the shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed: the flying shards of glass, chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town, and chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with. considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm's way, jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one, is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert. especially as he has the bruises to show for it. thus, he has proved that he is no one-trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves.story-wise, there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative, it makes up with its end-to end action and fight sequences. as for the dialogue, well it's not a really huge aspect of the film- which is why most fans of jackie's and martial arts films are more interested in action, as opposed to the story.unlike say the matrix, there are no wires or cgi, or any form of computer trickery involved. what you see is what you get- and what you get with police story is a great jackie chan epic, full of action and pulsating stunts.it is miles better than rumble in the bronx, rush hour and all his other american efforts.police story is an excellent film and one i'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice jackie chan fan, but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first.

probably jackie chan's best film in the 1980s, and the one that put him on the map. the scale of this self-directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished. there are, clearly, differences between the original chinese and dubbed english versions, with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter. the latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their chinese originals. in fact, the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time, trials in colonial hong kong were conducted in english, while the original has this scene in cantonese!nonetheless, chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible, so non-cantonese audiences don't miss much. it's not, after all, the dialogue that makes a chan flick, but the action and the painful out-takes. the story is easy to follow: chan plays an incorruptible hong kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather (cho yeun), and assigned to protect a star witness (brigitte lin). the action is superb from beginning to end, and there's not much time to breathe in between. it'll never get you thinking, but what an entertaining, and well strung-together, film. arguably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there.

a winters day, 28th december 1986, two bored 14 year olds hire a movie. "hmmmm, police story, looks interesting", "who is this jackie chan?", "never heard of him". two hours later after watching the film, in a daze, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and severely out of pocket from collecting jc movies!) the film still grabs me like no other. ok, maybe i have a soft spot for it as it was my "first" (cannonball run doesn't count!!) jc movie, but it is an excellent movie. it has all the classic jc elements, action, humour, action, heart and action! some comments say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated! but then so must jaws, casablanca, singin' in the rain and the godfather!!!!!! without movies like police story where would hollywood action be today? ps set standards, many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies. to really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen, you miss so much of the movie otherwise (yes, he really does fall off the bus going round the corner!). if you haven't already, see this movie now!!!!

version: universal / hong kong legends r4 dvd release. cantonese / english subtitlesonce upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with 'the matrix', and i was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that 'terminator' was better than 'matrix'. i was but a simple teenage boy, looking for a good action movie, and then there was a shining light on a tv station i had never really watched, a little station known as sbs. one night i noticed in the tv guide that a movie starring jackie chan - 'police story' would be on later. being fifteen, and having only seen 'rumble in the bronx' and 'rush hour', i said... "wow awesome" and sat down to watch it, and continually shouted "wow awesome" as the movie progressed. two weeks later, after sbs had shown the 'police story' trilogy, i knew i had found my new favourite actor.jackie plays chan ka kui, a hong kong cop who busts a major drug-lord, chu (yuen chor). chu's secretary, selina fong (brigitte lin), is being held by the police as a witness against chu, and chan is assigned to protect her. things go bad - reaaaal bad - when chu's case is dismissed and he decides he wants fong and chan dead.'police story' is one of the greatest action movies ever, and certainly one of my favourite jackie chan films. it starts off strong, and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. everything in between is great. however, some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people...as a story, this is still one of jackie's better efforts. for an action movie, the story is pretty good, and jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting & plot intensive 'new police story'. this isn't 'miracles', but maybe that's a good thing.'police story' is one of jackie's finest works. it got me hooked on jackie chan movies, and should provide a nice start for any potential jackie fans. the bad news for anyone who sees this first is that jackie chan movies don't come much better - 10/10

as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 (mbb bo 105) flight scenes in this movie. one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod, in this case an inert rb 75 (maverick) missile painted black with the letters "ews 39" in white along the side. real jammer pods definitely do not look like that, at least not the ones i've seen.but apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending (the last minute). anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units, including the now-legendary ssg, on film should see this one.

i did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility. the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies. this may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future.

i think this movie is well done and realistic. i you are used to watching hollywood "action" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. this movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what hollywood can produce, and that is what lifts it above the average action movie. i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. but as i have seen the "making of" extra i'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch. high quality realistic story and movie.

this movie was made in hungary i think. anyway,the countryside is gorgeous,the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating. their horsemanship is awesome. i got more into the native people, the farm life, and how heroic they were trying to hide brady from the evil nazis who where looking for these parachutists. they even sacrificed their life in several instances. the young orphan lad that brady befriends was a sweet kid. you will marvel at the riding i think, and the action of trying to evade the nazis. it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. ladies have hankies handy, as you will be devastated at the end. i own it, and have watched it several times. in other words, not just a one time around flick. its a keeper....

this movie is why i found this website. i couldn't find this movie anywhere else! i am so glad we found it here! we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it. one other poster commented that it is was boring, though i must say that it is not. especially if you are a horse person, you will love this movie. the horses are awesome, well trained and the movie is well done. it is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home dvd library. we will be recommending it to our friends. the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times.

a beautiful movie, especially if you like horses,wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau.a story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training.i will buy this movie and watch it again. this is a family film and i recommend it highly.a good ''family nite'' movie. although there are some violent scenes, it was the nazi occupation of hungary.the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady.a hauntingly beautiful film.

sad story of a downed b-17 pilot. brady is shot down over occupied territory. the local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives. i had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours. after the film is over, i'm glad i took the time. it's an entire story told to explain the look on brady's face at the start of the film.

given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. it is plausible, realistic, and shows how the csikos (hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis. we are drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressionable, yet highly courageous boy--who admires the american pilot. if you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you. if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this movie. i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time.

really enjoyed this little movie. it's a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays miki is especially good). there's so many large scale impersonal films set around ww2, that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm, and an original one at that. i'll also add that this film is far from boring, very far!! of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. to anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family (i do), you'll find this film especially rewarding. recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different.

trapped: buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened, and is soon to close.we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow, that doesn't make sense. anyways, he's about to blow away one particularly big one, when he notices the resort is open. despite his best efforts, higher authority tells him his day is over.soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche hits.look, i'm not gonna reveal any more, all i can say is this was a b-movie designed for the family channel (which i just saw it on, and the fact it had no commercials proves it's a b-movie) anyways, it's a pretty decent film, but it's partially unreal.firsthand, when people are buried by ice and snow, they're buried. not just traced by powder. or, what about a cd for a screwdriver? it's not possible. and finally, what i can't stress enough, is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche, guaranteed.furthermore, it's worth a rental or a tv viewing, but not owning. 7/10.the movie is rated pg, but maybe it should have received something a little more strong. a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, dead people are laying around.enjoy.

the story deals about jet li who has to fight against his oldfriends.but there is one problem, the friends are superfighters. the film is filled with blood, super action and the best stunts forever. and lau ching-wan is a great co-actor. of course the movie has the typical hk-fun.but i love it! in germany "black mask" is uncut.

this is definitely one of jet's best efforts. few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can. the action is rapid-fire, and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. as a result, it may take americans a little off-guard. a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film. i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially fist of legend) making it into the us market. a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts.

i'm no big fan of martial arts movies, but the video shop was nearly empty and jet li was in lethal weapon 4 and i got it free when the other films i'd rented, either way i rented it. i absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old biochemistry and accountancy students) spent the half hour after the film making strange kung fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other. i can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila). i never enjoyed bruce lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, beating him, kicking bigger bloke etc film ends. think jackie chan with a little less comedy and more action.

once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask. in this film li plays tsui, an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him. to do this tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace. other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui, but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace. thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives. this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. the martial arts is amazing, but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences. if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts, then black mask is for you. i am glad to see that some of jet li's movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. this is one of li's best films, go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america.

i am a massive fan of jet li! he is the best hk action film star alive... and consequently - this film rocked! i saw it in the video store and, as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, i didnt register its presence at first, and had to look twice. i immediately knew what i would be renting out. my only qualm (i suppose i expected it) is that it was dubbed (aaargh) and not subtitled. elsewise, the movie's original/strange/cool plot, and full on action made it one of jet li's better movies... even though they all fall under that category....

i saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it. then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it. i am ready to watch it again.i am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian? the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites.of course the martial arts are stunning. there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style. however, if you are not... we paused playback briefly and walker, texas ranger was on. we noticed that after every strike there was a cut. not in black mask.

this movie is rich with action and gore. the story line is strong enough to support the action sequences. the english version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable. this movie ranks among my personal favorites next to "hard boiled" ...

hak hap(black mask)is what i'd like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. sure the plot has been tried and heard before, (a biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren't the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist, and a librarian. but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police -his best friend is a cop- he becomes the black mask.) the style that the movie goes for, very visual, works and at least for me is entertaining. i love martial arts movies that are a spectical. people flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop. but that is what this movie is about anyway right, a showcase of jet li doing what he does best, and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills, which to say the least are top notch. as with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala. jackie chan and sammo hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time, these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats. but i must say, even with the large holes left in the plot (like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape? who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment.......ohh well suspension of belief i guess) , the movie to me stays interesting. it is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter. but still all around a great high paced action movie.

now let me tell you about this movie, this movie is my favorite movie!!! this movie has excellent combat fighting. this movie does sound like a silly story line about how jet li plays a super hero, like spider-man, or etc. but once you've seen this movie, you would probably want to see it again and again. i rate this movie 10/10.

very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee .li is excellent as the low key librarian/cop who saves all time and time again . he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don't mess with .francoise yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage , she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that i found unforgettable .the villain , the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but i can't find his name in the credits , can some one help me out with that ? thanks ! enjoy hak hap or black mask , in any language its good entertainment !

ok, it's not a perfect movie by any means but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion that it's really really bad. i watched a lot of hong kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly. i never saw 'black mask' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time. apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my dvd copy didn't give me the option to turn off, the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated hong kong movies during this time. i still stick to my guns in the opinion that, when it comes to action, these guys, no matter what their budget, add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy, casino royale or mission impossible (i'm not knocking these movies - i just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated) will ever achieve. what is it? it's the feeling that the film-makers were experimenting as they shot and edited, not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time. for me, this makes watching movies, all the more fun and dangerous.

what more could i say? the americans totally hated it because the u.s. cut was so bad, although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it.talking about the u.s. theatrical release(along with the newly released blu-ray disc version), it's faster and tighter than hk cut, the background musics were all changed from the dark, grim hk musics to hip-hop musics; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out. though, the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone. but, the problem is hak hap(black mask) the movie was designed and meant to be dark, grim, super-disturbing and totally gruesome. very unfortunately the u.s. release just skimmed the cream they wanted, which in return completely changed the movie's undertone(hk release was rated 18+) to be even more comical and amateurish.now let's talk about the original hk release. this movie is like a hidden gem, a prototype for the whole "matrix" tide and era. the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit "old-school" among hk movies. however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture. with all the leather, black costumes and decorations, this movie features a batman-like superhero in a black mask against a run-of-the-mill gang of multinational super-soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss. yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child, but it works. it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats. in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg-13 rating, but without jet li and liu qing yun. and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship. and, did i happen to mention francois yip? her roundhouse kick was totally cool, even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting. did i mention she was also smoking hot? anyway, there are a lot of things to like about the movie.however, the movie also suffered from a lot of problems. first off, it's a mediocre script made at its best potential, which means this production team deserved a better screen-writer. there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far-fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences(us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut). anyway, you can't ask too much out of a comic-inspired action movie. also, this movie is entirely improper for children. i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old. it's saturated with disturbing contents including blood, gore, sado-maso costumes, extreme brutal violence and so on. along with the style of the movie, it can be called a wet dream for heavy-metal rock music fans and action fans. (the u.s. cut was milder, but if you want to see it, see the hk release for what it is.) 7/10. status: inspiring, hidden, undervalued, adult.

this film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire hollywood films of this sort. this film is produced by tsui hark and stars jet li. this team has brought you many worthy hong kong cinema productions, including the once upon a time in china series. the action was fast and furious with amazing wire work. i only saw the wires in two shots. aside from the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as filler. to find any other action films to rival this you must look for a hong kong cinema outlet in your area. they are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint.

this is a very strange hk film in many ways. first, many of the action sequences really aren't that much fun. the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly. not cool silly, or even funny silly, but just silly. that's not to say there aren't some great action scenes, but most simply don't come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen. the opposite side is that this film actually has characters, not just people. all of the main characters are interesting (except for the head bad guy, who is flat as a billiard table) and most are fairly well acted. all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch. the dialogue is quite witty, and doesn't seem to lose much in translation. this film is worth seeing, but i hope that uninitiated american audiences don't think this is the best hk has to offer.

in black mask, jet li plays a bio-engineered super-killer turned pacifist, who has to fight against other super-killers. bad plot, bad sfx(60 million dollar budget), but the fighting scenes were excellent! jet li is the greatest martial-arts star alive!

i can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the dynamo that is jet li. fist of legend would have been a much better choice. anyway, black mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix. but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (i'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and francoise yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.black mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. more focus on li's fantastic physical skills were in order. black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows li's skills.

this film appears to draw a borderline - on one side, those who love it, on the other, those who find it unbearable.to begin with, there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not "getting". of course jet li's mask looks like bruce lee's kato - he's supposed to, it's a joke. the guy who has a time-bomb sewn to his heart - outrageous? of course, it's a joke! some readers will probably ask, if this film is supposed to be so funny, why all the excessive and gory violence? well, for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; and while hong kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme, it's certainly only slightly more than average for a hk action film.also, black mask is really the kind of film that takes a genre's conventions and pushes them to extremes, simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic. after decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds, many people were horrified to see bonnie and clyde and the outlaws of the wild bunch spurting blood all over the place. but the fact is, when you're shot with rapid metal projectile, it's almost certain that blood will spurt, especially from an artery.this film is a chinese comic book movie. it is true that the spiderman films never get this gory - but if they were faithful to reality, they would be! well, despite its comic-book origins, this film is faithful to reality.the only complaint i have is the flashy, over-stylized filming and editing. if the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to hollywood-style nostalgia (as, e.g., the rocketeer, or the recent sky captain film), i doubt anyone would have found it offensive.but as it stands, i still had a lotta fun watching this movie.

anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie. the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping, who also did the fights in the matrix. and the fight scenes are somethin.li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain, who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian (ya got me). when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade, li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them.there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie (one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices). the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; the body count is way up there. li has seldom been better, and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars (yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier). anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no suprises there; he makes a cameo in every hk movie). it's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the us; i wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much. recommended.

the story would never win awards, but that's not what it's about... the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes. who needs a story with fighting like that? really, it's worth watching for that reason alone. if you can handle the gore, of which there is a lot... none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at. i gave it a 7.

i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds. but this movie i enjoyed, mostly because i'm used to the usual hk action films. most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line, watch it for the mindless action. and mindless action is right. you get to see jet li jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. it's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon 4. that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped. most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film. but you need to remember most hk film budgets aren't nearly as high as a north american film, and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them. if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing.my rating was an 8.

in stand by me, vern and teddy discuss who was tougher, superman or mighty mouse. my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too. sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix. but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan, bruce lee and jet li. it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead, but it is a fun one. and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask, you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan. in this film he comes across as a martial arts god.black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men, to be supreme fighting machines. their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. they are invincible in some ways. now that is the premise for the film, but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes.jet li is a marvel. he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do. and that is what makes watching him so fun.besides the martial arts in the film, black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co-star, the police officer. they are great together. but to be honest. if anyone is reading this review, they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department. and the answer to that is a resounding yes!!! lots and lots of gory mindless action. you will love this film.

i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users (some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever.' what?? haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave?) my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on. duh! what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie? did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story, then just loaded it up with action? of course not! black mask is awesome, wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time. it's also deliciously gruesome, and we get plenty of severed limbs, decapitations, and creative ways of watching the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people, too!) get slaughtered. most of li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to black mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence, bloodshed, or action sequences whatsoever! and that made me a happy camper. again: if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot, you are going for the wrong reasons. black mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though, beware of the horrendous dubbing).

well i gave this movie a 7. it was better than "thirdspace" but not as good as "in the beginning" as far as the b5 movies go. i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal. let's hope the producers and cast get the next series "crusade" up to the standards of b5.

an excellent film with great performances from zack & lochley. much to their displeasure (& mine) garibaldi arrived on station. (all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4 & 5 i lost sympathy for the character.) it doesn't take him long to start criticizing zack (who i love best of all on the show)and taking charge. i'm sure zack could have coped. the soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as zack does. the humour supplements it nicely. 10/10

i thought "the river of souls" was a very good babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances from martin sheen, tracy scoggins and ian macshane. if this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series.personally, i've always preferred scoggins to christian, although granted jms didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the byron/telepath plot. if you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid stuff. probably my third favourite of the four movies, but in no means bad at all.

let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice, i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie. those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears. i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors. the acting was better than average, but the plot held no surprises. they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation. now as to the historical errors, if you call them that, the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april, then capt. pike, jim kirk, etc.. according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that's the reason a prime directive was created) but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series. i hope the plots will get deeper, and then special effects can take a backseat.

i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember. when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excited.the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait. it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters. the nx-01, enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love.scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer. jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander t'pol. that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleet.enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching, and i recommend that. watch it.

this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series. it has a "down to earth"-kind of feel with darker and less "plaggy" scenography.the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential. one thing that is fairly disappointing (with all star trek series really) is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else. (earth has stopped war, famine etc) the female characters here are two, subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human. hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a "vulcan babe". some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american (as opposed to the more international feel of the tng-crew) but creates interesting dynamics. a very good pilot though for a very good series.

there is star trek canon -- lots of it. from canon we know the history of the future. advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc.enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon. an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. as one, i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there -- but no.the phase pistols, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in tos. an old style starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what i expected to see. also, i did not expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects. in the earliest view of tos (the original pilot: the cage), we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect -- a bit of old earth navy. with enterprise, we see a shocking disregard for rank. there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprise.it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe (quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal. unprofessional, unsure, more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series -- and that says a lot!the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel.enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic, bold, gritty, high-rick exploration of space.i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor. still, i liked the actors for the most part. linda park, an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college, is sure to develop nicely. the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created.enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series. let's hope for a good future!

enterprise is the entertainment, but it is also the forefront of science fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow. with gratitude and respect mr. berman and mr. braga. i wish you well, thank you both for your service to trek.enterprise is what trek is about...

call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series. if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series, you should definitely watch this one. perhaps more compelling than that of voyager's caretaker, which launched the series with cpt. janeway, archer's adventures are completely different, yet strangely familiar...the music is catchy too. no true sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthwhile.

this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered. not to slight ds9. that was a wonderful show in it's own right, however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted. enterprise is that show. while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways. it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again. and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members. viewers really cared deeply for the crew. enterprise has much promise in this area as well. the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising. while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical. i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television. also, we should note the performances, blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance. the rest of the cast delivered good performances also. my only gripes are as follows. the theme. it's good it's different, but a little to light hearted for my liking. we need something a little more grand. doesn't have to be orchestral. maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. and my one other complaint. they sell too many adds. they could fix this by selling less ads, or making all shows two parters. otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager.

the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek: a dose of realistic, flawed personalities. the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring, they were so noble as to be unbelievable. i also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans. its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs. it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two, though i don't think it would work in the time frame of the show. the only negatives that jumped out at me were the "quick cut off the ending at 2 hours" feel of the end, which is common among many of the trek shows. the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes. it was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin. but its not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well.lets see how the next episode does.

i don't think most of us would tend to apply the term "must-see" to action films, but i was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the "must-see" stamp from me.mandy played by shannon lee (daughter of the late and great bruce lee and sister of the late brandon lee) is recruited by martin, a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal syndicate, and get rewarded handsomely for it. little do they know that another pair of thieves (lucy and tommy, a pair of lovebirds), who were spurned earlier by mandy and martin to get in on the deal, are also planning to steal the diamond.how each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch. things go awry, as martin and mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind lucy and tommy.you'll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate, who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands.action fans will not be disappointed, as there's a healthy dose of gun battles, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat sequences.what is surprising is that, it's not just the action that carries this film, but the romance and laughs (and i don't mean your typical one-liners prevalent in action films) that sneak in.it's not easy to root for bad guys, but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop.a great film and one not to miss!9 out of 10

i've seen tons of hk actioners, and this one is right at the top of the genre. the action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. the kung fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics eye-popping, the stunt work heartstopping. the editing is perfectly paced, heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work. this film is directed by old pro corey yuen, whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre, including the jet li vehicle the legend of fong sai-yuk. if there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, though martin, the male lead, comes closest to it. this movie is full of archetypes rather than characters--the sexy killer, the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend, the cackling villains. that said, shannon lee has a terrific screen presence; she's great with the fighting, the stunts, and the guns. when she's onscreen it's hard to take your eyes off her. she's that good. why isn't this woman a major star?

this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies. asides from it's little plot, the weak drama and bits of comedy antics, the movie is action packed with gun-fighting and martial arts action. kept me entertained from beginning until the end. i thought shannon lee was awesome in the movie.having an action director like corey yuen is what keeps hong kong action going strong. this modern action film is highly recommended!!

shannon lee,the daughter of bruce lee,delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating hong kong movie and proves that like her late brother brandon she is a real chip off the old block. there is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of "and now,you're dead". when you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created.i genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut. bruce lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring shannon does not let the family name down here.although there are several pleasing performances in this movie (michel wong for one)it is shannon lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as mandy the hitgirl supreme.hell;you may well come away whistling her fights!

i, like many die-hard trekkers (or trekkies, i don't care!) suffered through seven seasons of "star trek voyager", dreaming of a better show when it was over, lamenting the end of "deep space nine" in 1999. prayers, answered. "enterprise" is fantastic. fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visuals, a pop-song for the intro. (i was shocked!) i can't think of anything i didn't like. sign me up for 10 seasons of this show. "star trek" is back - "voyager," nobody misses you! keep on trekkin'!>

i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet, i say potential.. we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas... but i hope not! for those that have not seen it..see it! without that annoying "prime directive" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool.. and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain, and the vulcan babe is hot too, (check out the decontamination scene)i gave this a full 10... it blows away all the other series openers.. i hope this goes longer than 7 years...

ok, so, this is coming a few weeks late, but it is here. mostly, this is because of statements of various negative natures. starting with the technology. when star trek: tos ran, special effect technology was extreamely low tec, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups. in the 35 years seince tos premiered, the crew of star trek have become experts at economy.ultimately, they have decided, quite rightly in my mind, to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all. so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii? as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire, it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200. nothing was firmly established.enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while. this is what voyager could have been. no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies, but be thankful that star trek has so few. so, quit gripping and enjoy.

after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb. next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek. this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show. the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts. scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before. the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season. when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed. in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of. pity a film or tv movie was never considered. so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell, including the onset of hostilities with the klingons..........

okay, the recent history of star trek has not been good. the next generation faded in its last few seasons, ds9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before, and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise. so, when they announced a new star trek series, i did not have high expectations. and, the first episode, broken bow, did have some problems. but, overall it was solid trek material and a good romp.i'll get the nits out of the way first. the opening theme is dull and i don't look forward to sitting through it regularly, but that's what remotes are for. what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. they need to cut that nonsense out.but, the plot was strong and moved along well. the characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous theme. i particularly liked the linguist, who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. they seemed to stay true to trek lore, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories. anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show up?all in all, the series has enormous potential. they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes. we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. how did the klingons go from just insulting to war? how did we meet the romulans? how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge. why is the prime directive so important? if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes, this will be an interesting series.my favorite line: zephram cochran saying "where no man has gone before" (not "no one")

a very good start. i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: it should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series. the cast is interesting, although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human. she needs to school on spock who, after all, is the model for this race. too bad they couldn't have picked jeri ryan. i like ms. park, the korean(?)lady. the doctor has possibilities. haven't sorted out the other males, except for the black guy. he's a really likeable. bakula needs to find his niche--in ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. he is, of course, big and strong enough for the heroics. the heavies were ok, although i didn't like their make-up.

a strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for "enterprise," the "prequel" to the original "star trek" series. it stumbles a few times into "trek" convention and cliché--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as "seven of vulcan"--but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well-drawn, and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways, than those of earlier (later?) series. scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players. the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in "star trek: the next generation," "deep space 9" and "voyager": instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift, it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which i hope happens, because after about a half-dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.

enterprise, the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'broken bow'. first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban (who are the main enemy in the first season of the show). from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is, with some of the best character development, story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time.the opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans, whom some believe that the song is out of place. what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves. if one listens to the actual song, instead of the theme, then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together. and eventually as the series progresses further and further, and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew, will the song actually become meaningful. overall diane warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson.what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered. enterprise is (in my opinion) one of the most well cast shows since the next generation. choosing scott bakula, as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean-luc picard. as the captain always leads the show, bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins. he simply is (both actor wise and character wise) a superb human being and his charm, wit, and compassion are overwhelming to watch. as for the other cast members, a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr. phlox. it's also nice to see a non-human playing a role, and the decision to give the captain a dog, named 'porthos' was a well-received idea. throughout the show character development was brilliant, it was fast, well timed and almost perfect. i say almost because sadly travis mayweather's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season. he does have some things to say here and there, but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important. jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t'pol. dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer. connor trinneer plays commander charles "trip" tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato, who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting. all of these characters make up enterprise, and all bring a quality that star trek hasn't seen in a long time. each person makes this show worth watching. smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx-01.the ship itself, the nx-01 is somewhat questionable in design. the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk. so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the akira class starship? continuity has been an issue in enterprise, but thankfully rick [berman] and brannon [braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them. continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details. if you see the show with and open mind, then you'll have no problems, but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time. so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself? according to them the nx-01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact. when zefram cochrane saw the enterprise-e through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker, it changed the ideas in his head. that's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on. of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer, some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer. come on guys grow up.when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway. and then they learned that, well maybe its not that bad after all. if you can't accept a quality show for what it is, not what it should be in your mind, then go elsewhere. or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do.the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine. they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military. perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise (aka flagship of the american fleet) like it so much. they are striking sets, and represent the show perfectly.rick berman 'the overlord of the empire' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have, and in all the right places. whether that be technicalities, visuals, sound, editing or score. enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be, when in the hands of geniuses. the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan, so should you.

a well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. pluses: the way the story moves - begins with soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he's there. the music. a disinterested look at the life of policemen. minuses: the violence and the gore, but i guess they add to the realistic effects. still, having people's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided.no complaints - 7/10

it has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick.i have watched this movie almost 10 times and it a great effort by gautham.from my perspective,i feel this movie is virtually flawless. surya as acp anbuchelvan-no doubt..classy.jyothika played her role as maya very well.the character suits her very well.the character that caught movie-goers attention was pandia.jeevan played the role of pandia very well.brutal and fearsome.jeevan deservedly received the best villain award in the itfa 2004.the supporting cast of daniel balaji,devadharshini and other performed well.racy screenplay,perfectly-timed dialogues and brilliant narration by gautham.the soundtrack by harris jeyaraj are all chart-busters while the bgm suits the movie very well.cinematography by r.d. rajasekhar is rich.peter hein choreographed the stunts well.anthony's editing is precise.above all,kaakha kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and romance.even some hollywood film cant compete with kaakha kaakha...undoubtedly.

indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the bad guys. the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end.this movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives. the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who. the music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as indian cinema goes.the movie is slow at times and the dilemma which anbu faces when it comes to maya is overplayed at times. but i would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit.

this one stood out for it's originality. i'm seriously tired of seeing hindi movies that are a hotch-potch of a whole bunch of hollywood and brit movies. some flaws were inevitable, nonetheless, this movie is a must-see. surya's portrayal of the clean-cut, conscientious cop (as opposed to the pot-bellied, money-hungry ones that we normally see) was awesome. he's come a long way from his work in nerukku ner. i liked the movie so much that i had to own it. i'm not usually into the mindless violence type of movies, somehow i actually felt for each character and therefore can't really bring myself to call it 'mindless' violence. i do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most hindi and tamil movies. i absolutely loved this movie for it's lack of the same. acp anbuselvan's reaction to loosing his wife, is not overdone, is heart-wrenching and makes me want to bawl my eyes out. there are certain times when i'm watching a movie when i want to hit the ff button. plenty of times i've wanted to do that at a cinema hall. never wanted to do so when watching this movie. i'm really hoping that ghajini releases soon.

well, would firstly like to clarify that kaakha kaakha is a part of a tamil prayer and roughly translated it means "to protect". khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform (which is khakhi!).also, the tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures , any rajnikanth or vijay movie would stand testament to that statement.now kaakha kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack. certainly very stunning in the final scene, especially love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). the gore is rather too much at times, but certainly this is a great movie!

in 2151, in broken bow, oklahoma, a farmer shoots the klingon klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the klingon is sent to the starfleet hospital. the vulcan ambassador soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of klaang to his warrior empire in planet kronos with honor. however, captain jonathan archer proposes to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back klaang alive to his home planet. jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr. phlox, who is treating klaang, to complete his crew, and the vulcan sub-commander t'pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise. when the equipment of the starship is shut-down, klaang is kidnapped by sulibans after a shooting in the hospital. after the autopsy of the suliban killed in the shooting, captain archer is informed by dr. phlox that the alien was actually a mutant, altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. t'pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x. they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier, bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronos.in spite of being a huge fan of star trek, i have not followed the episodes of "enterprise" on cable television. i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me. the adventure of the first enterprise, captain jonathan archer, the gorgeous t'pol, reed, mayweather, dr. phlox, hoshi and trip is excellent, at least in this pilot. i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually divides in two parts, but on dvd they are just one, therefore my review is valid for both. i did not like the music score theme, which i found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "broken bow"

when i heard patrick swayze was finally returning to his acting career with king solomon's mines i was very excited. i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure. what i got was a 4 hour long (with commercials) epic that was very slow. the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it. the ending was good (no spoilers here)but i was still left wanting more. well all a guy can do is prey that swayze does "roadhouse 2" so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous. until than if your a fan of king solomon's mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours.

i never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's. but after i saw on the internet that this was meant for the tv, i was shocked because for a television film, it is absolutely fantastic!the thing that mostly concerned me was the length. i felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary. also, it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end. on the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone. i just felt that patrik frayze looked a bit haggard. i also felt that gogool, who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes.i was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of africa. also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. still, its a great film for the television. 8 out of 10.

true, it does not follow the book very closely, but it's still a very entertaining take on the story. swayze was far better in the role than i expected. and doody avoided the "silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness" portrayal most of us probably expected (cf. kate capshaw in "indiana jones & the temple of doom").at any rate, it's amazingly better than richard chamberlain's awful pair of quatermain flicks.it is very reminiscent of a western in many ways. about the only thing i didn't care for was all the mysticism, but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre. like "how can you have an african adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen?" heh.

"broken bow" takes us back to where it all began. set 150 years in our future and 100 years before kirk, spock and mccoy. this installment of the "star trek" franchise, is in my opinion the first series since "tos" to recapture the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "going where no man has gone before". scott bakula is perfectly cast as jonathan archer, the first captain of the first "star ship enterprise". he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy. john billingsley is brilliant as the alien dr. phlox, and jolene blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical vulcan science officer t'pol. broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks, and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud.

i loved this movie. great storyline and actors and good movie sets. it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack. i can not find it anywhere. please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack. other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating. swayze did a great job. i think this is some of his best work. his past movies were ok, but this one really told a story for a change. this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired. congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work.

watched both parts twice. enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero. he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain. i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the "lady in distress". alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. she didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's. the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. age is inevitable, but let's not hide from it. a man at 50+ can be much sexier (and , patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth, no matter how pretty. hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile.

i thought king solomon's mines was beautifully done. my only reservation was alison doody. her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period, and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors. i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain. it was nice seeing a seasoned, rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired, fair skinned actors like val kilmer, brad pitt, etc. he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie. this version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with stewart grainger. it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie. i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated. i am looking forward to seeing this once more, and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles.

the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain (or at least is an alan quartermain type of character), that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply. what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain, in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga (with a touch of austin powers-esquire cheese here and there). it was labeled by many critics to have been a "great parody," or "unintentional comedy." unintentional is the word. this movie was never intended to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. unfortunately, it's witless rather than witty.with this new m4tv mini-series, you get much more story, character development of your lead, solid portrayals, and a fine, even, entertaining blend. this story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy. while it features both action and eye candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq, making for a fine, well - thought - out plot, and some nice complementing sub-plots. now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is indiana jones. nor is it a poor attempt to be so. this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aq/ksm saga. filmed on location in south africa, the audience is granted beautiful (if desolate) vistas, sa aboriginal cultures, and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here.steve boyum totally surprised me with this one, as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision. in fact, i have disliked most of his work as a director, until this attempt. i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be. this version rates a 9.8/10 on the "tv" scale from...the fiend :.

if you a purist, don't waste your time - otherwise, hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure. i loved the stewart granger/deborah kerr version - i've seen it dozens of times, but this film is every bit as good, only different. i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film. also, it is a pleasure to see alison doody again (i'm a huge indiana jones fan), patrick swayze is good as quatermain, and the supporting cast is superb. i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception. the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. if you are looking for entertainment, you won't be disappointed.

king's solomon's mines brings us patrick swayze (playing allan quatermain)who has spent a lot of time in africa, but decides it is time to return to england and be a father to his son. he finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit. in comes alison deedy (playing elizabeth) whose father is in africa and being held by an african tribe for ransom of the map elizabeth's father had sent her. elizabeth seeks out quatermain to take her back to africa to find her father.there is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with quatermain and elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (russians) who want the map also.the movie holds your attention until the end. patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged silent good man, anger and strength; in king solomon's minds his character actually smiles a few times. i would really like to see patrick swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again, one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong. maybe a little dancing would help. but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it.

this is a sprawling (4 hours) remake of the rider haggard story, with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with russian soldiers seeking a "stone of power" buried along with the treasure of king solomon. it's very well shot, giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of africa, and very well acted. patrick swayze is an excellent alan quatermain, and allison doody is attractive as elizabeth maitland, who hires quatermain to help rescue her father. sidede onyulo as umbopa, gavin hood as mcnabb and the leader of the russian soldiers (not named in imdb's listing) are also memorable. for all that hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it, this one is well told and, except that it's too long, i enjoyed it. 6/10.

the next-to-last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting, sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season; though flawed, 'all our yesterdays' has its moments and overall a moody, compelling feel to it. kirk, spock, and mccoy beam down to a planet, assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there, since the planet's sun is due to explode within hours. but as it turns out, the people there are all too aware of the planet's fate, and using a kind of time travel device, have escaped into the past. each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a 'library,' run by an elderly man named mr. atoz. atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well, and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers. there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode, with lines like:mccoy- where did they go? atoz- wherever they wanted to.the misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily, but for plot purposes, it isn't, and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th century england, while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age, 5000 years in the planet's past. from here, the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment. spock begins acting increasingly emotional, showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for zarabeth, the woman. he eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on vulcan, 5000 years ago. kirk makes his way back to the library first, and finally convinces mr. atoz they don't belong in his planet's history. spock and mccoy return just before it's too late, leaving zarabeth behind; the enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes, destroying the planet. the interaction between spock and zarabeth provides this episode's most memorable moments, though kirk's adventure into the 'english' past is amusing. all in all, a very decent latter-day star trek outing.

there's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. from the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. kirk, spock and mccoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.the librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england, while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. the intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by mariette hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age, and ian wolfe as the urbane librarian. somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode city on the edge of forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. this has to be one of the best of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.

this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek. there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool. first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode. they meet a freaky librarian type dude (very well played). then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth. mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy.spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves. you can literally taste the sadness at the end. leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching. spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human. albeit, in a not so nice neighborhood!anyway, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode....a love story, the salem witch trials, spock as a human, the desperation of being left in total isolation...abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film. this one is a classic, don't miss it....i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans!!!!!!

dr. mccoy and mr. spock find themselves trapped in a planet's past ice age, while capt. kirk is in the same planet's colonial period. however, it's the former pair that has the most trying time. besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary to be found only in caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy zarabeth (mariette hartley). as spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction to zarabeth and throwing "caution to the wind" about ever leaving this place. only with dr. mccoy's constant "reminders" does spock hold on to some grasp of reality.this stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some "emotion" and nimoy (spock) plays it to the hilt, coming close to knocking the bejesus out of deforest kelly (mccoy). surprising to previous installment, captain kirk (william shatner) wasn't allowed to get the girl, another plus for this one.perennial "old man" ian wolfe assays the role of "mr. atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past.

kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. they intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr. atoz who operates some sort of high-tech library. despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly 'make a selection while there is still time'. they have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror-like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past. then, while a disk is in the viewer, kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis xiv (the 1660s). when mccoy and spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository.while kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, spock and mccoy's is much more eventful, as spock falls head over heels for mariette hartley--who was sent to this awful place as a punishment. the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy.spock's departure from the norm, the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode--one well worth seeing.fyi--ian wolfe, the excellent character actor, played mr. atoz. i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969. interestingly enough, despite looking ancient, he lived on another 23 years--dying at over 95 years of age!!

the penultimate episode of star trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season. essentially, spock, mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr. atoz, the librarian. all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidon's past. spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the 'city on the edge of forever'--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidon's present. in the end, all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova. the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes.ironically, as william shatner notes in his book "star trek memories," this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisette's script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way. nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer, fred freiberger, that vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love. (p.272) however, freiberger reasoned, the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state. this was a great example of improvisation on freiberger's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode. while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in "plato's stepchildren," play music with hippies in "the way to eden" or sometimes display emotion, the script here was more believable. spock's acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner. (p.272) the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time, mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state, not just spock. but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows, the brilliant spock/mccoy performance and the originality of this script. who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past? this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'classic trek'--a genuinely inspired story. shatner, in 'memories', named some of his best "unusual and high quality shows" of season 3 as the enterprise incident, day of the dove, is there in truth no beauty, the tholian web, and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome. (p.273) while my personal opinion is that 'and the children shall lead' is a very poor episode while 'is there in truth no beauty' is problematic, "all our yesterdays" certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films. i give a 9 out of 10 for 'all our yesterdays.'

an unusual take on time travel: instead of traveling to earth's past, the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet. they beam down to this planet, whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours (that's cutting it close!). in some kind of futuristic library, they meet mr. atoz (a to z, get it? ha-ha) and his duplicates. it turns out, instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel, the usual way, the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras. mr. atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection (check out the discs we see here, another trek prognostication of cds and dvds!). when mr. atoz prepares the machine (the atavachron-what-sis), gallant kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of earth's 17th century, where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery. there's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time, using phrasing of the time ("...you're a bully fine coo.. witch! witch! they'll burn ye...!"). spock & mccoy follow kirk, but end up in an ice age, 5000 years earlier.kirk manages to get back to the library first. the real story here is spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors, the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago. this doesn't really make sense, except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change (even so, spock & mccoy weren't 'prepared' by atoz - oh, well; it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away, instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical vulcan). in any case, spock really shows his nasty side here - forget "day of the dove" and remember "this side of paradise" - mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged. spock also gets it on with zarabeth, a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment (a couple of trek novels were written about spock's son, the result of this union). all these scenes are eye-openers, a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in. it's also ironic that, only a few episodes earlier ("requiem for methuselah"), mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens. kirk, meanwhile, tussles with the elderly atoz, who insists that kirk head back to some past era ("you are evidently a suicidal maniac" - great stuff from actor wolfe, last seen in "bread and circuses"). it all works out in the end, but, like i mentioned earlier, they cut it very close. a neat little trek adventure, with a definite cosmic slant.

another woo's masterpiece!this is a best wuxie film i'm ever seen! woo - rulez forever (except some hollywood moments...). john woo - greater director of the century.maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of big directors... but he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free-mind people! his movies like the great poetry! woo is a movie sheakspeare! woo is a movie biron! woo is a mozart of bloodshet!!!!imho violent in woo films is not a directors bloodlust, but a instrument of art. themes of woo movies is more humanistic that more of the new films.

the pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes - absolutely incredible sword-moves and martial art show off. a true john woo masterpiece. the story tends to be a bit week though, but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action. if you are into martial art movies, you are going to love this one!

scott is right. the best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie. the sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good. however, the fight in the middle is the best even compared to japanese samurai movies. chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the japanese in terms of entertainment value. especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies, japanese movies excel, example being the lone wolf and cub series. even though duels in japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most, the sheer intensity of those moments made them better. but, this is one example where chinese swordplay surpasses the japanese. the scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever. the other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene. if you haven't seen it, you have to. john woo is the man.

i am a kung fu fan, but not a woo fan. i have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. now, martial arts; *that's* beautiful! and john woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing is possible! this is good stuff.many of the fight scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are amusing and likable. the bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. you gotta see the sleeping wizard!! he can only fight when he's asleep - it's hysterical!upon repeated viewings, however, last hurrah for chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. hence, i rate it "only" a 7 out of 10. but it really is almost an "8".all in all one of the better kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. all the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair).

the sword fighting was out of this world, the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques (until the end) that are way too common today. the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie. the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were cliché but the movie is comfortable with it. an injection of humour from woo.the plot with it's twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on. a good sense of suspense and well timed surprises. the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung-fu flicks don't.

this is one of my favourite martial arts movies from hong kong. it is one of john woo's earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts movies he directed. you can see his influences from working under chang cheh in this film. the action is good, the fight choreography is conducted by fong hak on who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie. it stars wei pei of "five venoms" fame and a whole host of faces familiar to fans of golden harvest and shaw brothers productions. the story line is interesting, there are a few decent plot twists and the build up of the characters and their relationships with each other is cleverly done. this film has only had a vhs release in the uk. media asia have released a region 3 dvd and there are versions of it on dvd available from the usa. the film is lovely to watch in either it's original language or in it's english dubbed version. i highly recommend this movie.

as a lover of bad movies, i definitely hit paydirt with this one. the plot isn't really that bad, but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself "what the heck is going on here?"there are many many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever. first off, rudy ray moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double time. there are also scenes where there is a slow-motion instant replay, jumping onto a ten foot high wall (by playing falling off of it backwards), naked men walking out of huge letters, and sex that literally brings down the roof (with the cable holding up the roof catching on fire).of course, no rudy ray moore movie would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene where rudy makes fun of all the customers, interposed with people doing some odd dance. there are so many things bad about this movie, but they're bad in an entertaining way, and if you take your eyes off the movie, you might miss another mistake.rating: 1/10 for actual value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for picking out mistakes and goofs, averages out to 7/10.

human tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than it's predecessor. the director knew what he had to work with and catered towards rudy ray moore's limitations as an actor. it's a fun movie that's more technically sound and acted. the performers don't take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow. rudy ray moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in dolemite.i enjoyed the film very much and i highly recommend it. just like his first film, it's catered towards a certain audience (i highly doubt that mr. moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career). check it out!highjly recommended.

this movie completely ran laps around the original dolemite. it had everything that makes a movie great..except for real actors. (ernie hudson couldn't do it alone and you know that! lol) i admit that i have killed my first video tape of this movie and i plan to buy the dvd version again as soon as possible! this movie has so many catchy lines it's pitiful! i am embarrassed to say that i know the theme song backwards and forwards! i love jimmy lynch's character to death, and he should have won the best supporting actor award in blaxploitation, but the oscars were never ready for this! this is a random film consisting of crooked cops, breasts, chases, bad editing, and of course martial arts. (being that it's the 70's and i can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts). i think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters!

what can be said about mr. moore? he's the godfather of rap, he's the king of the z-level blaxploitation flicks, and here, he is back as his most famous character, dolemite! can you dig it? this movie is one whacked-out roller-coaster ride of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence, and a whole lot of other stuff you'd never find in most modern movies (or any movies, really, haha!). the stand-up routine he gives early on is not to be missed! at any rate, d2 is definitely an entertaining way to waste an hour or so. dolemite: "he think he's bad and ain't got no class! i'm gon' rock this shotgun up his *beep* a**!"

not only is this a great african-american classic comedy, but one of many great american cult classics.i have recently purchased the collection edition of rudy ray moore.if you love the old school karate movies and black comedies, this is for you! they don't make movies like these anymore. my entire family are movie buffs, so this site is an extreme help on solving many debates. i am deployed in iraq right now. this helps me to stay connected to world that i know in the states. thank you imdb.i recommend this site to all my friends. dolemite rules! don't just take my word for it, check them out for yourself. ten lines is a lot for commenting on one movie i think, but if it gets the point across, i'm all for it!

rudy does it again with this hot off the streets follow up to dolemite. this entry is filled with the requisite rudy ray moore raunch, humor and martial arts. rudy eludes a crazy red-neck sheriff in this movie that also features an infamous scene where rudy dives down a steep hill. see it for laughs and for a brain-blasting hit of blaxploitation magic.

the human tornado is a campy 70's blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian rudy ray moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date. the movie tells the tale of dolemite, a bad ass pimpin' hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife. dolemite barely escapes, and journeys to sunny california to visit an old friend, a nightclub owner (and madam to dolemite's 'ladies') named queen bee. however, it seems that a rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket, so dolemite takes matters into his own hands. rudy ray moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film, including strong dramatic skills, a mastery of kung fu, an impressive singing voice (he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack), a touching, compassionate side with the ladies, and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing. this film has it all, people: a deep plot, blistering action, laugh-a-minute comedy, beautiful women in distress, a slam-bang ending...what more could you ask from a movie? run, don't walk, to your local video store and rent the human tornado today. and be sure to share it with your family.

i can still remember first seeing this on tv. i couldn't believe tvnz let it on! i had to own it! a lot of the humor will be lost on non-nz'ers, but give it a go! since finishing the back of the y series matt and chris have gone on to bigger and better(?) things. nz's greatest dare-devil stuntman, randy campbell has often appeared on the british tv series balls of steel. yes, he still f^@ks up all his stunts because he is too drunk.also the 'house band' deja voodoo have since released 2 albums, brown sabbath and back in brown. the band consists of members of the back of the y team and singles such as 'i would give you one of my beers (but i've only got 6)' and 'you weren't even born in the 80's' continue their humor.the south-by-southwest film festival also featured their feature length film 'the devil made me do it' which will be released early 2008 in nz.all up, if you don't find these guys funny then you can just f%^k off!!

this film was great.the plot was preposterous.the action sequences contrived.but, provided you can lighten up enough to laugh, it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone ranger.the baddies were more silly than bad. the good guys weren't too good. the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes.the inclusion of a baby added a good touch. sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise. i have to disagree about the acting. it was, on the whole, very good. i really wanted to punch judge reinhold.and, after all, isn't that the mark of a really good movie, wanting to punch judge reinhold?

i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies/language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part =d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas/coffee/phone/play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid -_- i think i'm done never mind i'm still not done what is this a joke? why do we have to go all the way to line ten... really what's the point of it??!! i will just right random words for now -_- maple story is fun i love my friends

just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour. i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end. there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone. it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don't suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error. the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet (hood) and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on. it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge wasn't going to be lowered and then it was. i'm afraid i did burst into tears so it wasn't that bad!!!!

in light of bad reviews - or car crashes - i feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due, and do a service. i'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad, almost automatically.it's rare for a movie to have suspense. this movie maintained suspense it's whole length, for me, despite any flaws that may be. how many films can say that? not even many big ones. because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life-threatening situation, which lasts the whole movie. yeh, the suspension was tight, and over some bumps the shocks did their work. it's not just a tv movie, but an all-action movie; there is no point where it stops, or deviates, or becomes talky. it would be hard to make a film like this, always on the road. only duel, or speed, are this that i recall. the best thing in them also was the constant tension.acting is not bad: the judge is as good as ever, and the others are. script is good. but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be - or seem to be - a little awry. what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. your first judgments are not always right, but i think the lead actor's was right in being in this movie.stunts are mostly terrific, especially for a tv movie. their only failing may be the noticeable, and again, apparent, slow speed. but we all know how deceivingly slow grand prix cars can look.i liked that the beginning said, "inspired by a true story." so you are not going to go how much is true? you know just the basis is. the usual "based on a true story" makes me think it should mostly be true. but maybe that's my error.how to save them: good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up. just a few inches would do. a stunt driver could do that at 100 mph. odd that they didn't call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic - to see if there's a way.i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster. or at least neutral. and help it become a runaway success.pic quality is a little soft for a dvd.spoiler: they would have been winched out after the baby was, but strangely that life-saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out. i guess we know why. end of movie. suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby.

how this has not become a cult film i do not know. i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy!"runaway car" attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good god it's bad), the storyline, the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh. and laugh you will. films are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth. this film is the pinnacle in entertainment, i laughed from beginning to end. at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked, it really is that funny at some points. when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces, i was laughing hysterically. but when the baby starting swinging around in the air, nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree, tears were running down my face.it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna's "like a prayer" video. he seems to get everywhere.

look, although we don't like to admit it, we've all have to suppress our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie. you know: you get into your car and you immediately start thinking,"gosh, i hope today isn't the day that my accelerator sticks at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph, all four door latches break in the locked position, both my main and emergency brake fail, my ignition switch can't be turned off, and i've got a full tank of gas; all simultaneously." fortunately, for most of us, our thorazine kicks-in before we actually decide that it's a bad idea to be driving a car. not so for the makers of the harrowing, white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat (if only in preparation to leave the room) action juggernaut, "runaway car" but they go ahead and drive anyway!i am endlessly pleased to have found (thanks to the imdb) that this movie is real, and that i didn't merely dream it.this movie is, at the very least, one of the fantastic sights you will see on your journey to find the el dorado of very bad cinema.i highly recommend it.

another excellent arnold movie. this futuristic movie has great action in it, and is one of arnie's best movies. arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death. this movie is excellent and a great sci-fi / action movie. i've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! perfection

the running man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks.in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary, post 1980s-boom. forget that though! there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film.schwarzenegger is on top form as ben "the butcher of bakersfield" richards, and the inclusion of bond-belting one liners was completely inspired-thety are truly leg-end-dary (with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight).the design of the stalkers is authentically american, and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc 'gladiators' tv show, and the wwe as well. buzz-saw's grisly end will chill any viewer to the core (as a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour?)jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle (and are arnies buds in real life), and its even got mick fleetwood in it too! what more could you ask for?i highly recommend the running man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action, with a glossty finish and some great characters. just don't expect an education from it (at least on surface value).quality, i bloody love it actually. you will too unless you're a thesp. 7/10

i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn't know about this website and i didn't realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show. for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can't tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt. the episode where starsky (kill starsky) almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show. what to you expect of a kid at age 12. now, i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i'm so there!!!!!!!! just got to say happy birthday paul!!!!!

although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my dvd rack and i don't know why. i think i like it because the moral of the story is 'television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life'. for those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book, its nothing like the film at all. to ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building, killing himself, everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time. i read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9/11.

this is an arnold movie. now that you know that, i've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review. if you don't like arnold, then you wont like this movie. if the case is the other, then you will very probably like it. it's as simple as that.now, if you're still reading this i expect you like arnold. good for you! he is quite good isn't he. the running man is a very typical arnold feature. it's got the usual retro-future we know so well from 80's b-sci fi, it's got a bunch of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending.in this case, the evil opponent is the all-controlling 1984ish government, which uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows. arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down, with a little help from his two confederates and the good-looking amber.it's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it. it's hopelessly 80's, but i find that charming. acting is varying, arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing, with a helping of stone-faced one-liners. heroine amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named damen killian is a typical evil tv man.in spite of all it's flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. it also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience. this does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming.if you've seen arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one. enjoy.

set in 2017 (although one might easily mistake it for 1987, judging by the hairstyles and clothing), the running man sees all-round good guy ben richards (schwarzeneggar) framed for a crime he didn't commit. after a daring prison break, he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal tv game show the running man, along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female, amber (maria conchita alonso),.used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses, the show pits convicts against a range of colourful (and often quite camp) opponents, each having his own unique killing style: dynamo fires electricity from a special suit, buzzsaw uses chainsaws, sub zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick, and fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders. but these killers are no match for ben richards, who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner (followed by the obligatory witticism).towards the end of the movie, ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host, killian.twenty years ago, arnold schwarzeneggar ruled the action-movie universe and, to his legion of fans, he could do no wrong. the austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies: comic book violence plus logic-free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one-liners, minus acting ability equalled massive profits. the running man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a t and arnie's (mostly male teenage) audience lapped it up (myself included).now, two decades later, and having just finished re-watching the movie for the first time in years, i find it a strange movie: one totally devoid of technical merit, decent acting, and convincing effects, yet somehow totally entertaining. directed by paul michael glaser (best known as det. dave starsky from cult 70s cop show, starsky and hutch), and adapted from a short story by stephen king (writing under the nom de plume, richard bachman), the running man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated, yet despite (or maybe because of) the film's shoddiness, it has a special charm which is hard to describe.with no attempt at creating a realistic near-future setting, the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles. check out the scene in which ben discovers amber's secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes(!); marvel at the crap 'futuristic' graphics used on advertising billboards and the running man board game (as a graphic designer, i found these particularly amusing); be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements.the running man may be utter rubbish, but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that i have no hesitation in recommending to fans of arnie and sci-fi action in general.

why didn't dynamo have any pants?! where did they go?? it was never explained. that's why this movie was so awesome. plus starsky gave his kids the aids!!!! great acting too. richard dawson deserved to win best supporting actor! a i d s my favorite line from the movie was "that hit the spot" a i d s. this movie was for the "birds". i tried to give this movie the "stinkeye" but it continued playing. what am i doing wrong???!!!! i thought the "hateboat" was funnnny lol ;) i would like that for a show. why wasn't dynamo wearing pants. i know his arm was skewered but... what's up with those crazy futur nets. why didn't that family feud guy ray combs get a net?? he could have used one. aidsssss

running man viciously lampoons the modern-day american media complex, and hits its target dead-center. it may be an easy target, but they pull it off none the less. rm effortless takes on pro-wrestling (featuring some pro wrestlers as the hunters), network television, the nielsen ratings, the american government (suggesting it's entertainment-oriented anyway), crime & punishment, and a half-dozen other things along the way. it's a far cry from the original stephen king novella, and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either. but who cares? it's basically a arnie flick, with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-liners such an undertaking requires.

running man isn't a great movie, in fact it's kinda silly. but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment. i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture, it's so silly and over the top, that it almost makes fun of itself. by the way, this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there.

this comic book style film is funny, has nicely paced action and a great futuristic style to it. writer steven de souza, who also wrote commando, gives arnie plenty of lines to dish out: "send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a pen into the lawyers back; "what a pain in the neck," after strangling subzero with barbed wire; "he had to split," after slicing his body between his legs; and finally, as killian slams through a billboard bearing his own face, arnie concludes, "now that hit the spot." funnily enough, bears some similarities total recall, another sci-fi flick starring schwarzenegger.

this is one of the great movies of the 80s in my collection that i think about all the time. the running man is one of arnold`s best and most different films even to this day and when i first saw the running man i was so excited to see a movie like this. i just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie. it also has jesse ventura, the legendary professor toru tanaka, sven-ole thorsen, the beautiful maria conchita alonso, yaphet kotto, kurt fuller, richard dawson, and thomas rosales jr. who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as universal solder, the lost world, robo cop 2, predator 2, and among others. all arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed, star filled, and its one its one of arnold`s best to date!

didn't mystic pizza win the oscar for that year? this movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why i felt that way upon leaving the theater. only "wargames" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling i was getting a glimpse of our future. history has shown that this is exactly what happened.the casting is a pop-culture cuisinart of the 1980s: you get arnold as ben richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to "run" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; richard dawson as damon killian, treating his role as if he were the host of family feud with the contestants using real guns; jesse ventura as "captain freedom" and co-wrestler professor tanaka as "subzero," both "stalkers" who kill the "running men." even mick fleetwood (mic) and dweezil zappa (stevie) show up, while the "dancers of the future" are none other than the laker girls. this movie screams "80s." the plot is a good excuse for the action: ben richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the running man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as "contestants." maria conchita alonzo as amber mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge salma hayek in the 1990s.the production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. i remember thinking when i was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? if the running man were listed in tv guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. the government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down american public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for "national security" is downright chilling. ben richards is played brilliantly by arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of america is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.the movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with back to the future iii, the "ravine" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. it is tragic that, as with wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. "serious" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their "common man" counterparts, such as this one.an absolute must-see.

amongst the standard one liner type action films, where acting and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. if the person in charge of casting were to have put "good" actors in this flick, it would have been worse(excepting richard dawson who actually did act well, if you can call playing yourself "acting"). i love this movie! the running man is in all likelihood god's gift to man(okay maybe just men). definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line: "it's all part of life's rich pattern brenda, and you better f*****g get used to it." ahh, more people have been called "brenda" for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine.

if you were brought up on a diet of gameshows you'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix. well, in the world of the running man, your needs will be sated. for in this game show, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate prize - their very lives.i loved this film. it was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis. it isn't one of schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it is a very good film. the underlying idea that television corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very believable, and is very well portrayed in this film. of course there are the usual arnie one-liners, my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the gameshow host asks "any last words?" arnie says: "yeah, i'll be back" but the host quips "only in a re-run" and presses the eject button. i give this film a 10 for sheer originality. i must have watched it 30 or more times. the only film apart from the die hard series that i watched this often!!in short, do not for a minute think that you own the t.v. - it owns you.....

the running man, along with total recall, is my favorite schwarzenegger movie. no, this isn't 2001, but it's not meant to be. and the acting and script here isn't even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator. but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. a state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are equipped with none) in order to satisfy the public's lust for sport and blood. the ultimate prize for a winning runner: freedom. or so the rules claim.for a movie with such over-the-top gory death scenes and cheesy one-liners, it really does have a lot to say. someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culture/government presented in this movie, so i won't go into it here. suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie, you will enjoy it very much (especially if you're a big sf fan with a lot of imagination). like i said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shoot-em-up flick. the premise is borrowed from a richard bachman (aka stephen king) short novel, but diverges fairly strongly from its source material, especially towards the end. (the book ends rather nihilistically; needless to say this movie doesn't.) i enjoyed both, but i like the movie better.my favorite line: "guess it's caused from steroids."

this is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring arnold schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including the television networks. one of their most popular tv shows is "the running man", where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. it's set up like a game show, where the audience votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky "contestants". audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. and the host is played by none other than family feud's richard dawson, who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. when ben richards (arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game.this movie is chock full of classic arnold one-liners, such as his famous "i'll be back" right before he enters the arena. and he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "how about a light?" i could go on and on, but i don't want to spoil the movie. it's funny stuff!whether it was intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "reality tv" craze. already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are televised for their "entertainment value". running man demonstrates what would happen if reality tv hit rock bottom, and it is a scary picture. one can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far.overall, this is a fun film & i highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!

arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives. but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play! the movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen, controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state. it's most popular game show is the running man, in which criminals are forced to survive against "stalkers" that live to kill them.the movie opens with ben richards (arnold) leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress. he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them, refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison, in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help. the government blames richards for the massacre earning him the name "butcher of bakersfield". eighteen months later richards along with two friends william laughlin (koto) and harold weiss (mcintyre) breakout of a detention zone they worked in. they make their way to the underground, led by mic (mick fleetwood). mic quickly identifies richards as the "butcher of bakersfield" and refuses to help him, but his friend's convince him otherwise. they want him to join the resistance, but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job. soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name amber mendez (alonso) has taken his apartment. knowing who he is she won't help him, but he convinces her, but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out.meantime, the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill. damon killian (dawson) the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture. richards refuses to play, killian threatens to use his friends instead of him, so he signs the contract. you'll love that part. but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure killian knows he'll be back. the runners begin to make there way through the zones and fight characters that are memorable, sub-zero, buzz saw and many others. eventually richards is joined by amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too. together they find the underground and make there way back to killian and give him a farewell send off.the running man is another one of arnold's great movies from the 80's. the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen king's book of the same name. some have said that the book is better. i'm sure it's not and i don't care anyway i loved the movie. as in all of arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even ventura gets a couple in. but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film. being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded. the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you. keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows, "hate boat" among others. also the cast was great besides arnold, koto, and alonzo don't forget professor toru tanaka, jim brown, ventura and sven-ole! with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now, but i'm sure the hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the "evil bush". the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one. some how the aclu managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things. blasphemy! overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him ,you can't miss this. its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day. the futuristic world and humor are great. overall 10 out 10 stars, definitely one of his best.

the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger films.but, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality tv. it is quite different to the stephen king book, true, but i doubt whether hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form.but, on with the review.ben richards (arnold schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. the economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like jumping for dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is the running man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian (played by the entertaining richard dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.some, however, try and speak up against the government. when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield, california, a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. when richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. he is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (yaphet kotto) and goes on the run.however, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez (marita conchita alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on the running man.and there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode. richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of los angeles (why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. amber also becomes curious about richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed. guess what happens to her, then? so, as amber, richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop. he's super arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accent.yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's arnie fun. there's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('he had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. it's a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.if you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed. but if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it. but the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.if you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv. it's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv. we've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. it seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.with that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...

i'm sitting here nov 2006 and i still can't help rave about this movie. arnold's best movies came in about a 4-5 year span. running man, predator, and total recall (1990). all 3 are amazing. the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall. they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017, but you can't help but snicker at the 80's style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv's. also the computer graphics of the "the running man" game show intro would not look like that in 2017. nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic. not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today's movie's. i really think that arnold's acting is much better than he's given credit for. now i would not have elected him governor but that's california for you. buzzsaw, dynamo, fireball, subzero are fantastic "stalkers" as well and i find the producers don't try to overkill the fight scenes. when the stalker is dead...he's dead. it doesn't go on for 20 minutes each. the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don't try and overplay it. i give this movie a 10/10 and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy a lot of movies these days. if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary.

this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time. when watching this movie , your filled with action, and when somethings not really happing , the humour is un matched. brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix , of a game show where criminals are the contestants, and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood.also arnold doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners.i don't want to spoil anything for you ,but i will tell you when arnold gives his "i'll be back line" he gets the best response of them all in this movie. hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did.

this is an awesome action film with great one liners from arnie!. it's stylishly made, with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied. the characters were awesome, and richard dawson, is very menacing as the main villain. yes it has tons of plot holes,however it's highly highly entertaining, with a great ending as well. it had a great story, too it, and arnie and maria conchita alonso had great chemistry together. the character development was also pretty good, with, some superb performances. the directing is great!. paul michael glaser, does a very good job here, with awesome use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, awesome camera angles, and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. there is a little bit of gore. we get a few bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, slit throat, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood, and an impaling. the acting is great!. arnold schwarzenegger is amazing as always, he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners, kicks that ass, and as always is a big physical presence!, and was tons of fun to watch! (arnie rules!). maria conchita alonso, does well here, she was really cute, and had good chemistry with arnie!. yaphet kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. marvin j. mcintyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!. richard dawson is awesome as the main villain, and was very very menacing, and he was fun to watch. jesse ventura,jim brown,erland van lidth,gus rethwisch,and professor toru tanaka, all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers. overall a must see! ****1/2 out of 5

mild spoilersin the near future, arnold stars as ben richards, a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'the running man', a deadly tv game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the 'stalkers'. of course, people are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold to prove the system wrong.i haven't read the stephen king book, but this is a great film regardless, one of arnold's best. he does what he does best in the action man role, delivering death with unforgettable one-liners. classics are probably the 'he was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a guy with barb wire, and 'he had to split!', referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically. dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter, and all the 'stalkers' are suitably camp. the action is violent, but its an action film. that's the point. the film is fast paced, and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. with starsky and hutch's paul michael glaser at the helm, and made in the wake of the success of the terminator, previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold, and very far fetched. but today, anyone who watches a lot of tv could see how the film is getting closer to reality. i wouldn't be surprised if i turn on the tv in the 'near future' and see a show not to far from this.on that depressing note, i must however recommend 'the running man' to anyone who likes the 80s, arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film. 9. 5 / 10

of all arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man. a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad. it may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. not when you think about it. currently, reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. if the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man? how long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the justice department? there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows.the biggest message of all is 'you are being lied to'. it's no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots. and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. it's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future. it's no secret that reality tv is not very realistic. it's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. usually it's far from the real truth.although rather different than stephen king's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical arnie formula. yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'i'll be back' (which he never really said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been (these two were considered before arnie believe it or not).the director is none other than dave starsky himself (paul michael glaser). it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. andrew davis (not a director i particularly like) was attached before glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.first of all, harold faltermeyer's score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release. gone is the horrid letterbox picture. in its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. the new dolby 5.1 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing. there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. definitely one of the best re-masters i've seen so far. two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'meet the stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.

i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago. then, the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional, if indeed they could ever transpire at all. not any longer. now, the politics, society, and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed.consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year the running man came out) that are present today:concern with, as richard dawson's character damon killian puts it, "traditional morality." checkentertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort on the part of contestants. checkcameras everywhere. checkrestricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports ("travel passes" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. checkan increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media. checkcomputer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage (such as the "digital matting" of ben richards' image onto the stunt double). checkjailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. checkflagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy; increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent. check, check, checkthen again, maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king novella. but just to be safe, i'm moving to switzerland.

for a low budget movie this was really good. i put this well above your average action b-movie. sean and corinne delivered in this movie, and they didn't seem camera shy. watch out for the cameos of jeanne and jared. i didn't think that the producers would even consider that, but the runner-ups deserve that much. i'll be looking forward to more of sean and corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry. sean's character seemed very genuine, and sexy corinne's character was pretty hard-nosed and on point. she connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence. it was a great idea to cast billy zane as the smart and witty villain. his charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch. the chemistry between zane and sean's character was pretty good. the action sequences weren't cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie. of course there were flaws, but that comes with the territory. overall, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for tv. sean and corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game. i hope that jeanne, jared, and the rest of the next action star cast get their chance to also join their co-stars in entertainment success.final judgment: ***/****

after watching the next action star reality tv series, i was pleased to see the winners' movie right away. i was leery of such a showcase of new talent, but i was pleasantly surprised and thrilled. billy zane, of course, was his usual great self, but corinne and sean held their own beside him. it was also nice to see jared and jeanne (also from the competition) in their cameo roles. sean's character, not billy's, is the hunted, and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played. corinne walks the tightrope well between her character liking sean's and only being in it for the money. i loved how the game was played right to the last second. and then beyond! not a great movie, but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the gate.

i thought this movie was excellent,for the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the business.it was packed with action and a little romance,but there were some points when corrine didn't speak very clearly (when she threatened sean with the gun) and she clenched her teeth...maybe she was supposed to?i think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very well,and there was an obvious contrast.also,because i watched next action star,i am certain that corrine and sean did their own stunts,which were performed very well.i am looking forward to another movie by the pair,as they make a great team,or perhaps a sequel to bet your life-possibly called 'making it big in the big apple',it could this time be about carmen..bet your life is excellent!

i thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for tv movie, and it contained both a lot of action and humor. i found the entertainment value worth watching, and would watch it again or a similar show again. i'm disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb.i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher "cash" stakes, since his life would be on the line again anyway.i felt that sean played the role very well, and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives - the soap opera.

i never watched the 'next action hero' show, and until reading the other comments here, did not know that this movie was the 'prize' from that competition. i was just flipping channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare eagerly, all the way to the end.yes, the plot's been done (the most dangerous game, etc.) but i was hoping for, and almost received, the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. i think the high-tech was overdone (gps's) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of night rider, but it nevertheless was not too overdone.the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod (suspension of disbelief) that was required of the viewer. do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate? could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up? pleeease. way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much.the final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the after taste of a bad star trek episode. at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for zane, who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves imho - they were winners from a reality show.knock me out.

tenchu aka. hitokiri- directed by hideo gosha - starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs (together with goyokin, hara kiri & rebellion) to the best chambara movies existing.its the story about shintaro katsu (who plays okada izo) working for nakadei, who wants to become the daymio. okada, being the "cleaner" for nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to nakadei.but there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!!(tenchu means heavens punishment)

this is one of the best of the genre. i saw it twice about 25yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then. it rivals the zatoichi series (also starring katsu) in exciting swordplay.

gosha's last great film of the 1960's. a resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his films, gosha teamed up with shintaro katsu (of zatoichi fame) to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty. "tenchu" (heavenly judgment) is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or "traitors" to the cause. katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride. anybody who questions the politician is labeled a "traitor" and becomes an assassination target.one of the best photographed films ever, many shots are incredible compositions of form, color and light. the fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. the blood becomes a part of the color palette gosha uses for his images. gorgeous and disturbing. while the personal story is simple to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it. the few drawbacks to the film are the music track, the length and katsu's occasional scenery chewing. he has a drunken scene that's way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk.downbeat but one of the great chambara films.

this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist, who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan. really, i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background.shintaro katsu (also known as the original zatoichi) gives a superb performance as izo okada, one of the four hitokiri(=human slayer) of the bakumatsu. he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth. in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei (played by tatsuya nakada = ryonosuke out of sword of doom). hanpei is a ultra-nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro-west politicians in order to achieve his political goals. izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore. okada's killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening. first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto ( who is a samurai who rejects violence) does he change his ideas and views on life. but too late....watch the movie to see the end of izo okada...shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance. each actor reaches up to their role. the sword-fights a very unique and fast...probably faster than several movies nowadays...check it out if you have the chance!!!

it's a testament to gosha's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece, goyokin, in the same year, 1969. and it's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public (compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa), that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them.shintaro katsu is okada izo: mad dog killer, loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi, played by another genre stalwart, tatsuya nakadai. the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate. the historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with japan's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion. it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate, but it's not essential by any means. the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well.as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years (the late 60's) the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty. style however is never decorative for gosha - it is always employed in the service of story. and speaking of story, hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada. as most chambara protagonists, izo finds himself in a moral double-bind, torn between giri (obligation) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is. in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self-advancement. lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan. the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes, the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self. it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a "nameless" drifter without past or future, torazo the vagrant. although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbo's mold, it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego, ambition and self-dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself. hitokiri ends (which i won't reveal here) in the best way any story can end: both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh, a last sardonic remark in the face of death.

hitokiri (which translates roughly as "assassination"), a/k/a "tenchu" which translates roughly as "divine punishment") showcases hideo gosha at the top of his form. do not miss this one, or gosha's other classic, goyokin! hitokiri is not only one of gosha's best films, it's one of the best "samurai/chambara" films ever made, and perhaps one of the best japanese films ever exported.be warned, all of the intricate plot details in hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century japanese history. even so, the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. as per the norm for gosha, hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of "loyalty to one's lord" vs. "doing the right thing". however, gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication, that it's really _the_ movie to see (along with goyokin, of course).i suppose it breaks down like this: if you want a simpler, more action-oriented tale, you might want to see goyokin. however, if you want a more thoughtful, multilayered (albeit grim) drama, see this one.(ok, ok, essentially, the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either (1) working to reform, yet retain, the tokugawa shogunate, and (2) those who are trying to install the emperor meiji as the supreme ruler of japan. of course, those clans working "for" emperor meiji were often less interested in "reforming" japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the "new world order". ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the meiji government. it's ironic twists like this -- gosha's big on irony -- that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet.)what distinguishes "hitokiri" from gosha's other movies is gosha's mature sense of cinematography. every shot is thoughtfully composed, and (much like kubrick's barry lyndon) each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition. of course, this is typical gosha. hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops, including(as with goyokin) many riveting seascapes. just watch the opening sequence, and you're hooked! make no mistake, this is no english period piece: hitokiri is extremely violent (don't say you weren't warned).what else, other than cool camera work, makes hitokiri stand out? the performances seem (to me) a bit more subtle in this one. katsu shintaro (of zatoichi/hanzo the razor fame) turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist/antihero, okada izo. katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain. throughout the movie, you're never quite sure if you're engaged or revolted by okada's character. at the same time, katsu's portrayal of okada's ravenous hunger for respect, and his later pathetic attempts at redemption, seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy/sympathy. of course, after seeing nakadai tatsuya play the tortured hero in "goyokin", it's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in "hitokiri". he's just perfect, there's nothing more to say!as a final note, perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans, don't miss the last screen appearance of mishima yukio (yes, the closeted gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering japanese military personnel he "kidnapped" in 1970, and had a movie on his life and work made by paul schrader), who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable (for an assassin) shinbei tanaka.

this movie is the next segment in the pokemon movies which supplies everything on hopes and dreams of a pokemon warrior named ash ketchim and his friends. they go out and they look battle and run into new pokemon and take on new adventures with pikachu and other pokemon favorites. this adventure takes on with a new pokemon called celebi a time pokemon. go join ash brock and misty to find all sorts of new things!

whoever says pokemon is stupid can die. this movie is superlative. i even shead a tear when celebei died. i don't cry much! this film is a touching animated thriller. in this fourth installment of pokemon, ash and friends must stop the bad jerk from making celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball. in the time, sam and celebei travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunters. i like the part with the double battle and sam has the apricorn pokeball (if you've played pokemon gold, silver, or crystal, you know what it is.)i also enjoyed having miramax in charge instead of warner brothers. putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea. the pokemon in this movie come to life more than ever.

my brother and i have pokemon 4ever on dvd. we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best. too bad it a new pokemon didn't talk this time. i'll get used to it.the iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball. good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control.there was only one song in the ending credits called cele-b-r-a-t-e performed by russell velazquez.pokemon 4ever became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film.

the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when celebi died. don't you dare say that pokemon sucks! i don't like it when people say that.... i've liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy pokemon, including this movie and other pokemon movies. so, without further ado, please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages. and also, why do pokemon-haters give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies? i don't understand.... they shouldn't do that.... there's absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that: 1) pokemon is for little kids only. 2) pokemon is stupid. and 3) people shouldn't like pokemon. i think this is why people don't like pokemon.

i have always enjoyed the pokemon movies. yes, i know, all of them are very corny, mediocre in some certain areas and sure, even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement,"hey, lighten up, it's a kids movie," but all that aside, aren't they still good pieces of entertainment? in my opinion, they are so and i enjoy them greatly. this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and certainly cuter. it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable, fresh pokemon celebi. it's not the best pokemon movie, but i do enjoy it more than the third installment, even though the third is not bad, and the entire series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. this film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially around the climax/ending, as do all the installments, and the characters, while a bit more lackluster than the previous three, i thought, are still likable and humorous. this films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions, and it doesn't deserve that.

out of these pokemon films (which are in order of best to least for me): pokemon the first movie, pokemon 4ever, pokemon heroes, pokemon 200 and pokemon: entei and the unknown, this is probably the one most concerning the environment, arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one. whether these are good points for you or not, "pokemon 4ever," still has entertained many.as well as the three points covered above, this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi (as well as anime). the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket (the comic reliefs/rubbish baddies) end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks. the flaws are, as always, the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting, even more so than a few pokemon film baddies. a strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest. a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere...meanwhile, ash, brock and misty are entering a large forest...curious? watch the rest...good for all pokemon fans and "american" anime movie fans, enjoy "pokemon 4ever"! :-)

i so love this movie! the animation is great (for a pokémon movie), the cgi looks so awesome. i love the music in the movie. so great they kept the japanese music.as for the story: its great. it has a great feeling of friendship. celebi is a very cute and powerful pokémon. ash is really great in this movie, and i like his friendship with sam. the only thing i didn't like was suicune's appearance, he just suddenly pops up, helps ash & co a bit and leaves. they could have made his part in the movie a little bigger.but overall, awesome movie! can't wait to own the usa version on dvd!

another pokemon movie has hit the theaters, and again, i'm hearing the same old, "pokemon is dead, blah blah blah." the franchise's detractors couldn't be more wrong. kids are still playing the trading card game, they're still watching the tv series, they're waiting for the game boy advance games, and they want to see "pokemon the 4th movie."that said, "pokemon the 4th movie" introduces us to two more "legendary" pokemon: suicune, the "north wind" of lore, and celebi, guardian of the forest (and star of the show). celebi transports itself and a boy named sam 40 years into the future, to the present day, where pokemon trainer ash, his faithful pikachu, and his friends brock and misty are traveling through johto. sam and ash become fast friends, once they discover the other's mutual love for pokemon (sam's vintage pokeball with screw-on top is a great moment). together, they decide to protect celebi from the villain of the story, the team rocket agent aptly named vicious, who is hell-bent on capturing celebi for his own ends. will ash and sam be able to protect celebi from vicious' dark balls? where does suicune fit into the picture? will jessie, james, and meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before? and just who is sam, really?like with the first 3 movies, if you go into the movie deciding that you're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it's pokemon (or just because your child/niece/nephew/younger sibling/et cetera "dragged" you into it), then you're going to hate it because you've decided that you want to hate it. that may be, but to blindly trash "pokemon the 4th movie" simply because it is a pokemon movie, and especially without having seen it, is just plain stupid. even non-fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of pokemon. i'm not saying that you will become a pokemon fan because of this movie, but you can indeed enjoy it, if you'll let yourself.unlike the first 3 pokemon movies, "pokemon the 4th movie" is being distributed by miramax, who i've heard is also working on securing the rights to the 5th pokemon movie, which was released this past summer in japan. miramax claims to have some boffo-aggressive marketing strategy for "pokemon the 4th movie," but all i've seen so far is a feeble limited release, which doesn't include the usual pikachu short in the beginning, which i was really looking forward to this time. i hope that miramax will see fit to put the pikachu short, called "pikachu's exciting hide-and-seek," onto at least the dvd/vhs release, if not with a future wider release of "pokemon the 4th movie." i hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film.

i can't see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm, when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly about. this is a fun movie. my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it. granted, the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher, but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark, gloomy, and very morbid pokemon 3. my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will "put off the childish things" and move on to others. i am glad that we got to enjoy this together.

as a pokémon fan i enjoyed this movie very much. it introduces new legendary pokémon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. i however do not expect those who are not pokémon fans to enjoy it(this includes most adults). some of the lines were corny, but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english. the animation was beautiful, although there were a couple parts that did not look good. and although the villain is kind of corny, i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains, and i guarantee you that they aren't all like this one. those who did not like it, i say to each his own, but pokémon fans will love it.

this is a great movie. in the same genre of the "memphis belle". seen it about 10 years ago. and would like to see it again. there is a link with the history of the hells angels!! how the pilot crew fight the germans in wo2. and most changes form pilots to harley motor cycle rs. the movie is in a way really happened. see the movie! and reed the history of the hells angels at hells at hells angels.com regards frederik.cast & crew: john stamos, john stockwell, teri polo, kris kamm, directed by graham baker more » synopsis: the story of a rowdy backwoods rebel biker who joins the army to avoid a stiff prison sentence after a minor brush with the law. though he chafes at army discipline, he soon proves himself under fire as a daring and charismatic leader of men in a motorcycle scout troop in pr-world war ii spain. more » mpaa rating: pg runtime: 88 minutes

for what it is, this is a pretty good movie. i like both johns -stamos ("full house")& stockwell ("christine", "top gun"). they both give strong performances. the love interest is ok, but this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie. i love harleys, and i hated seeing them paint over the "14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer" with good old army olive drab. there is a small history lesson here in that harley-davidson motorcycles played a key role in wwii. i don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! the movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere, with good riding action sequences. i love looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, i guess). i wouldn't give it a 10, but i did give it an 8. i do not weigh every movie with the same scale. there are movies that were big-budget, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big. (star wars - episode i is my best example) i loved the first three sw movies, but i thought episode i was weak in comparison. so it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. i expect more from george lucas.

this entertainingly tacky'n'trashy distaff "death wish" copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well-endowed brunette hottie supreme karin mani as billie clark, a top-notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup-a** on assorted no-count scuzzy muggers, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-life criminals attack her beloved grand parents. the stunningly voluptuous ms. mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with winningly spunky aplomb, beating jerky guys up with infectious glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous, but much-appreciated nude scenes. unfortunately, mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing-on-marbles harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (my favorite moment concerning mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips "don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!" after clobbering a few detestable hooligans. the delectable karin's sole subsequent film role was in "avenging angel," in which she does a truly eye-popping full-frontal nude scene, but doesn't have any lines.) the film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene. of course, mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown! strangely enough, the lesbian forgives mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars. given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by edward victor's punchy direction, a funky-rockin' score, endearingly crummy acting by a game (if lame) cast, a constant snappy pace, numerous pull-out-all-the-stops exciting fight scenes, and howard anderson iii's gritty photography, this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is essential viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk.

action & adventure.billie clark is twenty years old, very pretty, and without a care in the world,until a brutal street gang violates her life, and she turns into an alley cat bent on revenge! when the gang attacks her grandparents house and her car, billie uses her black belt prowess to fight them off. but at the same time she earns their hatred, and she and her grandparents are marked for vengence.when her grandparents lose their lives to the brutal thugs. billie becomes like a cat stalking her prey-and no prison,police force,boyfriend,or crooked judge can get in the way of her avenging claws. she's a one-woman vigilante squad,a martial arts queen,a crack shot with no mercy. she's the alley cat.watch for the dramatic ending versus the gang leader! rated r for nudity & violence, other films with karin mani: actress - filmography,avenging angel (1985) .... janie soon lee , "from here to eternity" (1979) (mini) tv series .... tawny, filmography as: actress, stunts - filmography,avenging angel (1985) (stunts)p.s. she should have been catwoman in the batman movie!

the invaders is a fast moving sci-fi thriller starring ben cross and sean young. ben plays renn, a traveller from another galaxy trying to find annie (played by sean) who is physically ideal to have his child. this child, if allowed to be born and returned to his planet, may be the only chance for his race to survive. the enemy, an alien who has destroyed renn's people, has also followed renn across the stars to stop this birth. cross again shows great range from comical beginnings as the alien enters a local bar and orders his first earthling cocktail, to his race with the enemy and the drama of whether he can keep annie and the child she is carrying alive.

this is a pretty strange movie. it does comes across as an exploitation film with over-the-top violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual for being constructed around rural characters at war with each other, as opposed to an invading 'other'.the movie is an excessive stereotype of vietnam veterans, in a long line of films that portrayed the vets of that war as dangerous psycopaths. kris kristofferson's last line is 'i ain't lost a war yet', as he meets his demise after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction, including the town's chief of police and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene. however, kristofferson is a good enough actor, and charismatic enough, to carry this villain with a surprising depth. vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness. the movie bears some plot resemblance to winchester 73 where jimmy stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until being forced to act against him.the movie has b-movie grade action, though the presence of kristofferson, vincent, a gorgeous victoria principal and bernadette peters give it an a-grade lineup.i give it a 7 for being a long lost view into an american psyche of post-vietnam/pre-reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a movie industry that was willing to address such topics at that time.seen on the this channel, a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies of the 70s through 90s, regardless of political bent.

anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of elk hills. the town elders deputize tough, cagey vietnam veteran aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by kris kristofferson) and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place. the plan goes sour when aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over elk hills after they get rid of all the bad elements. it's up to aaron's decent do-gooder brother ben (amiably played by jan-michael vincent) to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand. writer/director george ("miami blues," "gross pointe blank") armitage whips up a delightfully amoral, cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive-in exploitation contemporary western winner: he expertly creates a gritty, no-nonsense tone, keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout, and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb (the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring). the first-rate cast of familiar b-feature faces constitutes as a major asset: victoria principal as ben's sweet hottie girlfriend linda, the fabulous bernadette peters as flaky saloon singer little dee, brad dexter as the feckless mayor, david doyle as a slimy bank president, andrew stevens as an affable gas station attendant, john carpenter movie regular charles cyphers as one of the 'nam vets, anthony carbone as a smarmy casino manager, john steadman as a folksy old diner owner, paul gleason as a mean strong-arm shakedown bully, and dick miller as a talentless piano player. moral: don't hire other people to do your dirty work. william cronjager's slick cinematography, gerald fried's lively, harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score, and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy.

this movie could only originate in the 1970's!! it's a bizarre action movie set in a small california workers town. some sort of mill or plant is closing down, so suddenly, rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets! the townsfolk's are fed up! so ben arnold (jan michael vincent), goes to another town to recruit his brother, aaron, played by kris kristofferson. aaron is a vietnam vet who looks and acts a littleoff balance. he hangs out with a bunch of other surly vietnam vet's. they come into town to clean it up (they become deputized), but underneath their good deeds, they are actually running gambling houses, asking for protection money, etc.!!! it takes a while for people to catch on, and in a biblical cain and abel showdown, vincent has to take on his older brother. there's an interesting blue-collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie, which makes it interesting (note the cock-fighting scene!). vincent is almost too angelic in this role  he thinks so highly of his brother, he cannot conceive of him committing the evil deeds he's accused of. he finally comes to his senses  his girlfriend, victoria principal, is brutally shot in the back & he himself is beaten up in his home. kris kristofferson is creepily effective as aaron. he coolly denies any wrong-doing, and even gently coos and talks to vincent's young daughter (she refers to him as 'uncle aaron') even while he's threatening her father's life, all the while smiling! vincent and kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other. bernadette peters makes an interesting appearance as a 'saloon' girl who attracts aaron's attention. this is a good 70's action movie, if you can find it!! it is not available on dvd yet

this in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the 1970s. it not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. the story is about a vietnam vet (kris kristofferson) being recruited by his brother (jan-michael vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of. it's great seeing kris play against type. bernadette peeters and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. jan-michael shows real movie star persona in this film. i don't think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv. it's a great flick for guys who like movies.

i used to watch this show as a child, and i loved it! i watched it when it came on toonami years ago....sheesh, i sound so old! i must've been 13 or 14 when it came on...but anyways, it had a great plot line, and i'm one of those girlie-girls who watched (and adored) sailormoon, and i enjoyed it very much. the animation wasn't the best....quite amusing in some parts, actually, and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning, but it was all a good watch, and i found myself sucked into it day after day.samurai troopers/ronin warriors is a classic, and an all-time one of my faves. go ryo!!!!

for starters, i didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. i have not once seen it on tv before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. it is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years.i don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points. even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. when the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years. this gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows.the overall design is also something very different. at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).if you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. the only question remains though, where is the dvd?!

the maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird-out superhero story. julie winters is a "freelance social worker" in an unnamed filthy city, ridden with crime, and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through. the maxx is her friend and client, a street bum who thinks he's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around?the maxx is not to be missed for the artwork, the story itself, or the excellent voice work - particularly the late barry stigler's deliciously urbane, drippingly evil voicing of the main villain, mr. gone.if you get the chance to see this, don't miss it.

"most of us at least inhabit two worlds , the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world within ,the unconscious ,a safe place where we can escape ..." with those words ,mr .gone introduces inside the world of "the maxx" a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined . inspired in the comic books of sam kieth, "the maxx " is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired , not only in the story but also in the graphic style ,that look like the pages of the comic ,giving this show a surreal and unique appearance . but also ,the story it's interesting and entertaining .at moments it could turn too weird ,but when you got inside it ,it's hard to get out of it . the story and the characters are wonderfully developed . the music goes perfectly with the style of the show and give it the proper atmosphere . unfortunately , like many good animated shows ,this one was short -lived . "the maxx" is a must see . it 's one of my all -time favorites .

the internet database lists this as a tv show. and yes, it was a series on mtv shown on the "oddities" program, after "the head" and before "aeon flux" if i recall correctly. but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.you have the story of the maxx, julie winters, sarah and mr. gone. the maxx is a super-hero or a bum, julie a social worker or a leopard queen, sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr. gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on. and then there's the other weird creatures...i use "or" with maxx and julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. maybe they're all real or dreams. maybe one of the characters doesn't exist. maybe only one exists and dreams of the others. you'll have to wait and find out.i had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. the artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in superman or batman. it will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive. and the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story... guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced. this was the best show to appear on "oddities", hands down.if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out. it's "donnie darko" before there was ever such a thing.the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but i don't say this in disappointment. by keeping it simple, they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures.

this movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which michael jackson wields a tommy gun. plain and simple.this movie rocks because it is freaking' hilarious! it may be creepy to see jacko w/ little kids, but this movie also stars.......................................... wait for it,.....................joe pesci!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!think about it, joe pesci and jacko with tommy guns, throwing coins into jukeboxes from 20 feet away? whats not to like? as stated before, this movie rocks!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! ! !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family!before the real story of the movie starts, we get a performance of the bad tour (man in the mirror), and it kicks off a great movie. after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier, as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988. after a few music videos also (speed demon, leave me alone, etc.) the story starts.the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends (who are kids) are being chased by the bad guy of the story "mr. big", because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs. during the chase we see fantastic segments, fx. michaels video for smooth criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr. big, and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict.during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards, but also impressive today. for instance, see michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends! it's so cool!the movie ends with a performance of come together (later published in michaels double-album of history), and you leave the movie with a magic feeling. amazing!i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv. and now some parents might stand up and say: "but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser!" yeah, he is indeed, but, come on, we all know it isn't true! wait and see..

michael is king. this film contains some of the best stuff mike has ever done. smooth criminal is pure genius. the cameos are wonderful, but as always, the main event is mj himself. he is the best, hands down.

this movie is my all time favorite!!! you really have to see michael jackson in this wonderful film!! i'm always over the moon, watching it!! this is a film, that you really have to see, also if you aren't a mj fan, cause this film writes, like captain eo, e.t. and ghosts, a bit of film and music history!! this wonderful film, out of michael's feather, is a must have!! and: smooth criminal, is really the most wonderful, exciting and amazing song i've ever heard in my life!! thank you michael for this film and i love you!!! mj's the best musician to hit this planet, he's a fine man and he always brings sparkles in your eyes, when you listen to his music!! please, if you don't know this film, watch it and don't miss it, because would be too bad for yourself if you'd miss it!! -highly recommanded film, for every movie lover-

moonwalker is a fantasy music film staring michael jackson with different segments. i will rate each segment individually.segment 1 opens the film with a music video. the music video is a concert of michael jackson performing the song "man in the mirror", the music video also show's montages of historical figures such as gandhi, martin luther king jr, john lennon and more. the first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures. i even loved the message in the song. i give the first segment a 9/10.segment 2 shows a montage of michael jackson's start from the jackson five to his solo career. the montage i thought was well made, i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as "i i want you back, beat it, thriller, can you feel it and the way you make me feel." the only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is "we are the world". the reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of michael jackson and the chorus of the celebrities, but it's a little hard to see the chorus. other than that the segment is still good. i give it a 9/10segment 3 is the song bad. you're probably thinking it's michael jackson's music video of bad,well yes and no. this segment is the music video but it's redone by kids. the segment was cute but it wasn't as good as the other segments. i give it a 6/10segment 4 is a short claymation music film that takes place after the kid's version of bad called "speed demon". the short is about michael jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them. the claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the claymation characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people. also at the end of the clip out of nowhere michael jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he's dancing with it. i liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere. i give it a 8/10segment 5 is michael jackson's grammy winning music video "leave me alone." the music video is about the media poking their nose at michael jackson's personal life and michael jackson feels they won't leave him alone no matter how much he's proved innocent. the music video really speaks out( but keep in mind this happened before the child molestation this just all about the rumors of him in the 80's.) but i didn't feel this video should be in this movie because it's a kids movie and i don't think kid's will understand what he's singing about. i give this music video 8/10segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called "smooth criminal." michael jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children ( including john lennon's son sean lennon) from an evil mobster named mr bigg (played by joe pesci). the segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he danced and sang the song "smooth criminal" with a bunch of criminals. i also thought the special effects were good. the weird thing about the segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why. also joe pesci character talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. i mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film. other wise it was good. my rating for this segment is a 8/10segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie. the film end's with michael jackson singing a cover version of the beatle's song "come together" and then during the credit's we see michael jackson singing with ladysmith black mambazo. michael did a good cover of "come together" and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good singer's with a talented musican like him. my rating is 9/10this movie is a good michael jackson film i think it really brings out children s imagination. the film is almost as imaginative as the beatles animated movie "yellow submarine" if you like michael jackson and you're up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film. my overall rating for this movie is 8/10

and i don't say it in a bad way.i watched this movie at the cinema when i was 6 or 7. for me and my cousins it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. when we left the theatre, michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it.over the years, i saw this movie being aired a few times but i always changed the channel. even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart. and i liked it that way.so i've only seen this movie once and i believe it was a good decision not to watch it again. if i saw it today, i know i couldn't help but criticise mj's acting, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. for me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years ago.i see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it an 8 for the memories and wonderful music. for that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 10.

i first saw this when they showed this around easter time 1993/4 and didn't think much of it then, i bought this on dvd last summer when i started getting into michael jackson (i liked his music before) and enjoyed it more now i am older. it is a good film but it won't be this classic film like the sound of music, west side story, the wizard of oz etc. michael jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. there were a disturbing scenes like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie lideo who was played by joe pesci. the scene that frightened me when i was younger was when michael turns into a robot. my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think it was better than thriller in my opinion.

at long last! one of michael jackson's most well known and beloved films comes to dvd! in michael jackson moonwalker, (michael jackson) stars as michael. a man with powers that are not of this world. michael must save sean (sean lennon), katie (kellie parker), zeke (brandon quintin adams), and the rest of the worlds children from drug lord frankie lideo aka mr. big (joe pesci) who's mission in life is to get all of the worlds children hooked on drugs! a note to people in the usa looking for this film on dvd: make sure when buying this film on dvd you buy warners product #wk00817 as ntsc region 3 which plays on north american ntsc region 1 players.

this is by far my most favourite movie in the world!!!!! i enjoyed it when i was 4 and i still enjoy it at 16!! its an absolute masterpiece! no video collection is complete without it!!! i enjoy every second of it and not only does the film have some great special affects but its sends a great message to the youngsters of the audience which may sound sheesy but in actual fact the movie is done very cooly in actual fact! although michael jackson has been in afew movies now, people still dont see him as an actor. in reality he's the most talented actor i know! he's so talented! he's incredible!!! moonwalker is a must see!!!!!!

this movie is exciting,daring and the music is very good.the movie moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album bad(1987).i have bad.it is excellent(*****).the movie begins with michael jackson performing"man in the mirror"on stage.then,it shows a history of michael,from his early days in the jackson 5 right up to the bad era. oh,and badder is good too(badder is a music video parody of the music video for bad the single).it then shows the speed demon video.the song and the video are very,very good indeed.same for leave me alone,which appears after.then it shows the movie moonwalker.after a few minutes,he plays smooth criminal in a club called club 30s.like it when he does the lean.anyway,nice to see you.bye bye.

moonwalker is absolutely incredible !!!!!!! what else can i say !? michael jackson is the true king of pop, rock and soul !!! moonwalker has everything ! great story line, fantastic music, great visual effects, and of course it has michael jackson !!!!!!

wow, i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage. it's a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids. the vignettes are good (especially speed demon), but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment, in which michael jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it's just as weird as it sounds). joe pesci is hilarious, and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout!the real gem however is the incredible "smooth criminal" video, which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone!

michael jackson is not very popular in usa anymore, however in europe (especially germany) he has still got lots of fans. many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: it has no plot, it's full of cliches, michael praises himself constantly.but, you can't expect a plot or non-cliches in this kind of movie! it has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect. the smooth criminal fragment - the greatest song ever, full of moonwalks, group dance acts and even the famous "michael jackson's bench-over" - makes this film one of jackson's masterpieces with an even good-looking (and white...) michael jackson!a must for jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance act fans.however, as i'm an mj fan, i should warn all michael jackson haters out there: don't watch this movie, you'd only make your hate increase...

(there isn't much in the way of spoilers, since there isn't a plot to reveal, but still, i guess i describe some of what happens so...) this is it. this is the most nonsensical film i've ever seen. there are simply no words to describe this movie, although "bizarre" "ridiculous" and "ego trip" are pretty close. the opening half hour or so are really, really weird music videos, with absolutely no plot or continuity, apart from that mj falls into some from the previous. one of the highlights of this part of the "film" in the section where mj is flying a merry-go-round aeroplane through what seem to be half-arsed bond intro rejects and sections cut from yellow submarine (dear lord you could not make this up).then, with a little over an hour remaining, the "film" begins, with a lot of claymation (some of it really creepy) spotting our "hero" and chasing him looking for an autograph. obviously, this leaves our as of yet mute (discounting songs) lead somewhat worried, and he manages to temporarily lose them. fortunate for him, because it means he can witness a falling star and, and again, i'm not making this up, turn into a claymation rabbit. he uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them, but, for reasons i can't recall right now, they see through it (oh no!) and the creepy chase begins again. cue another song (big shock there).shortly after the end of the chase, mj somehow brings the rabbit to life, until he is busted by a policeman (in the middle of the desert) because it is, apparently, illegal to dance there.the rest of the film is equally as strange, highlights including mj cleaning up a bar to the tune of smooth criminal, including shooting a man with his finger, not only killing the guy, but burning his shadow into the wall, a la nuclear fission weapons. another good moment is when mj, seeing, mr big (joe "what the hell happened to his career at this point?" peschi) kidnap one of the children he was friends with, magically creates a tommy gun, and in another moment of violence that pepper this film seemingly at random, opens fire at everything that moves. a final moment i shall mention is when mj, surrounded by mr big and his private army. seriously, this guy has dozens of people working for him, and they're decked out more like commando units rather than mobsters, which i guess they are. how does he get out? why, he turns into a robot, complete with weapons and shield. this is the third of four transformations he makes, almost always when backed into a corner and/or on the run.this film is quite, quite surreal, with little in the way of plot, and virtually no continuity.

if you see this movie, you know you will see an extense video-clip of popular music. but you will find more. incredible fx, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. if you compare this movie, you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. clips of "man in the mirror", "leave me alone", "smooth criminal" and beatles' "come together".

this is, in my opinion, a very good film, especially for michael jackson lovers. it contains a message on drugs, stunning special effects, and an awesome music video.the main film is centered around the song and music video 'smooth criminal.' unlike the four-minute music video, it is normal speed and, in my opinion, much easier to watch.the plot is rather weird, however. michael jackson plays a magical 'gangster' that, when he sees a shooting star, he transforms into a piece of machinery. throughout the film, he transforms into a race car, a giant robot, and a space ship.the robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange. i found it a little out-of-whack compared to the rest of the film.a child is kidnapped, michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys. a little weird? yeah.but besides the bizarre robot scene, it's a very good movie, and any michael jackson fan will enjoy both the smooth criminal music video and the movie.

moonwalker is such a great movie, from start to finish you cant take your eyes away. i love all the clips of michael singing and dancing and i just love the 'studio tour' bit...soo funny :) and the 'mini movie' is to cool, with all the special fx etc...michael is a genius and always will be!!!

i think that this movie is very neat. you eithier like michael jackson or you don't, but if you like him then you have to see this movie. i think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination. not to mention the film center piece smooth criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see.

mr michael jackson is an artistic phenomenon. his short movies, i.e. music videos, are simply the best. i do not care if i get a sane sci-fi feature from this man, but i do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing, shriek yells, cool crowd choreography, and some bits of cgi and animation. there also should be a few uninterrupted videos. everything i've mentioned is here. stupid plot and over-the-top "vanity fair" are not a problem when i witness mr michael jackson in action. to me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not "king of pop" which sounds moronic, especially for us, russians, because "pop" sounds like the russian word for "arses" and mj is definitely not "king of arses"). i can re-watch his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and i never get tired of them.my first impression of this film was "what is this...?" (bits of different videos, some drawn images, unsettling jumps from one theme to another, absence of any cohesive plot line, some kids fooling around, etc.) but as i watched it till the end, i could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on tv nowadays. what i like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily.without mr michael jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of mj musical insanity and artistic quality. he knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles.when i see a proper dvd release with mr michael jackson videos i know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. "history i", "history ii", and "moonwalker" are all great, though only "moonwalker" is more like one movie (with a solid "smooth criminal" theme, "paparazzi" topic, and a few weird spoofs and twists).being no fan of mj i can still give this "film... like no other" a solid 9 out of 10 (i've been hit by "smooth criminal" for sure and my major complains are the following: initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main "mj anti-drug campaign" should have been given more "sky-rocketing insanity and stress" and there should have been more "moonwalking" itself of course). thanks for attention.

only a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie, but nevertheless moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music, dance and entertainment. beginning with the montage of video clips from jackson's long career, it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as 'the king of pop'. from his hit 'i want you back' to 'we are the world' the multi-award winning charity record for the benefit of africa. following this a short movie of sorts, although lacklustre in an oscar winning script, nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. ending with a perfect (sexy!) rendition of 'come together'. something the whole family can watch and enjoy.

moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you're not a michael jackson fan. i'm a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film, the ending wasn't fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were - if you're a fan.i personally believe the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over. the dancing in each video is breathtaking, the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining.it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos. it also includes some live concert footage.if you're a big fan of michael jackson this is a must, if you're not a fan/don't like michael jackson, steer well clear.9/10

this movie is great.now, i do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue, but now and then, something like moonwalker comes along, and it's watchable, despite numerous flaws.this film is no more than a highly entertaining michael jackson advertisement. beginning with sickly video set to 'man in the mirror' a montage listing his achievements, and bits and bobs from his career, it goes through all the highs of his life, then crashes down into a really, really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for 'bad' and 'speed demon', following the adventures of mj as he runs from manic stop-motion fans, and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. the stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe. it's passable.then we see the great video for 'leave me alone', and straight into the main feature.yes, the plot is laughable. very laughable. we see michael walk out of a building, then get shot at by thousands of troops. then we hit flashback, showing mj and three children stumbling upon an underground lair. 'mr big' (joe pesci) is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on 'drugs' (no specifics are mentioned) at an early age. mj and the little girl he is with get caught, then chased... yada yada yada. the plot isn't really the important part. we get two very cool sequences where mj turns into a car, then a robot-spaceship thing, and of course, the amazing 'smooth criminal' sequence.it's a so-so film, but it is fantastic for anyone who likes mj. it has most of his greatest hits, and some cool little bits, and some quite good special effects (the robot/spaceship sequence in particular) worth it, especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay. it'll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours, as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released.

with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj i've started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again. maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. some of it has subtle messages about mj's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me. because mj overheard his plans? nah, joe pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates mj's music.lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence. also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.bottom line, this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another (which i think is most people). if not, then stay away. it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mj's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? well, with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. i hope he is not the latter.

i was a kid .. crazy about michael jackson. his music, his dancing .. he was and is the greatest of all times. few days ago a friend gave me a present .. "moonwalker" dvd .. i just couldn't believe it! so i took my time and saw the movie again.. after a lot of years, and it kicked me back in time. i almost cried. not because of michael jackson but of the good old times i remembered back than when i went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. the movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid. you can truly see the parody that michael went through his life. thank you michael jackson to bring me back to those great times, to your great music and dancing. it's a shame that people has forgotten you .. i didn't because you gave me great moments with your music .. all the best to you where ever you are out there ..

the first time i saw this "film" i loved it. when i was 11, i was more interested in the music and dancing. as i've grown older, i've become more interested in the acting as well. while the first half is just a retrospective of michael's career (from the jackson 5 up to "bad"), it was still entertaining to watch. the "badder" sequence could've been left out, though the kids were pretty good. "speed demon" and "leave me alone" were funny, especially when the police officer tells michael, "i need your autograph right here", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. but it's "smooth criminal" that's the icing on the cake. joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). the dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects. the only thing i could have done without was the spiders. any fan of michael's should see this, if you haven't already. i give it a 10+!

if you want to remember mj, this is a good place to start. this movie features sweet tunes, mj as robot, and a crazy, messed-up plot. i recall, many a night, passing out to this fine feature film in college, and pondering the sheer awesomenes of whoever decided to green light this ridiculous piece of .there is lots of singing. lots of dancing. there is lots of singing while dancing. mj slays it as you would expect when it comes to this stuff. but there is much more to this movie. there is claymation. there are fat children (clay). there is an anthropomorphic rabbit that michael jackson has to battle in a dance off (obviously clay too). there is joe pesci as well (not made of clay).rip- we love you michael! it is a sad day for all of us.

actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other mj movies like "the wiz", "captain eo" and "ghosts". but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years, (yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), i can't complain too much about it. just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. but as a movie, it's not good at all, and i'm afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my darling mike hadn't been the one starring in it. but since no one but mike is the moonwalker, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.

i've loved this movie ever since it first came out. i was about nine years old, and now i'm 27. i remember playing the video game on sega genisis. i had so much fun, i would love to show my son this movie. he likes michael jackson as well and i know he will love this movie just as i did when i was a kid. even though he's much younger than i was when i first saw it. i can't wait for it to come out on dvd! i hope it comes out on dvd! please let it come out on dvd!! i'm dying to see it again!!! well that is my comment i hope that one day soon i'll get to view this movie again. i love all of the videos in this movie. my favorite mini-video is badder!

ah, moonwalker, i'm a huge michael jackson fan, i grew up with his music, thriller was actually the first music video i ever saw apparently. believe it or not there was a time where michael jackson was like a god to people, a time where women fainted at the sight of him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him, sorry, michael. but moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of michael's success of the time right when he released his famous bad album that was record breaking, was the first album to have 6 top ten singles. michael is an incredible artist, there is no doubt, he writes, sings, dances, but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight with his audience not so much.we start off pretty simple: jackson's music, life, career, success and the mania that was the 80's biggest star in the world michael jackson. later on, jackson is a 30's style gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect the children. when jackson was allowed to be near children, we cut to him playing in a field with the children and their dog. the dog runs away, and in their search for it, jackson and the children uncover the lair of mr. big, frankie lideo, a drug dealing mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire populace of planet earth addicted to drugs, starting with the children. mr. big discovers jackson and the children, but they escape; jackson tells the children to meet him at club 30's, which turns out to be a haunted nightclub abandoned since the 1930s. the story goes back to the mobsters attack on jackson, and here it is revealed that jackson is actually a magical gangster, who draws his power from shooting stars. as one passes by the club, jackson transforms into a sports car and mows down several of mr. big's henchmen. the story picks up on the children at club 30's, and at first the children are afraid, but when jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the children find themselves back in the 1930s. the club is now filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers. jackson participates in a dance-off with the other club members, which serves as the music video for "smooth criminal". at the climax of the song, mr. big lays siege to the club and kidnaps one of the children, katie. jackson follows them back to big's lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen. mr. big appears and mentally tortures jackson by threatening to inject katie with highly addictive narcotics. while katie manages to just grab joe pesci's glasses and get free from being injected, mr. big decides he's had enough and orders his men to kill katie before finishing off jackson, but not before a shooting star flies by. jackson transforms into a giant robot and kills all of mr. big's soldiers. yup, ummm, you want more weirdness? watch the movie.moonwalker is fun for the first half hour, seeing michael's success and all his hard work really makes his fans appreciate him once again. is it mostly to hype up his album? yeah, i love how he spends the first 25 minutes praising how awesome he is, then we go to his song called "leave me alone", which is kind of hypocritical, not that it's not a great song, just a small turn of events. then when we skip the crummy acting, the story was incredibly weak: the villain spells his name out loud while michael and katie are spying on him, lol, michael is a transformer all of a sudden, the villain's big monster plan is to make kids high? also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make marvin the martian blush. but if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for smooth criminal. this music video is perfection, it's choreographing, it's setting, it's song, it's smooth style, michael always goes above and beyond perfection and smooth criminal was incredible. i loved moonwalker as a kid, i still watch it for fun to this day, but it's not the best movie by any means, it's pretty silly, but it's all good if you're a michael jackson fan as well.7/10

i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. some people were looking for a plot??? ok, when this video came out over a decade ago, i watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. it's not a movie. it doesn't have a plot, nor a central storyline. it's a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-form videos, all of them rather smartly or creatively done. michael jackson may be considered a freak these days, but, after all, this was the man who gave us thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with billie jean and beat it. with moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self-parody (the "badder" sequence). and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there, this video came out just a tad before he became a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances on film. and, imho, i think the smooth criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point!

it was on at 7:30am, too close to school to see very often. the animation & computer graphics were spectacular for the time. the idea of cowboys & ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles & robots was amazing. maybe it inspired treasure planet.unfortunately, it's really boring in the dvd format. the shows are all basically identical. when viewing non-sequential episodes on a dvd, you're stoned by disk #3. by today's standards, the animation is spotty. we don't notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead.the bright spots are the heroine characters. they were a lot more believable, took themselves more seriously than modern heroines, and weren't corny. they actually saved men.

though this series only ran a season, it has stayed with me for 20 years. it was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever. i would give nearly anything to have it on dvd or whatever format i can get. if you find any means of seeing this series i suggest you take full advantage. this series was the first one (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes. it also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them. heck the character goose actually scared me sometimes. he was just that odd at the time. also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of clint eastwood/tommy lee jones. if anyone has any way of contacting the creator/holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on dvd please by all means do so!!!

and i gave it a high 7.....why? because it bloody well rocked. at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys/games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. as others have said here it was ahead of its time. sadly this is why the show was doomed. they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far. i am hoping that more come out. how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out.. i don't know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation, and that imho is it's only flaw. the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition........ i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order... the dvds are good but i don't think the stories are in their proper order, but despite this the show rocked.

damn straight.....this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today. i can't wait to track down some of the dvd's to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. i've already introduced him to voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one)and i laughed my head off when he said to me one day "dad..you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid!!" how cool is that.come on hollywood, dust this one off and give it a live action attempt. couldn't be any worse than spiderman 3 was...man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.ok, i'll shuddup nowcheers

it has been 16 years since it's original run, i would have hoped by now some "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. i can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up. galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts.the animation was above average quality for it's time, and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today. it predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, this may have sealed it's doom too. i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available.

*spoilers*this is only the second pay-per-view i've given a perfect 10, the first being the 1991 royal rumble. it was full of exciting matches that weren't memorable, just disposable fun. and that's why i love it.the opening match between razor and dibiase, as well as ludvig borga vs. marty jannetty were the only low points. they were ok matches, but dibiase deserved better in his final pay per view match. these days, a match like this would have run-ins and a bigger climax for razor's first major babyface push. and jannetty, fresh off a intercontinental title run, could have had a better match with borga. but i don't think anyone really cared. they just needed a borga push on pay per view television.irs and the kid were great, as were michaels and perfect. i wish perfect could have won, but michaels lies down for no one. notice how right after this, he left the wwf so he wouldn't have to job to razor. bret hart had two great brawls with doink (notice how everyone's best match is against the hit-man) and then lawler. their rivalry was a classic; that's why that year's feud of the year was a no-brainer. how often do you see two legends win feud of the year this late in their careers?the steiners-heavenly bodies match was one of the best of the year. who knew the bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever?many say that the undertaker-giant gonzalez match was a waste of time. but i loved it. remember, what made the old wwf (as in, pre-wwe) great was the mix of athleticism and freak show. is there a soul out there who didn't like akeem?the main event wasn't bad, although nowhere near match of the year status. they put lex luger over well, but made a wise choice in having yokozuna keep the belt. he was the first heel since superstar graham to hold the belt for more than two months. nowadays, heels are champions all the time. but from the beginning of the wwwf through the wwf of the 90s, if you blinked, you missed a heel title reign.as an old school wrestling fan, this one and summerslam '88 are my favorites.

this was the first ppv in a new era for the wwe as hulk hogan, the ultimate warrior, ric flair and sherri martel had all left. a new crop of talent needed to be pushed. and this all started with lex luger, a former nwa world heavyweight champion being given a title shot against yokozuna. lex travelled all over the us in a bus called the lex express to inspire americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the japanese monster (who was actually samoan) and get the wwe championship back into american hands. as such there was much anticipation for this match.but every good ppv needs an undercard and this had some good stuff.the night started off with razor ramon defeating ted dibiase in a good match. the story going into this was that dibiase had picked on ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 kid on raw in july. ramon, angry, had then teamed with the 1-2-3 kid against the money inc tag team of ted dibiase and irwin r shyster. to settle their differences they were both given one on one matches dibiase vs ramon and shyster vs the kid. razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a razor's edge.next up came the steiner brothers putting the wwe tag team titles on the line against the heavenly bodies. depsite the interference of "the bodies" manager jim cornette, who hit scott steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they were able to pull out the win in a decent match.shawn michaels and mr perfect had been feuding since wrestlemania ix when shawn michaels confronted perfect after his loss to lex luger. perfect had then cost michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty janetty. michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against mr perfect, but michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard diesel. micheals and perfect had an excellent match here, but it was diesel who proved the difference maker, pulling perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for shawn to win by count out.irwin r shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night, easily accounting for the 1-2-3 kid.next came one of the big matches of the night as bret hart prepared to battle jerry lawler for the title of undisputed king of the wwe. but lawler came out with crutches, saying he'd been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he'd arranged another opponent for hart: doink the clown. hart and doink had a passable match which hart won with a sharpshooter. he was then jumped from behind by lawler. this bought wwe president jack tunney to the ring who told lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didn't wrestle hart. hart then destroyed lawler, winning with the sharpshooter, but hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision. so after all that lawler was named the undisputed king of the wwe. this match was followed by ludvig borda destroying marty janetty in a short match.the undertaker finished his long rivalry with harvey wippleman, which had started in 1992 when the undertaker had defeated wippleman's client kamala at summerslam and continued when wippleman's latest monster the giant gonzales had destroyed taker at the rumble and then again at wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over gonzales here. gonzales then turned on wippleman, chokeslamming him after a poor match.next it was time for six man tag action as the smoking gunns (bart and billy) and tatanka defeated the headshrinkers (samu and fatu) and bam bam bigelow with tatanka pinning samu.this brings us to the main event with yokozuna, flanked by jim cornette and mr fuji, putting the wwe title on the line against lex luger and it was all on board the lex express. lex came out attacking, but yokozuna took control. lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring. luger then attacked cornette and fuji as yokozuna was counted out. luger had won a fine match!!!!! balloons fell from the ceiling. the heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win. yokozuna may have retained the title, but luger had proved he could be beaten. the only question was, who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him?

i really liked this summerslam due to the look of the arena, the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason. anyways, this could have been one of the best summerslam's ever if the wwf didn't have lex luger in the main event against yokozuna, now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but i'm glad times have changed. it was a terrible main event just like every match luger is in is terrible. other matches on the card were razor ramon vs ted dibiase, steiner brothers vs heavenly bodies, shawn michaels vs curt hening, this was the event where shawn named his big monster of a body guard diesel, irs vs 1-2-3 kid, bret hart first takes on doink then takes on jerry lawler and stuff with the harts and lawler was always very interesting, then ludvig borga destroyed marty jannetty, undertaker took on giant gonzalez in another terrible match, the smoking gunns and tatanka took on bam bam bigelow and the headshrinkers, and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending. however it deserves 8/10

this game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. the city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of venom and carnage are appearing all over the city. who is behind these crimes? could it be doc ock? well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later spidey will unravel the mystery. the fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun. you get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. however, that is also a weak point. the swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky. you also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say spider-man 2 movie video game. still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story. so be prepared to see scorpion, rhino, venom, mysterio, doctor octopus, and carnage for one wild action packed ride.

if you played "spider-man" on the ps version, then you've seen it all. to truly experience it you should get the dc version. simply put it's a much graphically superior game; the textures are sharp, levels are easy to navigate, and it has much better sound then it's ps cousin. i bought this game back in late '00s and it still holds up even till this day. well, marvel: ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game. if you have a dreamcast, snag this up for cheap. the dc version is simply incredible.

rated e(contains violence).i had the original spiderman game for the pc for a couple of years now.i still have not beaten it because on windows xp there is a glitch on one level which i cant beat because of it.so be warned if you have xp.but for those who don't have xp give this game a try.its a fun clean family game with action and its great for any spiderman fan.in the game you play spiderman and you take on various criminals who commit crimes.spiderman is a fun little game and i recommend it to any spiderman fan or a parent wanting a fun,clean game for their kids.8/10

spider-man is in my opinion the best superhero ever, and this game is the best superhero game ever. while it may be somewhat easy, you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers, which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game. it may seem hard to control at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will be web-slinging like spider-man himself.the bosses, while like the levels are somewhat easy, are fun. the first boss, scorpion, is incredibly easy to beat, which shouldn't be so because as fans of the comic books know, scorpion is one of spider-man's most deadly villains. the second boss, rhino, is also very easy. the 3rd boss is venom, who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game, which definately shouldn't be. the 4th boss is venom again. this time, he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy. the 5th boss is mysterio, who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game. he is also one of the harder bosses, but once again, still fairly easy. next boss is carnage, who is, you guessed it, easy to beat. but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight. 7th boss is doctor octopus, who is like all the other bosses easy, but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield. the 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in a comic book or cartoon. i won't spoil it for you for those of you who haven't played the game, but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn't too easy. took me 4 or 5 tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries.all in all, a very good game. i gave it an 8 out of 10. the reasons why i didn't give it a 9 or 10 are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring (getting all that stuff will take a while though), it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show, the bosses are too easy, and they should have used hobgoblin and/or green goblin as a boss, i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air! they didn't use them in the sequel to this game either! well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider-man movie, so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie.

this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, spiderman improves in both departments. it also features the voice of stan lee, the creator of spiderman comics.as you'd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can. he does more than spin webs. in fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. when he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. spidey has his hands full as he battles venom, rhino, mysterio, scorpion, and dr. octopus to name a few. look for captain america in a cameo.most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. if you're a real marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. better luck in "spiderman 2." my evaluation: 9 out of 10.

an enjoyable game, which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability. staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today. also, the narration and animated scenes used (though lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the nintendo 64 version) use full advantage of the platforms' capabilities.

i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie....except when the bras and bullets started flying. i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone....but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep. i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat. if i'm correct ralph bashki did that movie too.it involves a cat that goes through hard times with family, streets,jobs , etc. when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out. because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter. ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt. heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.

ok, ok, don't get bent out of round. i was kidding."bustin' out" is actually a better and truer title anyhoo.racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our x-rated animator friend ralphie boy. and he does one of his better jobs here.on the crime front it shows the truth. they build it, defend it, then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to (maybe) lose it. see for yourself to see what goes down.racist? i don't know. with scatman (rip) and the love walrus (also rip) being black and the main point of view, i saw it as an attack on racism mostly. the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well. and the younger (pre "miami vice") phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise.it's an animated "blacksploitation" film. that's a good thing. done well and well done. it will make some squirm (like the lynching scene) but unfortunately that's based on fact.but ralphie really should have re-thought that title.

remember ralph bakshi? the guy that was an animator on terrytoons, then on paramount cartoon studios, after that, he was a director on fritz the cat 1 & 2 and heavy traffic? well, this is coonskin. and it's actually pretty good. racist, but good. the movie takes place in harlem nights (no, duh, it was a working title.) but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie, song of the south.it's about sampson (barry white) and the preacherman (charles gordone) rush to help their friend, randy (philip michael thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. while waiting for them, randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy (scatman crothers), as he begins to tell randy a story about "three guys, i used to know, just like you and your friends". pappy's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage.brother rabbit (voice of thomas), brother bear (voice of white), and preacher fox (voice of gordone) decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel. arriving in harlem, rabbit, bear, and fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be. they encounter a con man named simple savior, a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the "cousin" of black jesus, and that he gives his followers "the strength to kill whites". in a flashy stage performance in his "church", savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionrepresented by images of john wayne, elvis presley and richard nixon, before asking his parishioners for "donations".rabbit first goes up against madigan, a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes they're not worth it). when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, ruby and bobby, are led to a nightclub called "the cottontail".a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink. madigan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype, adorned in something racist, and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead.then, while recovering from his delirium of being drugged, shoots his gun around randomly, and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them.rabbit, bear, fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up. the live-action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops, but managing to make it out alive.this movie was controversial at that time of release, and was re-edited by the director several times under the title, street fight, which is obvious, since street fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets. in fact, this movie has the same subject as the documentary.that caused bryanston pictures, the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic, texas chainsaw massacre, to go out of business. because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but due to racism, bryanston took over bakshi's production.despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. the animation was awesome at that time, the plot makes sense, and it's actually funny too.final verdict: 9/10

by dane youssef "coonskin" is film, by the one and only ralph bakshi, is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life black in modern america (modern for the day, i mean--1975). paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame.but this is a bakshi film, controversial, thrilling, and a must-see almost by definition alone. not just another random "shock-jock" of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock. it's by ralph bakshi. anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something big to say...although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation, "coonskin" isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick. "coonskin" wants to be more. it aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish.the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre. nor does it just indict black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places."coonskin" tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break. the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the "coonskin" world alone makes it old-fashioned.one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear, brother rabbit, preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary. the itallian mob is running all the real action.big name black musicians star: barry white and scatman crothers, as well as charles gordone, the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer. something big is happening here obviously.the movie plays out like a descent into this world, this side of the racial divide. from an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand.bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "sublety." this one looks like it's never even heard of the word. but maybe a subject like this needs extremism. real sledgehammer satire. some subjects can't be tackled gently.bakshi is god-dammed merciless. here, no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed.the characters here are "animated" to "real" all depending on what the mood and situation are. the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally.bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value. he always has something to say. nor is black-face is gratuitously. here, unlike in spike lee's "bamboozled," he seems to be using it to try and really say something.like 99.9% of all of bakshi's films, this one incorporates animation and live-action. usually at the same time. bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here. all of this technique is all intertwined, meshing together while saying something.somehow, this one feels inevitably dated. many of these types of films (bakshi's included) are very topical, very spur of the moment. they reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back of them years later, there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth).even though the music, clothes, slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is. anyone who's really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about.even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a big ol' bear and a fox. one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these "dirty n-----s" after the death of a cop. but for him, it's not just business. nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks.the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, of which there are many. it plays out like an opera or a ballet.the promo line: warning: "this film offends everybody!" this is not just hype. proceed with extreme caution.you have been warned...by dane youssef

coonskin might be my favorite ralph bakshi film. like the best of his work, it's in-your-face and not ashamed of it for a second, but unlike some of his other work (even when he's at his finest, which was before and after coonskin with heavy traffic and wizards), it's not much uneven, despite appearances to the contrary. bakshi's taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race, of course, but moreover he's making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film; blaxploitation almost, though bakshi doesn't stop just there. if it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature. but bakshi's aims are higher: throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but italians/mafioso, homosexuals, jews, overall new york-types in the urban quarters of manhattan in the 70s, he isn't out to make anything realistic. the most normal looking creation in looking drawn "real" is, in fact, a naked woman painted red, white and blue.in mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism (i.e. the "tar-rabbit, baby" joke, yes joke, plus black-face), we're looking at abstraction to a grand degree. and best of all, bakshi doesn't take himself too seriously, unlike spike lee with a film like bamboozled, in delivering his message. this is why, for the most part, coonskin is a hilarious piece of work, where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and, of course, scenes of awkward behavior (i loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real-life white couple in tux and dress as looking "colorful" and the like), are just too much not to laugh at. it's not just the imagery, which is in and of itself incredibly "over"-stylized, but that the screenplay is sharp and, this is key for bakshi this time considering, it's got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madness.using at first live-action, then animation, and then an extremely clever matching of the two (ironically, what bakshi later went for in commercial form with cool world is done here to a t with less money and a rougher edge), pappy and randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape, and pappy tells of the story of brother rabbit, who with brother bear and preacher fox go to harlem and become big-time hoodlums, with rabbit in direct opposition to a jabba-the-hut-esquire godfather character. this is obviously a take off on song of the south with its intentionally happy-go-lucky plot and animation, here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is.yet bakshi goes for broke in combining forms; animated characters stand behind and move along with live-action backgrounds; when violence and gunshots and fights occurs it's as bloody as it can get for 1975; when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black-face and a dress, he trips in a manner of which not even disney could reach with dumbo; a boxing match with brother bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slow-motion; archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies, some and some from the 20s that are just tasteless.like mel brooks or kubrick or, more recently, south park, bakshi's coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thought-provocation second. it's also audacious film-making on an independent scale; everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters (however all based on the theme of the piece) all serve the thought in the script, where its b-movie plot opens up much more for interpretation. to call it racist misses the point; it's like calling dr. strangelove pro-atomic desolation or confederate states of america pro slavery. and, for me, it's one of the best satires ever made.

mpaa:rated r for violence,language,nudity and brief drug use. quebec rating:13+ canadian home video rating:18ai saw coonskin today.this film is also known as bustin out and street fight.after watching fritz the cat,i wanted to see more of bashki's films.i saw cool world and thought it was mediocre and i saw this.when it was first released, the film was very controversial.it was considered racist and al sharpton wanted the film banned, he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing.the film was only released on vhs under the title "street fight".it is now considered a cult-classic film and african-american celebrities such as comedian richard pryor,director spike lee and the rap group the wu-tang clan are said to have enjoyed this film.i personally thought fritz the cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well.worth watching for bashki or blaxploitation film fans.the film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film who framed roger rabbit.i would have preferred it in full animation but whatever.the film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison.while the prisoners wait,the older one tells a story of three men he knew.the film then switches into animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man.they decide to make names for themselves in harlem.so the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in harlem and he basically becomes a big shot.the film moves on as the italian mafia want him out.the mafia involves the godfather,his three sons who are homosexual and an italian clown.coonskin is an entertaining animated film that's worth checking out, if you can find it.

after finally watching walt disney's song of the south on myspace, i decided to watch ralph bakshi's response to that movie-coonskin-on afro video which i linked from google video. in this one, during the live-action sequences, preacherman (charles gordone) takes his friend sampson (barry white) with him to pick up pappy (scatman crothers) and randy (philip thomas, years before he added michael for his middle name professionally) as the latter two escape from prison. during their attempt, pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit (voice of thomas), brother bear (white), and preacher fox (gordone) and their adventures in harlem. as expected in many of these bakshi efforts, there's a mix of animation and live-action that provides a unique point-of-view from the writer/director that is sure to offend some people. another fascinating animated character is miss america who's a big-as in gigantic in every way-white blonde woman dressed in skin-tight red, white, and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me! there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bear's frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me. there's also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a "cockroach" she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman. i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jr.'s version of "ain't no sunshine" heard as part of the score. most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the n-word in a satirical way. when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago, it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan, "this movie will offend everybody". that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children. that said, i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation.

i had watched this film from ralph bakshi (wizards, hey good lookin'), one night ago on www.afrovideo.org, and i didn't see anything racial (i am not stupid), i do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today, but i think it's a satire and a very,very urban retelling of the old uncle remus stories that the black american culture, created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to "the tar baby" and "the briar patch." these aren't bigoted stories, mind you, but cultural icons created by black americans, and me being a white woman read and love those stories. and i also found it an interesting time-capsule view on the black culture in harlem, new york in the 70's.well to get to the nitty-gritty of this film: this film is a live-action/animated film, which begins in live-action with a fellow named sampson (barry white) and the preacherman (charles gordone) rush to help their friend, randy (philip michael thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. while waiting for them, randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy (scatman crothers), as he begins to tell randy the animated story of brother rabbit, a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of harlem; you know, to me rabbit,bear and fox are animal versions of randy,sampson and the preacherman. an abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage, the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s  racial, ethnic, and otherwise.so anyway, it is another good bakshi movie; and should we sweep films like this under the rug? pretend they never exist? hmmm...i think that would be a shame; i think we should watch these films entacted, and learn about what goes on back then, just how far we come since then.

streetfight (aka coonskin) is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer ralph bakshi. it is an oddity of the cinema, and is very much worth seeing. it is live action mixed with animation, seemingly influenced on disney's legendary song of the south, almost as if it is a response to that flick. philip michael thomas, later to become don johnson's sidekick on miami vice, and scatman crothers, most famous for his role in kubrick's the shining, are prison escapees. charles gordone and barry white (yes, that barry white) are thomas' friends and plan to help him escape prison. they are stuck at a police roadblock, and crothers tells thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear, and a fox who move from the south to harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence. the story is animated, and provides a lot of wonderous things to see. like all of bakshi's films, most will be annoyed and will dislike the animation. true animation lovers will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its inventiveness. the movie is very violent, very sexual, and it is mostly about battles between the races. for a long time, i thought i was watching something extremely important, but after a while, especially after i got done watching it, it started to seem more like a run-of-the-mill blacksploitation flick, along the lines of superfly. it's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything. besides, isn't bakshi white? whatever the answer to that, coonskin/streetfight is still very much worth watching for animation aficionados as well as cult movie fans. 7/10.

one of the most interesting movies to be classified as "blaxploitation," bakshi's "coonskin" is a rich text full of wonderful insight. he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white, who appear in the film as well. the racist imagery can often be disturbing, but the message of the movie was so powerful that the naacp gave it an endorsement (but only grudgingly).i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct. wonderful stuff.

street fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. this is not a movie you just watch for fun. it is not a comfortable experience, although it does have some laugh-out-loud moments. this is a movie you watch when you need food for thought.to dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely. this is not only a satire of song of the south, it's also a biting commentary on the prejudices that americans still have as a society. every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. through this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightly-held beliefs really are.if you're the sort of person who's willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices american culture still holds, and if you're not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye, this movie may be for you.

i found this movie to be exciting right from the start--like a spielberg movie is--and found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual situation was.right from the start--before the opening credits-- the action starts, bringing with it immediate suspense.the two main characters are very likable. (i have trouble liking any of the baldwins, due to alec's extra-curricular, political activities, but william was not too bad in this movie.)there were several highly unexpected twists, which contributed to the enjoyment.there were, unfortunately, many places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack--something like 19k hz. i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set.

sorry to say i have no idea what hollywood is doing. sure give us movies like batman begins. oh, by the way hollywood i think they may cover the story line in the movie batman, but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see batman and superman together. i really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more. i was looking around to see when it was coming out. it was like a terrible practical joke. the graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie. unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. to the producers, directors and all the actors great job but i hate you for doing this to me. you left me wanting more.

after seeing the terrible, terrible, terrible batman: dead end i knew i had to see this as soon as i heard about it.pressing play to view the trailer i thought i was in for another hideous short from what so-far looked like another bad wannabe film-maker trying to bring new depth to an existing character. but was instead greeted with a greatly put together trailer for a movie that sadly doesn't exist, as i would love to see a finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes long.world's finest makes up for batman: dead end and then some.i look forward to the next short!

i've just seen it....for those who don't know what it is, i suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing it...it's kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short batman dead end, but this time besides the black knight there is also superman... it would be wonderful if they made the entire movie...but i'm afraid that it's almost impossible, especially just before the official batman 5 film.-- there is no greater crime against peace than the refusal to fight for it.lorenzo 'purifier'pinto

after seeing the "batman dead end" short, i didn't know what to really expect from world's finest. of course, superman and batman. all my world's finest comic books have them as the team-up.after seeing this 3-and-a-half minute trailer, it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for world's finest, if not an actual full-length film.sure, some of the superman stuff was cheesy, but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers, giving you only certain aspects of the entire product. this looks like it needs a complete product.other than director sandy collera's relative playing an achingly poor perry white, most of the actors were unknown. if an actual movie was made, actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film, though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane, especially if given closer-to-the-character dialogue.good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end, but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s-90s leather cape and cowl. his demeanor is batman-like, but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask. i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona.michael o'hearn cannot play superman, period. he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says, "slap me." and line delivery seems to be a problem with him.overall, though, i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work. there was a rumor about a world's finest movie being made, and with the correct additions to the script, this could be it. hope more like this are made.

another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman:dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. the attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions "other" superhero related movies. here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. finally, a superman that actually looks "super" and looks like the real thing! batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver. i just wish that some sensible warner bros. exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel. i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd, i would never get tired of watching it. just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this. hope the "bigwigs" at marvel & dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look. no more "batman & robin" fiasco, or hulk, daredevil, etc. learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie, just to have it "bomb" in theaters. mr. collora...we need more directors like you!!

batman and superman. iconic. the better part of a century old. who doesn't know of these two? there must be countless of fans who would die to make a film about them. sandy collora went ahead and put together a trailer for such a film(which does not exist, and is not being created, much less by this team). perhaps what this has most going for it is how polished it is. throughout, the cinematography is solid. the editing is spot-on. the production values, even with the costumes looking more like their comic counterparts than the ones of the feature films featuring these character, are quite high. it looks quite "hollywood", this trailer. the physical types fit for, as far as i can tell, every single character. the lines are reasonably written. the shots are well-thought up, nicely achieved and fairly effective. however, this does have problems, and in spite of looking good, it doesn't quite match the energy and skill of grayson(which only had the problem of teeter-tottering too much back and forth between a short and a trailer, as well as unbridled passion leading to the inclusion of too many characters and ideas). the acting is perhaps the most evident. it's... not good. even some of those who only have one line and/or hardly appear on-screen at all manage to fail at delivering a good performance. the actors cast in the parts seem to have been chosen more for how much they look like the characters they're playing than their talent. then there is the writing. really, the plot, well, what minuscule amount there is(this and this character team up, something about some evil plot...) is fine. there is a problem in the characterization. while most characters seem to fit, two-face is, well, about as much as a cackling lunatic(which is quite simply, as far as i've understood, not what the character is) as he was in batman forever(and having your work on portraying any element of the batman universe compared to joel schumacher's efforts can be considered the greatest insult to a fan). also, putting that character in this is going to cause comparisons between this trailer and that film(honestly, collora is practically *begging* for it with such a similar initial reveal) to be made, and, let's face it, this loses in every respect. michael antonik most definitely does not possess the screen presence that tommy lee jones does, and the make-up(which, in aforementioned reveal, is essential) isn't as strong as that of the film(whether or not it was good in the film is another matter). the sad thing is that while fiorella(john, who created grayson) seems to be far more into the comics, and get them, the depth of them, better(not to mention possessing more of an ability to come up with compelling plot... grayson had enough material for half a dozen feature films, or more), collora seems to be the one with access to funds and the one who's more likely to have contacts(on account of having non-indie credits on his filmography) to actually have a shot at making an actual feature out of his trailer. i intend to watch other of collora's work. but fiorella is the one of the two whose work i will most definitely be most interested in. i recommend this to fans of the characters. 7/10

13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint. the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively, the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith (davy crocket) and lorne greene (sam houston) were too old.raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle. the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand. failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military. santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry. raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene.kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. however, kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron.

this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance.obviously,the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment.it's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along.i won't go int to the storyline here.but i will get into the acting,which is terrific.everyone is well cast.the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters.the same filmmakers that made batman: dead end and grayson also made this short film.of the three,i probably liked this one the least,but i still thought it was well done.for me,world's finest is a 7/10

this is a fan-made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs batman and superman! it's the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like comiccon and was made by the same person who made batman: dead end, sandy collora.as far as this film goes, i could easily pick it apart. sure the cgi effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. but, this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible. i was particularly impressed by the very buff superman--he was no wimpy little guy! if only this were a preview for a real film--they'd have fans lined up from here to omaha to see it. great job.

i really liked batman: dead end, i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film. this trailer didn't quite give me the same impression. the story line, or potential story line, was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show.first, michael o'hearn is not that good a superman. i actually thought he, in his brief appearance, made a decent clark kent. sorry, i just don't think of superman as being that buff. the suit kent wore masked his size. batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman. supes is toned no doubt but not bulk. anyway, i didn't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy. now this may not be just o'hearn's fault, collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction.second, the special effects for flying were cheezy. superman flies through the sky. if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground, with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him. i don't think there were any full body shots of superman flying. evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso.all in all it was a good trailer. i'd probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. the story line, an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries, superman jealous of lois's attraction to wayne, lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman & superman is a good one. i'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company, even o'hearn could deliver a decent film. certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately.

this film is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of the comic book. the sets, the costumes, and the plot is great. clark bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a bit better in dead end, but he still pulls it off. superman is great too. the flying effects are ok. but its a fan-film so we cant expect them to be the greatest. the shot with superman catching the car was very believable. it was cool. this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real. its got every thing you would want in a batman/ superman movie. one exception though, i would cast the joker instead of 2-face..... overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film.

i'll say this to begin with:...why, oh why, can't wb do what these short film directors do? sandy is obviously an amazing director, and deserves some credit from wb and dc. but i guess they're kinda put on edge when a man with a $12,000 budget can make a super-hero fan drool. the world's finest is one of the best short films i've ever seen, trailer or not.i think choosing a bodybuilder(mike o'hearn) to play superman was a genius choice. let's face it people, superman is no super-model. he may be handsome, but a gq stud he is not. and i don't know what that guy a few comments above me was on, but superman is actually pretty beefy(have you ever actually read a superman comic?). i guess that fact alone just floors me...it seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual muscle-mass to play a super-hero, rather than a pretty-face. same thing for batman, bartram is in incredible shape, and an excellent batman...i don't know guys...if given a bigger budget, and his own movie...i think bale and bartram would be neck and neck. bottom line, this is one of only a scant few of super-hero movies with actors that actually look the part.the acting is pretty nice as well. i don't know what every one is talking about, o'hearn isn't that bad. he's damn convincing as superman, and bartram...well, he is batman. i mean, come on people, this movie had a $12,000 dollar budget, what were you expecting?. everyone else is great too, except two-face seems a tad crazier than usual...but hey, we only have tommy-lee jones as a reference. oh, lois is pretty hot too.the sfx are flippin' sweet too. i mean, seeing superman lift the car up...man!, how cool is that. versus the "tank" scene in grayson, i may have to put this one above that, since mike actually looks like he's flying, and with ease. the flying sequences left something to be desired, but once again, with a bigger budget...oh, and he even used a batmobile!(it was probably a model, but it looked damned convincing).all in all, this trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget. and wb refuses to admit that collora is a credible director, and needs to be apart of some kind a project...but no, they'll(like most of the marvel projects) just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about, and keep churning out these gamble movies. thank god superman returns was a hit, or that seriously would've been the end of it. world's finest is excellent, and in my book, counts as a superhero movie.

let me make one thing clear.for the most part, the mentality of those who run the show in hollywood frankly p*sses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved, iconic characters from the pages of comic books. why? well let's take a typical hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall we..executive no.1 'hey there's lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days.' executive no.2 'good point, let's make one with haste then!  we'll do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon!' (the dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out) executive no.1 'great! now who can we get to play the part?' executive no.2 'who's a big box office star at the moment?' executive no.1 '*name of big actor* is the in thing this week.' executive no.2 'but does he really suit the role? i mean he doesn't resemble the character whatsoever.' executive no.1 'who cares?! he's a big name; we'll make the film with him in it anyway.' executive no.2 'you're quite right! and besides we'll fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anyway!'the above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons i generally loath most modern superhero movies. all style, no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads. of course to be equitable, there are exceptions to the above rule; when hollywood does get it right  take the casting of the original (and still easily the best!) superman; christopher reeve and more recently patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen in the x-men films.but back to the general negative traits displayed by hollywood today..wouldn't it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually suited the roles? well in this less than ideal world, one filmmaker does just this believe it or not, by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts. his name is sandy collora. sadly (but typically) hollywood has not as of yet allowed collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us, he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two (as of yet) famous super hero short features. one is the superb batman:dead end and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called worlds finest.well, let's not mince our words here  this is absolutely awesome stuff!the casting of mr. universe winner and male model michael o'hearn, (who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster barbarian) makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel. in fact, in terms of physical resemblance, there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic character.added to this clark bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the dark knight in batman:dead end; again, yet another hugely judicious piece of casting!what can i say?  if only this was indeed a real, full length film! hollywood studio executives  take note! this is how it should be done!as a final note, i am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans. tellingly, the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more (as similarly with batman: dead end) from a younger, less cinematically experienced audience; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction. such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in hollywood, will no doubt derive great satisfaction from. after all, these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of cgi addicted, popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that hollywood churns out by the deluge these days.

"world's finest" is an unique project. it's a trailer for a superman/batman crossover movie that doesn't exists and will also never exists, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors and plot line anyway.so the movie is one big tease, even more than standards everyday real movie trailers. the trailer will hype you all up for nothing. in that regard, i really didn't liked this short project. when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad- and perhaps you'll even feel cheated afterward, when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all. sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place. surely to show off sandy collora's skills but couldn't he had also done this with a real movie short, like his earlier movie "batman: dead end".but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is, so from a movie technical point of view, it's a really great one. it's great looking and way more professional than you'll perhaps at first would expect, although the people who've already seen "batman: dead end" will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets, cheap homemade costumes and third-rate actors. the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget wasn't sky-high but for most part it's very impressive and professional looking, with nice costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting.the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up, with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey, it works well for the trailer style. it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones, mainly the superman flying sequences. it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car, with a camera aimed at him from an angle below. i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch. but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this.michael o'hearn seemed like a pretty good superman/clark kent, although he obviously isn't the greatest talented actor around. clark bartram reprises his batman role well again and kurt carley seemed like an awesome lex luthor. the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough.it's especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie, in the movies "batman begins" and "superman returns". it's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one. it's actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt carley does sound like kevin spacey, the actor who played lex luthor in "superman returns".it's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more, even though you know that there won't be more. whatever happened to the waner bros. plans to create an actual full length superman/batman movie by the way? i thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since. instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made; "batman begins" and "superman returns".7/10

when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville, texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction. as long as that stands, we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen. one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this century.but i would say the alamo: thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed i've seen. john wayne's film is a good one if over-hyped, but it's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne. brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was.it's a lot closer to professor lon tinkle's book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that. tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the result.alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner. back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that. one thing that was not explored and hasn't been was travis's hyperactive sex drive. he was the casanova of the southwest, he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests.but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie, played here by james arness. he was a hero at the alamo to be sure, but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel. he was a smuggler, a slave trader, an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to. but his heroic death certainly redeemed him. no hint of that is in arness's portrayal nor any others i've seen of bowie on the screen. and of course he did design the bowie knife, done to his specifications. that man needed such a weapon.however the main asset that the alamo: thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna, the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans who've come to settle in texas at mexican invitation. unfortunately those americans came with some pre-conceived notions about liberty that just hadn't made it that far south, at least liberty for white people. raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history. he was also quite the scoundrel, but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came along.this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston. greene's not quite my conception of houston, he really was way too old for the part, houston was in his early forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of texas. but within the limits imposed on him, greene does a fine job.for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john wayne's version, but for historical content i recommend this film highly.

this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective, more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events, though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston, bowie, travis and crockett.the focus here is on jim bowie, played with sharp, cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85. then 65, he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part.puerto rican-born raul julia humanizes gen. santa ana as no one since j. carol naish back in '54 had done. however, the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous, vainglorious popinjay--gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since. he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but, convinced of his own infallibility, he does not heed it.alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays: col. william travis. his portrayal is earnest. he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him.the one jarring note was brian keith as crockett. in a coonskin cap and carrying ol' betsy, he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie. with no conviction in the portrayal, the character is reduced to a few stage conventions. the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions. we learn that jim bowie was, in the person of santa ana, fighting his own brother-in-law. the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier. "santa ana likes a bargain." bowie wryly explains. the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill- advised--a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "the alamo".

the best film on the battle of san antonio, texas in march 1836, was john wayne's 1960 epic the alamo. in a one shot job as director producer, that temporarily financially strapped him, wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the west.i have commented on that film in a review the other night, and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant (the screenwriter) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle. they did bring in the issue of slavery. they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett, bowie, travis, austin, and houston. but there was one weakness (though well hidden) in the film. wayne worked hard to cast it properly, thinking of many people for lead roles in it. but, he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces, general antonio de santa anna. the role was played by an obscure actor, ruben padilla (on this board, his thread shows only three credits listed). padilla did not have any spoken dialog (even in spanish). and while he does have one of the last shots in the film, he just is shown as a silent tyrant, observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their allies.despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie (the alamo: thirteen days to clory), it is the best film in showing the man who was (from 1836 to 1854) a leading bogeyman to american policy makers. raul julia was a wonderful stage actor. i was fortunate to see him in a production (in the late 1980s) of arms and the man in manhattan, as sergius. he was never boring, and usually first rate in his acting.here we see the egotistical monster at his worst. nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa anna's wishes or activities. it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough, or it can be the temerity of these "foreign brigands" (as he saw the americans) in not knuckling down to himself, "the napoleon of the west".santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855. he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the country's constitution, but it was the power that kept him going year after year. it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades. no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s. initially he claimed great liberal ideals, but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves (and thus he sounds like gilbert roland in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose ferrer). the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back. his policies were disasters. while we know about his attack on texas (to put down a revolt there), he also tried to expand into guatamala (and probably saw himself controlling much of central america). he did win at the alamo, but at great cost of lives. his massacre of col. fannin's men at goliad was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the alamo who were fighting to the last, but fannin had surrendered). then came the disaster of san jacinto, where his army was wiped out (he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the american troops). he was captured, and humiliated, and forced to sign a surrender of texas. houston was kind to him: the troops wanted to string him up.except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838, he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars. he repudiated the forced surrender of texas, but could not militarily undue it. instead, he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 - 48 against the americans, leading to the mexican session. the u.s. was "decent" enough to pay mexico $15,000,000 for the southwest, but mexico lost half of it's territory. he would be president for the last time in 1853, in time to give franklin pierce's horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory - santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico (the "gadsden purchase") to the u.s. no other mexican president (not even porfirio diaz) ever cost his country so much (diaz did sell out to foreign business interests, but he built up mexico's economic muscles doing so). he was exiled in 1855, and settled in staten island. there he managed to do his most creative work: he introduced chicle to the u.s., and it became chewing gum. some achievement! julia's santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america's best land purchase agent. he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment's notice. most of the time his chief aide, col. black (david ogden stiers, here a british born officer) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be. but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss. at the end, when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders, stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like. and they did!

heres a fun fact, i was the baby in the movie, the one in the crib. :) i am 19 years old now. my parents took me to try out for the part, we lived in texas at the time.i think i only made like 80 bucks for it, but i wasn't in it very long. my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry. i was all mixed up. strange and funny fact i suppose.. and no i am not a child actress. i am livin' in san antonio, workin' at a walgreens. i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life. this movie is a great movie, though, good concept. i have seen it several times in my short 19 years.

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting. the writing was top-notch. james arness is a great actor and he showed it here. brian keith was too old to be davy crockett, and can anyone really play davy but fess parker?another great actor in this move was raul julia, who gave depth to santa anna, a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent times.while some may think the movie was slow-paced, it captured the battle as it unfolded, lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror.what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in. in this day and age when nobody stands for anything, i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time.

super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. the imax camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix (if only that would appear on dvd!). i enjoy watching it again and again.the only minus, and why i didn't give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up. the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges.

sure, for it's super imagery and awesome sound, it's a great home theater "show off" disk, but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. the parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. young, old, boys and girls alike will find that deep down, we are all fans of the automobile, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. the mark knopfler and ry cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content. i don't want to give away the ending, but the final driving sequence to quincy jones' "days like these" just might bring a tear to your eye. enjoy it!

this is a well-made documentary on the exciting world of indy car racing. the photography is simply outstanding. the scene were mario andretti drives the old racing roadster down the new england street lined with the ancient maples, leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car, is incredible. the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film.

this is an excellent documentary, packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story. the imax cameras give you a very wide perspective, as a dvd movie it is perfect. your hear every speaker working almost all the time, the film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph. of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good, they give a depth to the driving scenes...

this is a great documentary film. any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film. director "stephen low" did a great job,as well as the main stars of the film, father & son, mario & michael andretti. the dvd looks & sounds amazing. and best of all it's imax! great home theater test disc.

i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. the musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production. even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system.the subject is also so fascinating. it is about mario andretti and his son michael. i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship, f1 championship, the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500. the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son. the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection. the other car is michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season. imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating.paul newman, who was michael amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made, narrates the film. his anecdotes and witticism, drawn from many years as an owner and driver, lends much to the production.the main feature is the race scenes. turn up the volume here! there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget. wow!the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family. this god of the racing world, mario andretti, is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career. they work together so well that every father and son should see this. you can tell that they are a close family. i wish we could all have that experience.

only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and character design of this movie. superior ancients that dwell in the lands of lore far beyond any average human creature's understanding. this movie pulls the adventure genre into a unique centrifugal magical force of fantasy unto thee mystical crystals of chalice. stories come and go, but the idea for a good story is to think positive, not negative thoughts. to create a good versus evil battle like never before. embracing an impounding shimmering process that keeps imagination glowing in one dimension and out the other. striking a quick flash of energy that transports a human to another world.

wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince (simon) who is banished from his kingdom due to his father (the king) being killed by the cliche "evil adviser". this movie's about simon's adventures. the special effects, plot, acting, and generally everything about this movie is bad. however, it's so bad that it's funny. you will keep watching this movie simply because it's so bad it's funny, and, like the other reviewer of the movie said, it's so bad it's good.

i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie.it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990.a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment.winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors,drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television.i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure.it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever.we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish.we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect.it is a true gem.the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever.if you see this movie for rent in a video store,steal it.you won't regret it!

this movie is horrible- in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way.the storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind, that i'm not going to even bother describing it. it's a sword/sorcery picture, has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil aide/sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature....you get the point.the first time i caught this movie was during a very harsh winter. i don't know why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel, but when i caught site of gulfax, i decided to stay and watch it until the end.gulfax is a white, furry creature akin to chewbacca, but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch. he looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the actor to wear it. there are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot move within, or that he's almost falling over. although he isn't in the movie that much, the few scenes are worth it! watch as he attempts to talk smack to bo svenson, taking the solo-chewbacca comparison's to an even higher level! i actually bought this movie just because of that character, and still have it somewhere! gulfax may look like sh!t, but he made this movie!!! the only reason i've never seen the sequel, or even sought it out, was because of his absence! perhaps should there be a final film, completing the trilogy, gulfax will make a much-anticipated return!

when i saw this movie first, it was long ago on vhs-video. i did like this movie, because it was funny and excitingly. some years ago i saw another movie, called: *andy colby's incredible adventure* in this movie were parts of *wizards of the lost kingdom* used in. they called this movie "kor the conquerer". i began to search for the "kor"-movie many years, because i wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the *andy colby*-movie. no shop had this kor-movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. many years i watched my old vhs-tapes i had at home, and what a wonder... i had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles. so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching *kor the conquerer again. the music is great during the hole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest. the music in the background had some kind of magic. i like bo svenson, and also the boy, who played simon in the movie. both of them did their job very good. manfred kraatz, germany, 26.10.2004. thanks to all for reading my comment.

although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, i am ashamed to say i rather like it. not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham! video, so it is most definitely worth a viewing (£0.79 a night in my local store!). watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume, the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following: evil wizard-type bloke: "at last we meet kor..." kor: "thrilling, isn't it?"amazing!!i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film, none of them actually happen. no, i'm not joking...there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird, it's just trying to make you interested...classic in my opinion. this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value!!

brian dennehy, bill paxton, joe pantalino and, best of all, jeff fahey, all in one film. wow is all i can think to say about that. these are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together. it's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film.the film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time, and the four stars help the re-watch-ability to a great extent. i cannot describe how good it was to see bill paxton and jeff fahey together on screen, the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves, it almost brought a tear to my eyes.a good film, a great cast, go see. why? four words, fahey, dennehy, paxton, pantalino.

i was pleased with the cast of reputable players. the story is one of standing up for a cause, even if you are at personal risk in doing so. in a time where violence and pain are often in the movie forefront, this movie focuses on the old fashioned good cop. although similar plots have been done repeatedly, these guys pull it off well. kick back and enjoy. dennehy is a master of taking over a movie.

i saw this pilot when it was first shown, and i'm sure countless "spirit" fans hate it, because, like batman, the green hornet etc., it took the character in the direction of "camp". but i evidently never got enough of batman, because i thought it was entertaining, in some of the same ways as that show. there are two parts that stay with me. first, when denny's partner has been fatally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law, and obeying the exact letter of it. then, he says something like, "boy, was i stupid!" which is his way of telling denny to become a vigilante instead, which he does (though the tv batman kind). then, there's the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her, but she isn't fooled, because he's too honest to kiss her convincingly ! this was a great example of "camp", that was also "underplayed", by both the actor and actress.

the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series. however, spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced. i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit (sorry) of the comic with a modern twist. i'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series. sam (flash gordon) jones was a perfect spirit. nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trek:deep space nine years later. maybe with the release of frank miller's big-screen version of the spirit, more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history. it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars. when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro, we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd, such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s (although all copies i ever saw were badly edited). heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon.

the adaptation of will eisner's spirit to the tv screen followed many other offerings developed from comic strip pages or comic books. (remember, the two aren't exactly the same medium) it is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation (as of the time of this writing)of eisner's smart alec, wise cracking, tongue-in-cheek super hero.story has it that republic pictures was interested in doing a film version and was in negotiation with the copyright owner in the mid '40's, but they were never able to close the deal. the left over screen play became the serial, the masked marvel, one of republic's best. perhaps that it was just as well, for that studio had a penchant for tinkering with material adapted from the comic strips, pulp mags, radio and the comic books.as for this 1987 made for tv movie, it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. whereas an old, long time comic reader,like myself, can be a little harsh in criticism of an adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be able to give some fresh observations, clear of any preconceived notions of what this screen version should look like.well, while sitting and watching the story unfold, with the characters interacting amid some crime wave, the little lady (my wife, mrs. ryan) nailed it with one statement. "this can't make up its mind if it's serious or not!" that pretty well describes both the spirit and his creator, mr. will eisner, the true creative genius in the comics.the film is a sincere attempt to put eisner's world on the screen. the casting of denny colt/the spirit, commissioner dolan and ellen was really quite well done. though in a contemporary setting, it was still in the tradition of "the good old days" as far as the costuming goes, you know, when men and women still wore hats! that brings up this one final (and meandering) point, and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a will eisner look as far as facial expressions and body language. we say,kudos to them for their efforts.it's just too bad that no series followed! oh, well in today's motion picture world, comic adaptations seem to be a hot item. maybe some big timer producer and director could do a really 1st class spirit production for the big screen. we can only hope.update: dateline, chicago, illinois. 6/4/2008. by now, everyone who goes to the movies at the shopping centre multiplexes has seen the poster advertising the new film of the spirit, (subtitled, my city screams); which is to be released christmas day, 2008. well, we'll see then just what we've been talking about. just keep your fingers crossed! to be continued.............update ii: we saw the new film, writer-director frank miller's rendition of the spirit a couple of days ago. well, we got our wish; but is this a good thing or another case of "be careful what you ask for; because you may get it?" please read our write-up elsewhere in imdb.com. thanx!

who would've imagined -- hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. the fusion is highly entertaining.having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade, i approached this one with some caution. his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. the director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of long island, new york or in new york city itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". to my pleasant surprise, hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. it works in more ways than one might imagine. hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana. truly he is coming into his own. the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley's vision and style. fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before.

fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley's henry fool. i haven't seen the earlier film, and i don't know if that's a good thing or not. i can only regard the current film on its own merits.for most people, hal hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like or you don't. his combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humour really resonates with me, and fay grim is no exception. it has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud. for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. it's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes.during the second half of the film, the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller. whether this was hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear, but i think a bit of editing or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum.the performances were generally good, particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum, who had the most screen time. saffron burrows, james urbaniak, carl montgomery and elina löwensohn all played good support roles. the film's visuals were nice (set in new york, paris, berlin and istanbul) and the music (also by hartley) was good without being intrusive. the film is well-written and i enjoyed this it immensely. if you like hartley's earlier work, you'll probably like this.

it seems hal hartley's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences. this film will be no exception to that rule. fay grim acts as a sequel to hartley's 'henry foole' from 1998. the focus this time is on henry's ex wife (played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey), who is being pestered by cia goons about henry's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings. in the interim of all of this, fay ends up on an odyssey,dealing with international spies,etc. the film does get a bit bogged down in the second half. if you've been a fan of hal hartley in the past, this is one not to be missed. for the novice hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique, you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one (especially if you haven't seen 'henry' yet). i admired the camera work,which at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography.

i've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to henry fool, and even though it technically is, i think that fay grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film. just because it is the sequel doesn't mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first, and i enjoyed that so much about it. the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first, which makes sense because the movie isn't called henry fool 2, it's fay grim. all that aside, the film, i thought, was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me. i was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story-line (aka parker's last direct to video feature the oh in ohio) but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn't seem so, which i absolutely loved. there are so many nuances in the film making and writing that i crave to see in films, but never do. the cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'grim' throughout - in terms of setting. the writing was so well put together as well, whoever said this movie isn't as witty as henry fool needs to watch again and actually listen; i almost can't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was, and pertinent. and well, parker posey, who could complain? the scene in which fool and jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional. and i thought the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on (in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost). the main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film, and i believe the point of the film, was parker's love and naivety about fool, which was so endearing and turned, yes very quickly, from denial to outright passion. the last five minutes of the film were perfect. obviously there were things that weren't excellent, but nothing is perfect; some of the acting was poor, and at times i did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand, but in the end you got it and didn't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension. (this may also have to do with goldblum's tendency to talk extremely fast) on the whole i would say that it was probably one of the best films i've seen this year; stylistically pleasing, clever and witty writing, performances that were so impressive i now have gained new respect for some of the actors, and a truly touching film, and don't forget, a complete departure from fool. which was the point.

generically speaking, fay grim is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most inexorably enjoyable names in american movies, unshakably beautiful and gracefully spunky parker posey and endlessly charismatic and unavoidably hilarious jeff goldblum. they have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two insatiable presences volleying off of each other, even radiating with charm when goldblum rolls off hartley's shamelessly epic info-dumps. nevertheless, if one were to deconstruct fay grim, one would see many instances in which countless scenes could've been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in being.this sort of filmed in-joke is the sequel to hal hartley's henry fool, which was made ten years earlier. it has title character posey forced by cia agent goldblum to track down the notebooks that were the precious possessions of her missing fugitive husband, the predecessor's titular anti-hero. available within them is information that could concede the safety of the united states. fay first makes for paris to get a hold of them but becomes engulfed in a bona fide celebration of espionage clichés featuring everything from car bombs to ambiguous helpers to following the girl to double-crosses to triple-crosses.the primary appeal of it all for me is that it's such a novel approach to the sequel of a movie about a garbageman and a struggling novelist in a small town. in the original henry fool, posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life. hartley's talents do not reach the heights of many of the other independent newbies from the 1990s, but i do admire his wild creativity in making an inadvertent nearne sister out of her, giving her a terrific predicament, as he did to her character's brother, played by james urbaniak, in henry fool, as she is trapped between whether or not she may still love her overwhelming refugee husband and the problematic but forceful plans of goldblum.hartley, however, is simply riding on that fragmentary idea. his plot, though complex and labyrinthine, true to the form of the spy film, it seems as if to be entirely capricious. the reason i was not bored was mostly due to the pace at which the story unfolds, not to mention the presence of posey and goldblum. the problem with the remainder of hartley's cast is that i cannot seem to become fond of the rest of them. it has nothing to do with how obscure they are compared to the relative star power of the two said charm masters, but with how they don't seem to hold their own alongside them, though saffron burrows certainly comes close. most of the scenes not involving posey or goldblum are far too light on their feet, stringing us along with info-dumps we have no choice but to listen to or else be totally lost in the ensuing sequence of scenes. they are shot almost entirely in tiled angles, as if hartley is compensating for that implacable feeling of a lack of material.liam aiken, however, playing the now teenage son of fay and henry, has a certain allure about him, seeming wise beyond his years, certainly much wiser than any of the adult characters. perhaps hartley intended that, or maybe it's simply aiken's presence. the problem with a hartley film is that you never quite know what was intended and what just happens to be there. as scorsese said, "cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out." one has to be able to trust that what we see is a conscious decision by the filmmaker to remain in the finished film.

henry fool surprised me. i didn't expect it to entertain and amuse as well, or as strongly, as it did. fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it. once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, however, it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film. at least as good as ginger snaps back, if not better.i am a little disappointed that jeff goldblum's part is so small, but i'm happy he is a part of this short run. he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright. also a delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim, the son of fay and henry.this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons. i am pleased, for example, to discover that henry isn't really the loser he seems (by the end of fool), and to further discover that he is, in fact, a genius...well, that really is a lovely stroke of the pen.i am hoping they do a third...like the end of the trilogy. it seems to be missing. they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father, to validate the awesome change in his mother, and the sense of near-genius he himself feels welling inside him. assuming, of course, that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son, concerning his father. it feels like it needs to be done. i'd buy it.even with more action, this is still not an action flick. it is more drama and intrigue...a mystery, of sorts. i'll watch it often.it rates an 8.3/10 from...the fiend :.

after seeing this film months ago, it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and i feel i must buy it or at least see it again, even though i watched it at least 3 times when i rented it at that point.i fell in love with hal hartley's directing many years ago - i found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained. it is a strange feeling, granted, and i assume most people out there really just don't get it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - i guess i just really get it - its as if these films were made for me.although i don't remember if i actually laughed out loud during this film, it remains one of the funniest films i've seen in many years. if you don't see the humor of the grocery bag fay carries from the street to a church, to her brother's publisher's office, to her son's principal's office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film. the bag is a silent character in itself, being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash, bitchy parker posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her.i consider "henry fool" my least favorite of hartley's films. i honestly don't remember it very well - i think the character himself was so despicable i found it tedious. hartley's forte seems to be feminine character development.aside from posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see elina lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. her extravagant naiveté is perfect for hartley's direction. his ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout.this film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story, explaining political situations in afganistan. this is never suspected at the beginning. the complexity of this film's development is unparalleled.this is the epitome of a "stand alone" sequel. the less you know about henry fool the more mystery is spun around him, the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-smoking complaint machine, hurling insults at his islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him. its like finding out santa claus is actually a 12-year-old schoolyard bully.although i was impressed and satisfied with hartley's other recent films "the girl from monday" and "no such thing", "fay grim" goes far beyond what i expected, with a sense of humor and originality no oscar winner would ever dare.

fay, the sister of the notorious nobel prize-winning smut poet simon grim, still loves henry fool. their son receives an ingenious orgy-in-a-box from an undisclosed sender and a chase across three continents ensues, involving a supremely sad-sack collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants, and bellhops.parker posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance, including some brilliant physical work. with strong contributions by jasmin tabatabai and saffron burrows, fay grim proves in the best billy wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble.another good score by hartley (and thanks in the credits to the american academy in berlin, where hartley served as a fellow in fall 2004).

fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film. it has all the pieces of acting, direction, storyline, and entertainment value. they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece, fay grim.this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing. soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henry's. these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings. fay is sent to find these journals, in return to release her brother from prison, and is sent on a cat-and-mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about.parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show. she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers, but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies. posey made me believe what was happening on screen, i felt for her, i rooted for her, and i wanted to know more. she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her.i haven't seen any other previous works by writer/director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was.if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i'd highly urge you to choose fay grim. if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely.

i'm one of those people who'd crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film. from trust and iris to henry fool and (my hartley favorite) no such thing, hal's unique brand of movies are an acquired taste. infusing equal parts mystery/espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte. the comedy isn't in your face necessarily, and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition. and that's the case with fay grim, the sequel to henry fool.parker posey stars as fay grim, abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to henry's only son ned. fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen. his name is fulbright (jeff goldblum, man of the year) and he wants henry's notebooks. there are many henry fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings. apparently there's much more to them. secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists? who knows but henry. agent fulbright tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly surmised as a ruse to get fay out of her home and searching for henry (and it works ...but not the way they think).fay battles multiple spy rings to gather henry's notebooks and to seek him out. she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon (james urbaniak) out of prison (he'd helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film.) multiple overlapping events occur in rapid succession: spy rings shoot each other to death, henry is discovered being held in "safety" by a jihadist, fay frees her brother but unknowingly risks her son's life, and the cia gets its comeuppance for putting fay in danger.hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes. and he does so to the extreme here. even character names (grim, fool, fulbright, fogg) have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny. the over-the-top espionage films of ol' are given plenty of screen time, too, as guns blaze in stop-motion sequences, never striking our heroine even though she's right in the line of fire.now that i've heaped praise on this creation, i will say that parker posey's excessive portrayal of fay grim isn't the best part of the film, which is a shame considering how much time she's on-screen. i realize this was probably what mr. hartley wanted: an uncurbed woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme. but it was still painful to watch at times.even so, fans will probably devour fay grim and beg for more. though this wasn't my favorite hal hartley film, i know i'm ready.

as someone who has seen and followed hartley's public work for several years i think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind games.while entertaining, fay grim is another step in the henry fool line of thinking, where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself. in henry fool, the object is the memoirs... in fay grim, the object is encrypted memoirs - which are themselves stolen, forged and trans-mutated into something so obscure it can't really make any sense - i.e. the process of script writing and film-making in the modern era - where most blockbuster films are little more than a mash-up of the past. that is, in a philosophical sense, what fay grim is all about. the object, perhaps, is the tragedy that shock is now cliché and dull (as hinted in the opening scenes at the publishers office).that being said, many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand henry's character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for. henry is a thinly veiled devil, first visiting simon as a modern faust, etc. without understanding how tragic henry's character is, much of the quality of fay grim's plot and story is lost.and there is not enough 'detail' expressed through verbal flashbacks - knowing the plot of henry fool cannot compare to 'feeling' the quality of the characters as one did in henry fool, and so i think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of 'so what' responses to highly constructed dialog and then that's it.however, henry fool was also my least favorite hartley film until i realized that it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because henry fool's confessions were bad... not just raunchy or dirty, but inescapably broken. henry can not even be a proper villain - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing... like gollum in tolkien's works, henry is pitiable.that doesn't come across in fay grim, although henry's dialog is excellent. what does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption - a sort of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to henry's confessions. it is an interesting twist, but one that can't really be digested without viewing the first film. perhaps showing more of henry earlier on would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic storyline of the first movie - although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about - unless perhaps one is a casual observer.part of the encryption? hard to say... a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though. cheesy.

henry fool is a better film. but this is the perfect way to follow-up a film like 'henry fool.' to take henry very seriously, his 'lies' and his mysterious aura. even the opening shot of 'henry fool' when simon puts his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through 'fay grim.' the over-the-top jokes, that are more or less meta-jokes (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them. also hartley's use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring, yes, it's intention, but it feels forced and over-used, it goes beyond jarring to, what i'd like to call, annoying. it's a flawed film, but a must see for any hartley or 'henry fool' fan. and don't listen to stupid reviews, don't watch this unless you've seen the first film. the intrigue, satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven't seen henry fool. it's a sequel. that's just dumb.

hal hartley's henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work. it has immense character depth, subtle, complicated dialogue, and an excellent, emotional ending which captivates. i remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what i was seeing and feeling. henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish, and needed no sequel.thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim. fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of real-world vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he matures. in her own movie, fay matures herself, though her maturity takes a very different road. simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhat-introverted genius. fay starts her adult journey as an immature, utterly normal, spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature, utterly normal, experienced adult who holds no advantages. she deals with problems the way any human does, with determination, a little thought, and weary disdain. while simon learned to control his mind, fay learns to control her emotion.the movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel, but differs vastly in tone for most of the film. henry fool showed you a harsh, boring, ignorant world which contrasted with simon's inner passion and creativity. in fay grim, the world is a lively, crazy, emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life, and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak mother.the movie is in two parts, the first dealing with the beginning of fay's struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility, and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain henry. at first, fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel, and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy. but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies. the sequel is about fay's journey, and as i said before, hers is one of finding the life-giving sanity in chaos, not the creative chaos in staid order. parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartley's tongue in cheek humor perfectly. elina löwensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role, allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively, stage-like comedy happening around her.with the entrance of henry into the picture, the movie begins to take a sobering turn. hal hartley's movies are all plays, and every play must come full circle. by the end, you are shown fay's newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense henry, whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets.fay grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass henry fool, but shows through hal's range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius.honestly, i think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile (and especially the subtlety in parker posey's acting), but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool.

when i started watching "fay grim", i had no idea that it was a sequel to "henry fool". now, the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel. but one has arrived, and it's quite good. i assume that you've seen the original, so i won't explain it. this one starts with fay (parker posey) living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry (thomas jay ryan). simon (james urbaniak) is still in jail. one day, the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. but this is no ordinary toy. it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than "syriana".i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here. maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality, but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world. and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel.also starring jeff goldblum.

a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels. parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. the story is very tongue in cheek, and the dialog skillfully understated. hints of humor and intrigue, neither of which overpower the characterization posey pulls off so well. the supporting cast is stellar. the downside? this film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body. she's worth your time, even if you don't understand the denouement.

perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasn't so attached to the characters in henry fool. to those who've never seen henry fool, i wouldn't worry. as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff, the film has lots of exposition and explanations.this film is very heavy in plot, which keeps the film moving. there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartley's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue. over all, a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work. as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur, this film could go either way. i have mixed feelings about the film and hartley's later films in general. what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations, focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other. since his late 90s and onward, his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter. mass media in no such thing, religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim. i don't know if hartley's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he's able to do it justice.strangely enough, the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships, a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves. the only problem is, i've seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film. you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel. somehow, the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henry's books of confessions as a macguffin (in the hitchcockian sense). fay's motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool.i guess i'm slightly disappointed in the film because it's not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesn't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller. there's too much irony and wryness in hartley's approach to such as big topic as terrorism. it somehow works and doesn't work at the same time. all i could say, you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartley's work and how well you know hartley's work. fans of henry fool, be severely warned for a disappointment. for the rest, welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride.

convoluted, infuriating and implausible, fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. she's at once touching,funny, cunning. the supporting actors commit to it as well.i wont even try to tell you the plot.. it involves characters from hartley's henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage.the film works well if you continue along with it-understanding it is. in a sense, completely ridiculous. it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along. (i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice).fay grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that isn't cookie-cutter. in the end, it offers something that defies description.

i'm an admirer of hal hartley's films, especially 1997's "henry fool." "fay grim" is a sequel to that film, and has a similar style and sense of humor. the plot, however, is completely different. fay grim (played brilliantly by the iconic parker posey) tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks, and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage. the supporting cast (most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum, saffron burrows, and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling elina lowensohn) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises. the director claims this is part of a "star wars"-like trilogy, serving as the "empire strikes back" of the series if this is true, i can't wait to see the third installment! i just hope i don't have to wait 10 more years for it.

i just saw this film @ tiff (toronto international film festival). fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed!! and if you are not familiar with this director's oeuvre ... doesn't matter. this film can definitely stand all on its own. i have to go the second screening ... it was amazing i need to see it again -- and fast!! this film is very funny. it's dialogue is very smart, and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim. fay grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool (2000). visually, the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted (or dutch) angle, which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts, available in the possible films: short works by hal hartley 1994-2004 collection, and in the girl from monday (2005).i viewed this film most aptly on sept 11th. textually, fay grim's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after september 11, 2001. without going into major spoilers, i view this work, and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely, if ever, foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore (cf. syrianna: of side note - mark cuban exec. prod in both these films ... most interesting, to say the least). lastly, for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool, simone, fay and henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential. that being said, the character of fay grimm starts off in the film, exactly where she was when henry fool ended, but by the end of the film ... fay's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative. what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family ... ?? i can't wait for the third part in this story!

the 1997 low-key indie dramedy henry fool would seemingly have been a secure choice of movies no one would bother to revisit for a sequel. a rumpled, dissipated drifter (thomas jay ryan) strolls into town. his anarchistic rantings and delusions inspire a nerdy garbage collector (james urbaniak) to write poems, while henry half-heartedly tries to boink the guy's sister (parker posey). as the poet prospers, henry declines. nothing special about any of the characters or the story. a pitch for harold and maude's ghost would have been quoted higher odds of ever making it to a screen.but parker posey ain't the semi-official queen of the indies for nothing'. so when writer/director hal hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a film was born. though we catch up with the same characters many years, they're in a completely different sort of dark comedy; this one's laced with espionage! henry may have been an international spy - and possible double, or even triple, agent - for years before meeting the others. he's either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries. everyone wants his rambling, incoherent journal which just may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies. posey's fay is either the wife he left to go on the lam, or his widow, depending on who's telling the truth. fay's efforts to find henry and/or the hotly-contested journals include a globe-trotting gauntlet of multinational hit-persons and henchmen at every turn. she never knows who to believe or trust. nor do we.while herding these unlikely characters into jason bourne/jack ryan territory, hartley's script retains the ironic deadpan humor of their first appearance, steering clear of slapstick in exposing them to physical menaces. his sly lampoon of the paranoia, duplicity and musical-chairs alliances of today's geopolitics starts to crumble towards the end. even so, fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of hartley's recycling methods.

when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool, i was excited (it's been a personal favorite for years now), and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism. having just seen it though, i was surprised to find that it worked, while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool. the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb...especial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast, right down to henry's son, who was only four in the original. like i said though, this movie is quite different from the first, but it works: i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended. in this case, an unexpected adventure ensues...and that's about all i'll give away...not to mention the fact that i'll need to see it again to really understand what's going on and who's double crossing who. while it was certainly one of the better movies i've seen in some time, it suffers like many sequels with its ending, as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging. i'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ('henry grim'?) in 2017.

fay grim is, on its face, a tale of espionage and intrigue told with a nod and a wink. as the sequel to his extraordinary henry fool, hal hartley creates a surprising blend of film noir and hardboiled spy thriller that starts with a knowing smile and large dose of laughter and turns as poignant and warm as any film i've seen this year.parkey posey is fay grim, an unwitting mata hari caught between the love of her exiled husband henry fool and the questionable intentions of a charming cia operative. as agent fulbright, jeff goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm, in a role that seems tailored to his talents. he has never been better. james urbaniak is fay's brother simon, jailed but renowned for his wildly popular books of poetry. his love of his work and his sister brings a jolt of passion to contrast the dour nature of the spies which eventually populate fay's world. and liam aiken is fay's oversexed 14 year-old son. although that may be redundant. aiken's understated style is remarkably "old soul" for someone his age.the entire film is shot dutch angle, the off-kilter style made famous by orson welles and used primarily in horror films and psychological thrillers to impart a sense of foreboding. in fay grim, using that style from opening credits to closing is intriguing at first, deceptively clever the next. for just as the viewer begins to fall for the perfectly timed comedic elements and wit of hartley's brilliant script, something happens. the film takes a dark yet strangely comforting turn as these characters magically become sympathetic before our eyes. what began as dark comedy morphs into romantic drama, and the transition is masterful. slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action, and we are sucked right into the vortex.in the end, hartley's sharp dialog combined with the amazing performances of a perfectly matched ensemble cast makes for a delicious cinematic cocktail. told with the luxury of one able to write, produce, direct, edit, and even compose the music, hal hartley has crafted a smart, sexy tale of espionage with tongue just barely planted in cheek. fay grim is one part dashiell hammett, one part raymond chandler, and one part ian fleming, shaken and maybe stirred as well.

carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance! the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going. the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them. although the story isn't strong, the action is fun and draws you to the very end (which i felt could've had a sequel).campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu!!

a pleasant surprise! i expected a further downgrade along the line: the rock (9)-->con air (7)-->armaggeddon (4). especially for such an overhyped film. perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare. clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it. fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. this is one for the more intelligent action fans. it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little.

the movie was a big car commercial. :-)but who cares? i went to the theater to view the shelby cobra, angelina & cage.so i guess it was a good movie. *bg*

i liked this movie. it was pretty cool. it has it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. it does not excel in any of this things, with the exception of the cars. a bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and lot´s of car, with a great chase near the end. the jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible, so the movie ain´t as bad as people are painting it. it has some quality, and i liked to watch it. in fact, i loved the film. and i didn´t need to turn off my brains to watch it. i wasn´t always thinking "is this possible?" or tramp like that. 9 in 10.

i saw once no man's land (1987) - imdb link http://us.imdb.com/title?0093638 - and found it ok. the film is about a guy who steals only porsches. gone in sixty seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it. in fact, it has a lot of scenes that are worthless. and the ending is very, very bad.the sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used...

i really loved this film, yes, i know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together. cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy, he was a little "too" much don't you think? anyway, great film, great cars and great acting. i for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night. :)

i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night. i didn't really hear much about it. so i wasn't expecting anything. but after i saw it, i really liked it. nicolas cage and the rest of the cast were very good. but i do have to say giovanni ribisi's acting performace did need a little perking up. but such a small flaw, it could be overrided. gone in 60 seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. the movie is in no way predictable. so the ending should be a suprise. think it's just another, fast car driving movie? well you are partially right. there is much more to it. everyone should take a look at this movie.

the story is quite original, but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars. its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too, but the actual stealing should've been more in picture... however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see (7/10)

weak, fast and multicolor,this is the valvoline's movie in fact you can see always this brand of oil in a lot of scene. the real protagonist are the cars,weak performances of cage and duvall. a intresting angelina jolie is a unlikely mechanic. for the lovers of dream car(lamborghini and ferrari over all).

good action and interesting plot. having seen the original i must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie. good cast .. meaningful acting.. although it would nice to see some more expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story. fun movie to watch and keeps you alert all the time 7/10 is a right vote i think!

i saw this on a flight over to the u.s and was a little sceptical at first as a few people had said there were so many characters in it that you didnt get to know any of them. however i didnt find this at all. the film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. the chase scenes are excellent and yes it may be predictable but isnt that true of most films. the main villain is a bit of a let down, christopher eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but that said its still a good film.

it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old, fast, or exotic cars. it has a plot and a lot of action. the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene. all of the other scenes are great. i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well.

if you like cars you will love this film!there are some superb actors in the film, especially vinnie jones, with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance.the others are not bad either....there are only two slight flaws to this film. firstly, the poor plot, however people don't watch this film for the plot. secondly, the glorification of grand theft auto (car crime). however if people really believe they can steal a ferrari and get away with it then good look to them, hope you have a good time in jail!when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role, i first thought "...sweeet.", but then i thought "...naaaa you suck!" but then finally after watching the film i realised "...yep he suck's!".only joking he plays the role very well.i'll end this unusual review by saying "if the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death carries with it an inherent nobility. and a supreme glory. we should all be so fortunate. you can say "poor criminal." i say: "poor us."p.s. - angelina jolie voight looks quite nice!

i have had the chance to watch several movies in bluray and hd dvd. this movie stays to it's wonderful action and great story. although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it. not having this movie on dvd helped make the purchase easier. i have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don't always go together. overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch. now on the blu ray scale. in many blu ray movies you either get two things. a picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture. i was disappointed when i made this my first blu ray movie. i almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard. although after watching other movies i know better. i don't believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd. that is generally the problem with some movies. and for the price of blu ray players and the blue ray discs you should only have the best picture. so i only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version.

nick cage is randall raines, a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he's forced to save his the life of his brother kip (giovanni ribisi) when he screws up on a job, by completing his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night. he has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch. but the cops are onto him, so can he pull it off? this was one of the great candidates of a film to re-make as the original was far from a classic. and if you don't go into it expecting much, and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is. you'll end up enjoying the ride. watch it on a double-bill with "the fast and the furious" for a night of high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards.my grade: b- dvd extras: 7 minute jerry bruckheimer interview; bruckheimer bio/filmography; action overload: highlight reel; the big chase; "0 to 60" featurette; "wild rides" featurette; stars on the move; the cult "painted on the heart" music video; theatrical trailer, and trailers for "shanghai noon", "mission to mars" and "coyote ugly"

as much as i like big epic pictures - i'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces. films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. there are hundreds of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones.it's an update of the movie that shares its name. it also shares that picture's ethos, but not quite it's execution. whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget. often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug-ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, sixty succeeds.the plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write imdb about. often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will voice it with different inflections. a lot of people found this annoying; i find it raises a smile. each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here, with cage, jolie and duvall leading the pack of course (and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here). the chemistry between good ol' saint nick the stalwart (see date of review) and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments.the villain is not even a little scary - i've seen chris eccleston play tough-guy roles before so i know he can handle them, but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action. we know the heroes are going to succeed, somehow; we're just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in-cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating. in fact, i wouldn't have minded some fourth-wall breaking winks at the camera: it's just that kind of movie.all this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed *just* so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. and for the most part, it is. wonderfully so. i've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast-cut extreme close-up shots to direct action these days. i personally find this kind of thing exhausting. i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time. i've been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance (in real life i mean - his character clearly doesn't care) and it shows. the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow-burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and fun - way possible.so yes, this movie isn't an "epic, life-affirming post-9/11 picture with obligatory social commentary" effort. the pacing is uneven, some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. but car movies rarely come better than this. so if you hate cars... why are you even reading these comments?!i'd take it over the numerous iterations of "the flaccid and the tedious" (guess the franchise) any day. 7/10

to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip (giovanni ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total). he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order'. the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of randall (nicolas cage), a retired' booster and also kip's brother and a couple of old friends of randall's. as you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was. of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story. you are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the hot stuff, since there are only 50 beautiful, fast, cool and expensive cars to be stolen. well the other hot item in this film is sway (angelina jolie (who will be a big star (trust me))). she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft, but she is pretty hot too. ok not hot as in pretty, but hot as in damn cool and sexy. she was very believable in this role, probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too (don't believe me, read her biography) and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man. i only know, that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film, because she is not too mainstream, a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo.ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes. hey but after seeing the whole film i must say: who cares. why must i say that, well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars; one cool, wild, sexy lady (yes, i mean mrs. jolie) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  feelgood ending.as for nicolas cage, well he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock, con air, face / off, snake eyes and finally this one. plus what actor has had so many good action / thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? well no one!!! maybe jackie chan, but he is one of my favourites too. one thing that is true though about mr. cages bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. the rock, was a clear 9, con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. not that that mark is bad. does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? no it doesn't show us that, because almost all of cage's films were successful in the last few years, except for 8mm and bringing out the dead. 8mm was not great, i admit that, but that was never cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. about the latter film i can not say anything, cause i have not seen it yet. one thing though i know for sure, if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, i would have said yes to all of them. i would have said yes to the rock, because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris. i would have said yes to con air, because there would be a lot of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with john malkovich and ving rhames. in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big paycheque, i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie (can't wait to see her in that lara croft outfit). this one was a good choice of mr. cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10

what's in a name? if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action.in producer bruckheimer's latest film, gone in 60 seconds, its all about the nomenclature. with character monikers like kip, sway and the sphinx and cars idealized with names like diane, sue and the elusive eleanor, it's only the non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game.not a deep script by any means, but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as memphis raines, along with angelina jolie and robert duvall, comes out of car-thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. a remake of the 1974 cult hit, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining.surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting. although loaded with stars, none of them have standout performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers, giovanni ribisi. even jolie, coming off her recent oscar win, is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film? i think so. the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling. just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre.3 1/2 out of 5

gone in 60 sec. where do i began, it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars. people say its not a good movie i disagree sure it has some cheesy parts but what action movie doesn't. i gave it an 8 out of 10 cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the rock or face off than this movie is right up your alley cage dose a good job along with one of the most under rated actors in my mind del-roy lindo. i think sometimes people look to far into movies some times you need to sit back enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself did they achieve what they where showing. meaning if they where going for action was it action pact. if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they? i think they made the action movie they set out to make, give it a chance and you wont be sorry.

gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over $100 million but got blasted by most critics. i personally thought this was a great film. the story was believable and has probobly the greatest cast ever for this type of movie including 3 academy award winners nicolas cage, robert duvall and the very hot anjolina jolie. other than the lame stunt at the end this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (out of ****)

gone in 60 seconds / (2000) *** (out of four)	"gone in 60 seconds" is an energetic, slick, stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles. if you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer jerry bruckheimer ("con air," "the rock"), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride.	the film stars giovanni ribisi ("the mod squad") as a young crook named kip raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal raymond calitri (christopher eccleston). when kip's life is threatened because of such, his older brother, randall "memphis" raines (nicolas cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days.	memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. the crew includes sara "sway" wayland (angelina jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing memphis through previous business, a fellow named mirror man (t.j. cross), the aging and wise otto halliwell (robert duvall), as well as tumbler (scott caan), atley jackson (will patton), toby (william lee scott), and donny astricky (chi mcbrde). 	contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, roland castlebeck (delroy lindo) and drycoff (timothy olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.there is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. to make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. i am not stating i think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish; i actually honor the director's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an r-rating. however, i do believe in a movie such as "gone in 60 seconds," to strongly develop the character's enlightenment, dialogue needs to be believable and authentic.  in spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, perfectly cast performers responsible. nicolas cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. angelina jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. delroy lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. giovanni ribisi, scott caan, robert duvall, will patton, and christopher eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles.	the film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. in the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. while the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot, not a whole lot happens. the third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.	the soundtrack to "gone in 60 seconds" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. it is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. dominic sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in "gone in 60 seconds" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitementbut not much more.  

this movie has taken a lot of stick. it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cage's career. the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "bruck-buster" action at its best. fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. it has everything: ferraris, mercs, a hummer and lets not forget eleanor! i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! then again maybe that's just me!

night of the twisters is a very good film that has a good cast which includes devon sawa, amos crawley, john schneider, lori hallier, laura bertram, david ferry, helen hughes, jhene erwin, alex lastewka, thomas lastewka, megan kitchen, and graham mcpherson. the acting by all of these actors is very good. the special effects and thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. the movie is filmed very good. the music is good. the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. this is a very good and thrilling film. if you like devon sawa, amos crawley, john schneider, lori hallier, laura bertram, david ferry, helen hughes, jhene erwin, the rest of the cast in the film, action, mystery, thrillers, dramas, and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today!

this movie is good for tv. i like it because i'm a huge fan of disaster films even though this is a family film. accuracy on the film from the book is half-and-half they got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser, the the car scene involving the hatch family running away from the tornado wasn't in the book instead it involved dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety. and in the book dan and his friend are both 12-years old. thats all i can think of. overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book. did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small nebraska town in 1980?

i just got this video used and i was watching it last night. the acting started out extremely bad (hey------hey------twister) but got very good soon after wards. the tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like twister. the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. the story was very well written, and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old "disaster formulas" movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years.while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality, this merits an a in my book.

this movie has some things that are pretty amazing. first, it is supposed to be based on a true story. that, in itself, is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall-in nebraska. i wonder if the real town's name was close to "blainsworth" (which is the town's name in the movie). there is an ainsworth, nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with blains-something.it does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house. on the other hand, the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact. before doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel (not on cable) and tuned the brightness just right, you could tell if there was a tornado coming. the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it. since i know something about midwest tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. i enjoy it more than twister. i mean, give me a break-there is no way you could make it through and f5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house.

well , i come from bulgaria where it 's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be "very , very afraid"!!!this guy (devon sawa) has done a great job with this movie!i don't know exactly how old he was but he didn't act like a child (well done)!now about the tornado-it wasn't very realistic but frightens you!if you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is the movie!

ok, so the fx are not high budget. but this story is based on actual events. not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer!! as most movies that are based on books, there are somethings that just don't fit. only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events, not a knock-off as most people believe it is!! this movie is in no way related too twister! other than both movies are about tornadoes.for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember... the actual "night of the twisters" was june 3, 1980. so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events. try think how far storm research has advanced in that time. it happened in a larger town; grand island, nebraska is the third largest city in the state. even though the movie calls the town something else, and says it's a small town. for the real story check out: http://www.gitwisters.com/

i've had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for more than 40 years, since my 5th grade teacher, a native texan, told stories of ones he saw in his youth. fortunately, i've lived my whole life in the middle atlantic states, where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as the ones in the midwest, but i have had two close encounters, one in pa and the other in nj, in the past decade.i enjoyed the family scenes, particularly the conflicts between jack and dan hatch. when the tornado was close, dan knew most of what he had to do, and he probably learned this in school, since i know that tornado safety is an important subject in parts of the u.s. where these storms are more frequent. however, characters in the movie did two things that some people think are supposed to be done or are safe to do in tornadoes but are actually not supposed to be done or are unsafe.when the siren first sounded, dan and arthur went through the house and opened the windows. for years, this is what people were told to do, but tornado safety web sites now advise against doing this. also, people were shown hiding in a highway underpass. this method was made popular by an early 1990s video made by a t.v. crew during a relatively weak twister in kansas. however, in the most serious tornadoes, people can be sucked out from these underpasses. this happened during a may 1999 outbreak in oklahoma.the tornadoes in this movie hit in the fall, which is not a common time for them to happen. (then again, one of my close encounters took place in late september.) also, they traveled from northwest to southeast, while most such storms in the northern hemisphere go from southwest to northeast. however, this is not all that unusual. a famous tornado that struck joliet, il, in the early 1990s traveled in that direction (as did the one involved in my other close encounter).i think that the movie should have been set in the spring. this movie was based on a book that in turn was based on an actual event that happened on june 3, 1980. but it was still a compelling story.

granted i had seen some "speed racer", but i never really watched it and i had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five. this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it. it actually ended, the bad guys done in unlike nearly every american cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformers that ended with galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the autobots, dungeons and dragons with the kids never making it home, with gi joe with cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth. this one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. as it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one android 16 used against cell in dragonball z, then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out. then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. he would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called bobo in america. the villains not only consisted of dr. hell, but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head. interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion.

i was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series (heidi, barbapapa, il etait une fois l'homme..., most of which i love). i find that other similar japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match mazinger z, as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern.that very thing, the novelty, may be one of the best features of mazinger z. another good point is its inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and bizarre characters; actually, we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us!

"atlantis: the lost empire" was everything the previews indicated it would be. it is not often you find that. most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. not so with this one. i was pleased with the original plot, even though the sub-plots were not. the animation was not break through like "shrek" but it was good, none the less. the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them. this keeps you interested. i found myself enjoying this one. "atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. you also have to think a little bit, but not too much. once you think about it a little, you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don't know for sure how it is going to happen.the casting was also good. michael j. fox, as milo was an excellent choice. his personality fits nicely. the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner. his character reminded me of his performance in "maverick" which i also liked. i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair. her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting. it's just too bad she is a villain.over all, definitely worth you while (8 out of 10).

this highly derivative film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime films. i enjoyed most of it, especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the better bits of animation). james garner as the commander and leonard nimoy as the king give impressive performances.

that kid a is such a babe; this movie was no titan a.e.(of which it is in many ways modeled after) but still came off as entertaining, the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb raider makes wanna cry; includes some of the most entertaining characters i've seen in disney film

while there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, and walt & roy did in their eras with the studio. if you thought think "the castaways" or "the island at the top of the world" weren't identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon.

i loved this movie! i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan, but i really enjoyed myself. the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going! this is a bit of a departure for disney, they don't spend quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out)and there are no musical numbers. it is strictly action adventure. i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney, be they young or old.

to my surprise, i really enjoyed disney's latest animation installment. the film had its lows, but overall i felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. it was also pleasant to see an animated disney film that was not a musical. i was about pushed to the limits with tarzan. thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.one disappointment was the animation. with all the great animated films happening outside disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little. there is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of atlantis! overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.

ok, after reading a couple of reviews on atlantis: the lost empire, i just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from nadia: secret of the blue water. the only part that was a ripoff from nadia is that the pendant from nadia and the pendant from atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. if you want to consider how kida and nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against disney too(it was kind of wierd for nadia and kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too). as an anime fan i have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in laputa, the ancient mask from princess mononoke, the resemblence of the vehicles to the garfish submarine in nadia, etc)...the plot itself i believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that disney can pull it off without the use of captain nemo(the main character in jules verne's 20k leagues under the sea which is also the main character in nadia). as for mylo and jean wearing similar style glasses...as shown in the novel "lord of the flies", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. i think mylo, jean, the main character from stargate and a dozen of other "intelligent" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. as for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what nautilius does), i want to state that it's a required element for either one if atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). as for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from nautilius in nadia, it might be the artwork but i don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. as an anime fan that rated nadia as the #1 best anime i ever watched even now today. i do have my doubts about atlantis when i first saw the preview. but now that i watched the movie, i once again regained my confidence with disney and have high hopes for their future movies after atlantis. overall, the best disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (i was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)

beautiful to watch, but what would be the first thing you would do the moment you discovered atlantis? explore it! here was a golden opportunity to take viewers someplace special. instead, disney reverted to the same old formula story telling.

atlantis was much better than i had anticipated. in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age. although this film did demand a soid attention span at times. it was a great film for all ages. i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure. i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies. after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis.

atlantis was much better than i had anticipated. in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age. although this film did demand a solid attention span at times. it was a great film for all ages. i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure. i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies. after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis.

while i have a great respect for disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what i would call "must-see". atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations.atlantis is a more "mature" disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering. the world of atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. the presentation of simply atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. the inclusion of an atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well.also, with the exception of some scenes involving mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a "childish" element that i usually associate with disney films. instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis, as milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. part of this involves the atlantean "weaponry", which is used in a very action-packed climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting.granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the toy story movies, this is the most entertaining disney film i've seen in years.

if you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue, and imagination - without the need to break into song every twelve minutes - then this is the disney movie for you! my sons loved every minute of this film, and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie. there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right. this should go down as one of the disney "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement!

atlantis is probally the best disney movie that i have seen in years. it has great action scene, magic, an intelligent and weel written script. atlantis, brings back the magic of the disney classics such as "the lion king" or "alladin". after seeing this one i'm sure that this year summer blockbusters season will be great.i recommend to you all, "alantis : the lost empire is like a breath of inspiration.9 out of 10

atlantis: the lost empire has some of the best, smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i've seen. and i was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. i especially love don novello's voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet. too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first act. one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which atlantis doesn't provide. he's average at best. halfway through the movie there's a mediocre twist. that's all. it's a great movie nevertheless. everyone should check it out.

the movie "atlantis: the lost empire" is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently. parents who have had to sit through "the jungle book 2" or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one.the film is one of few to attempt at an original story; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories. films such as "toy story", "finding nemo", and "monsters inc." all do the same, but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney. recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video, and are sequels to an existing successful film. the quality of those films is given way to the profitability. a new era started with "atlantis" following it were "mulan", "lilo & stitch", and most recently "open range". the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past.a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. including that of young milo thatch, voiced by michael j. fox. milo is employed by a museum in washington d.c.. his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis. this was seen as a waste by his peers, and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps. after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition, milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment. she takes him to her employer, a mr. whitmore. whitmore was a close friend of milo's grandfather, and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis. mr. whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything. the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch. the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis. the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis, not just the discovery of people. it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience.the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation. the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images. a feat not easily achieved, most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two. the characters are believably human. there are some nice chase type scenes, with lots of action going on. a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get.the creativity of the writers really shines through. the culture of atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources, such as plato. the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained. believable, if by a younger audience, that magic really does exist. the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic, but can best be described in this way.although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic. the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo's nautilus, complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes. the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology. the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been, even holding roles in leadership. this is not a bad thing. it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to, rather than an all male cast.one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song, ever. a tradition that began with the first feature film, "snow white", and carried on through to "the lion king", almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs. this is great and all, what would the seven dwarfs be without "hi ho!"? after the millionth time through it'd almost be better without, but this one spares the parent. not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song. i for one am grateful.the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike. it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children.

atlantis: the lost empire is a better movie than i thought. i never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. true, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking. the story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named milo. milo believes in the fabled atlantis. along with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. along the way, he must endear friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. the voice cast is great. they surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent. the music is nothing special but likable anyway. the animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. i rate this movie 9/10.

"atlantis" is a new and right step for a disney feature. it's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like "atlantis". i didn't have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, i don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews. even in my country the reviewers weren't positive."atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of disney's greatest, even i doubt that this film ever will get "disney classic" reputation. well, that's another case. it's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as "beauty and the beast" and "hunchback" (so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation, he he, i'm just kidding).well, enough nonsense. "atlantis" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film. even this film it's a pg-rated action-feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, he he).the story is a little predictable, but it doesn't ruin the movie. the comic book-inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual disney-style. it's colorful, dark and detailed. the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive. the film is also funny sometimes, even i more giggled than laugh through the movie. (spoilers) the characters of this film are also very likable, but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody, so some characters are left behind (spoilers).the score of james newton howard is absolutely great. it's daring and exotic. (spoiler) the most impressive about this film is how they're making the atlantean language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. it's really awesome (spoilers over)the script is tight and well-written, but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story. but luckily there are not so much of them.so do you're self a favor, don't listen to the reviewers and watch "atlantis", cause it's waiting for you...

definitely a very good idea,screenplay was just ok.could have been better,the positives are that it doesn't bore you if you're an adventure lover,a new idea about the lost world of atlantis.negatives are that i personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this.they should've ended up with a better adventure than this.it wasn't bad at all but it would have been much better with some more runtime.enjoyed it a lot though,cant say that it was boring or wasn't good..a good one for the people who like adventure animations like sindbad,like the road to el dorado.this movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending.

i thought that this film was very enjoyable. i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child. therefore, i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it. it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring. if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so, then they were obviously going to be disappointed. this is simply an animated movie; nothing more. if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed. in closing, this is definitely not the best movie disney has made, but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received.

it is written in stone that disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals. right? where? show me. because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard disney musical fare. while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been, it was still quite good, enjoyable, and adventurous. i had hoped for a bit more, yes, considering the subject matter, but this movie is ~not~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be. the animation quality is average, but the dialog is quite compelling, as is the story line, plot, sub-plot, and amazing creativity i found within this production. i will refrain from outlining the plot, as it has been done and done, but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy.this is, in my opinion, the best disney animated feature length film.it rates a 9.4/10 from...the fiend :.

this movie was great! it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. the animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from disney. it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no singing.the background animation was magical. it was a different level of work for the disney people. some of the characters were a little boxy, but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery. the music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie. this was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into song.perfect. 10 out of 10.

disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. films like "tarzan" and "the emperor's new groove" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. "atlantis" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: this is still disney. the first ever serious film to come out of disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into pg territory. perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.but despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of "the little mermaid" et al.so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. ultimately, this is an action film about atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood! if you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to james cameron's "titanic". both films feature a boat in some manner.and let's talk about love, shall we? yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one milo thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (kida, the clichéd atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. but what i found was not as clichéd as i was expecting. by film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. there's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, "the little mermaid" (a good thing).you may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. correct. you have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. it doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. so what does it rely on? clichés, and lots of them. every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. you have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the russian femme fatale  need i go on?i don't know why this got to anyone  i found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history? at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.but in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. the cgi animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent "titan a.e." down. speaking of characters, disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous disney outing. this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime, "nadia", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. having not seen this anime, i can't comment.with picture, there is sound. gary rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended. to me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it. if you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts (*cough*hercules*cough*).this is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. so sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.

i thought this movie was very well put together. the voice-overs were also great. i liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. i would recommend this movie to anyone. it was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. other scenes made me sad. and others made me glad. it is a movie any age can enjoy. from the moment milo is the crazy "profesor" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. after i watched the movie, i read the book. it was good as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. it is just like the book. but go ahead and watch this movie!

here's what i knew about "atlantis" before watching it:* - it's officially disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. i'm not sure how accurate that is (i like to nitpick) but it made me curious first time i heard it described.* - the preview looked, for the most part, damn cool. evidently, it was also "too cryptic" according to some critics after the fact.* - it apparently did so badly that disney said, "screw it, let's re-release 'spy kids'".so, with all that said, how is the movie?hella-cool.i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway, but "atlantis" goes all out. it's a throwback to all the cgi eye-candy shots in "beauty and the beast" and "aladdin", so much so that it's almost an effects animator's best-of show. the characters maybe aren't that memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot's a little dull, but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot.here's a controversy that bothers me. the "failure" (as in, it "only" took in, like, five-hundred-million or something; i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of "shrek" and "monsters inc." has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. i don't think that's true. how do you account for the "south park" movie? what about "final fantasy"? really, the story and the artistry is everything, not the method. i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like, but i don't think they're out of the picture yet.

this movie is an awesome non-stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a dawid dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes , buffoonish supporting characters , made-up dolls for heroines , nasty villains , wisecracks , rocking soundtrack + choreography and a little dose of action . amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen . the heroine of amitabh the cop is ramya krishnan and raveena is opposite govinda the cop . heroines are mere rouge-smothered props as usual . the conmen have no heroines . paresh rawal carries his villainous act in daud forward (he played a similar don in khoobsurat too) . asrani shines in a brief role . he does a retake on his famous "angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer" act in sholay .govinda is impeccable as usual - as a wisecracking , good-humoured policeman pyaare mohan and as a conman chhote miyaan . he imitates bihari style of hindi speaking with hilarious results . amitabh bachchan , believe it or not , pales in comparison with him . but still ab is fine . madhuri dixit does a cameo as herself in the song "makhna" . she dances like wind . viju shah's music is awesome . check out "kisi disco mein jaayen" , "makhna" and the title track .do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely . just enjoy yourself .

as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie. it was the all round bollywood action/comedy movie. it is a imitation of bad boys obviously! the whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing! the action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes. the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh bachan needed. govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date, he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian cinema.the songs....the songs are both funny and catchy..............proving laughs when you least expect it...amitabh bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as 'bade miah'....his accent...body language..... brilliant...'assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song..............hilarious.

this movie is very funny. amitabh bachan and govinda are absolutely hilarious. acting is good. comedy is great. they are up to their usual thing. it would be good to see a sequel to this :)watch it. good time-pass movie

one of the best "amitabh comeback" movies i liked. this was the phase when govinda was going strong with dhawan. the songs were awesome and totally as we call it "masti" type. an evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in. the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david dhawan's potboilers. with a timely appearance by mrs.madhuri "nene" dixit, it was a total riot towards the end. it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile. although some may consider it a typical "bollywood masala" movie, i would watch it any day. i am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure bollywood.

if you r in mood for fun...and want to just relax and enjoy...bade miyan chote miyan is one of the movies to watch. amitabh started off pretty good...but it is govinda who steals the show from his hands... awesome timing for and good dialog delivery.....its inspired from bad boys... but it has indian masala to it... people think it might be confusing and stupid...but the fact that david dhavan is directing and govinda is acting... should not raise any questions....other recommended movies in the same genre(david dhavan/govinda combo)...are shola aur shabnam, aankhen, raja babu, saajan chale sasural, deewana mastana, collie no. 1, jodi no. 1, hero no.1, haseena manjayegi, ek aur ek gyarah.

it's this sort of movie that you try and imitate. by attempting to realise something... then flying through the air almost immediately. i'd like to do that and i know you would too!great stuff!

if the movies are to be believed, chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their western counterparts. the storylines of the three 'chinese ghost' films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that it's not a huge problem. as always, humour is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of mugging. for those who haven't encountered the 'chinese ghoststory' trilogy yet, this film offers an interesting departure from the western horror/ghost genre; for those who have, another enjoyable romp in the chinese ghost world.

while essentially a remake of the original chinese ghost story, this third installment has higher production values and greater subtlety in both the acting and the story. tony leung is particularly good. cgs iii is a gorgeous, moving film.

the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films. it also seems a lot more erotically charged than i remember the other films being. if you're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach, you'll like this film.

two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows; veer zaara and deewaar. although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone, deewaar focuses on the main subject itself. it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years - for whom neither indian govt. has time or sympathy nor the other side. i'm sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well, but let's focus on the movie. full of actors. some were stage actors like raghubir yadav, rajendra gupta, etc. amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major, acted well. akshaye khanna did his part well. there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs. i think sanjay dutt's role was most solid even though it wasn't too long. he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive. if you compare it to loc, which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions (if it had a story) - deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors. 7.5/10

this is a pretty ok film... yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient, and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast (ab, sd, tanuja). however, the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon (not to be confused with the singer kk). in the scene where he first meets amitabh's character, i thought that a man who can just look at ab, keep staring and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. in fact, he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar, alongside ab for a second time. this guy should get more roles, he's brilliant.if you've read any of the other reviews here on imdb, you already know the plot, and i do agree that akshaye khanna's entry into pakistan was a little too easy. and the little love angle he shared with "what's-her-face" was completely unnecessary. but he is a fairly good actor (as seen in dch), sunjay dutt is cool to watch, always. and ab... what can i say. i don't know if i'm his biggest fan in the world, but i know i can definitely compete for the spot.an interesting watch, considering it's bollywood, although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like "the great escape" and "bridge on the river kwai".

the gang of roses. "every rose has its thorns."a mix of old western and hip hop, blended perfectly together. the clothing styles, the scenery, and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted. plot - in five years, they robbed twenty-seven banks and then vanished without a trace. now, a small western town is under siege, and one of the first victims is rachel's sister. the rose gang is ready to ride again. and this time it's personal.rachel (michael calhoun), chastity (lil' kim), maria (lisaraye), zang li (marie matiko) and kim (stacey dash), five gunslinging women who split up after five years of riding together. when rachel's sister is killed, she ends up rounding up her friends once again and riding on a trail of vengeance. a good, muck around version of western. (if you've seen bad girls, well this is a little bit better in the ways of the female characters).i gave it 10/10 because the characters, plot and scenery made it for me.

i think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films.this is not a bad movie - it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns. i don't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment.what makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong, beautiful women, two of which are black, one asian, and a mexican/hispanic character.these aren't your usual western women--they're tough--they can draw fast and shoot straight.they're so tough even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskey.the plot which moves this story along is typical of westerns--in the vein of "you shot my brother--so i'm gonna get you!" only in this western, a woman's sister has been shot and she's out for vengeance on the gang who did it.so she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing days.one of them, maria, is not really all that interested in avenging rachel's sister, but she is motived by the fact there's gold and jewelry hidden in the town where they're headed.there are a couple of scenes that don't quite make sense, not that they interfere that much, they can be ignored, but i wondered why they were there. so the film could use a little tightening, but over all, this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is.my only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain--of the "heroines", one is obviously straight, the others sexual orientations are never disclosed.7 stars

jake speed is a film that lacks one thing  a charismatic lead. unfortunately that's something that really taints the entire movie and it's a shame because at heart it is an enjoyable action movie with a witty enough script and an interesting, if derivative, premise. although it's genesis probably can be traced back to the success of the indiana jones trilogy  the film actually plays a little more like 'romancing the stone' albeit in reverse. it's not an author of romantic adventure fiction being led on an adventure by a character very much like one of her creations it is an adventure fiction character (who happens to chronicle his own adventures) leading an ordinary woman on one of his adventures.when a young woman goes missing in paris, her sister margaret (played by the appealing karin kopins) gets embroiled with pulp hero jake speed (wayne crawford) and his sidekick dennis (dennis christopher) who both turn out to be real and very flawed individuals in an adventure that takes them into the heart of a civil war torn african state and ultimately into the clutches of two brothers the deliciously evil sid (john hurt) and his ridiculously camp sibling maurice (roy london). that's the plot  it's not labyrinthine and it's not complicated but the story that it tells doesn't require great depth.the action sequences are appealing to begin with and it's certainly true that the heroic trio are put through their paces (whether caught in battles between government and rebel forces or being dropped into a pit full of lions) and there are certainly some quite funny lines. however the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and irksome. this, however, may not have been such an issue if it was possible to like jake speed but due to wayne crawford's performance it becomes harder to really care what happens. now i don't know if he was stretching himself a little thin as he was also the producer and writer of the movie or whether he's simply not a good actor (as i haven't seen him in much else) but he never really convinces as a roguish mixture of doc savage, indiana jones and jack colton.this is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well  karen kopins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with jake (unfortunately it never convinces). dennis christopher is perfect as the archetypal sidekick and john hurt plays the part with camp relish  almost as if he were in a sixties episode of batman. he strides about his few scenes growling in a ridiculous cockney accent putting in a performance that almost belongs in another film. sid is no moriarty (he is presented as jake's nemesis from a number of his previous adventures / books) but he is always fun to watch.jake speed tries to channel the same fun b movie spirit as 'night of the comet' (a film produced by crawford a few years beforehand) and almost succeeds but misses  which is a shame because jake would have been good to watch in a few more adventures and may have been served better by a television series.i would recommend this out of curiosity appeal but ultimately it leaves a bitter taste because most of the elements were there to make something genuinely good.

jake speed (1986) was an amusing parody of indiana jones and other adventurer films that were popular during the eighties. wayne crawford stars as jake speed, an adventurer who's always battling evil doers wherever he goes. with his assistant desmond floyd (dennis christopher) they globe trot looking for some action (and some decent story lines). the duo meet a young woman named margaret (karen kopins) who's sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slaver trader (john hurt). can she find and convince jake and desmond to help her rescue her sibling?a sappy and cheesy film that doesn't pretend to be something that it's not. i have to give this one a recommendation. that's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don't take everything at face value.recommended.

i know the film snobs are snorting. but if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the b-movie jungle, try "jake speed".a little thin at times, but its one-liners and the location more then make up for this. john hurt(god love him), seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver. the nemesis of crawfords, jake speed. he adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like hurt could provide. crawford and dennis christopher( jakes sidekick) are a good team,although you do wonder why they both put up with each other.however ,together both crawford and christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that, if you can get over yourself for a moment, you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide.the delicious karen kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer then her tormentor.i have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy,or bogging down the movie by trying too hard. not every movie has to be the latest "citizen kane". and trust me,wells was an original. so lets remember that sometimes, movies are for fun.not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically. but just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero's live in a celluloid dimension.

ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from? according to 'jake speed' they are based on real people, living out the adventures they write about and publish. this movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and skimpy clothes at the worst. the language is is also not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all levels. this is a 'austin powers' look at 'indian jones', without the over-the-top antics of michael myers. i highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range.

most people (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who don't are being too critical or maybe expected something else. this is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, it grows on you, and has it all. i just got it on dvd and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, having plenty of action, drama, romance, and even comedy. add to that the great car chases, automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun, edge of your seat experience! you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this. you can watch this movie with your wife/gf and you will both enjoy it lots. the premise is that of a paperback book hero, like doc. savage, really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here. the actor jake speed is also a director, producer and writer of many films. in this film jake speed (the character) is an indiana jones adventurer type, he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower (yay!,and sheer dumb luck too!). keep an eye out for his one "james bond" hi-tech equipment, the ultimate road warrior suv dropping out of the sky.the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie "once bitten" and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sister.the bad guys are "real bad" men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate. the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, sadly never made - but you can just imagine what would happen next!you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that's worth the price of a ticket.

i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore. it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day. this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl. wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed. sure, it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone, and indiana jones. but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar. i am surprised not too many people know about it. it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86. i watched it back then on cable tv. it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd. i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks! cool flick.

"jake speed" is a fine movie with a wonderful message. it has its flaws of course. at times it's a little slow. it introduces its villain too far into the story. it's action is paced at the rate of a snail's heartbeat. it has a z-grade cast (although i've always admired the work of karen kopins, who has the straight-laced good looks of sandra bullock).but with all this going against it, "jake speed" really is inspiring, thanks to a charming script by wayne crawford(who plays the title role) and andrew lane.why do i find it so inspiring? because it says to me "hey, why not try to be a good person."the story is essentially a "stranger in a strange land" premise, that is good-and-heroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people. jake is more than a boy scout. he's more than a knight in shining armor. jake speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, mean and evil world.it's because of this that "jake speed" really needed to be a hit. it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the world.imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people. i'm not saying that we should be watching the waltons in every theater at the cineplex, but that it would be nice if more movies such as "jake speed" would get a chance. ("due south," a tv show about a canadian mountie, is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up american entertainment.)sure, "jake speed" has violence, blood and guns, but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you'll beat the forces of evil every time. 10/14/99

this film is harmless escapist fun. something the recent tomb raider film lacked. i can't wait to get the dvd. how can people give this a low score and still go and see titanic without a guilty conscience i do not know. anything with karen kopins in her underwear has got to rate an extra point or two!

the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed. i've seen it at least 10 times. this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. the film begins with margaret (karen kopins) trying to find her sister. her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing. along comes jake speed (wayne crawford), telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her. jake speed is a hero. he doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. his partner (dennis christopher) follows him around and writes their adventures into novels. this film is a great adventure. it's hilarious, it's action-packed, it's just great. i guess it's a cult film with a very small cult following. crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one-liners that you'll never forget. kopins and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick, respectively. john hurt, the guy who's stomach blew up in alien, plays the devilish, pervertish villian which just adds to the fun. in many ways, this film is similar to indiana jones, in some ways it's similar to james bond films. maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever it's title is, it's a very enjoyable film.

one of my favorite films for a number of years was "last action hero"; unfortunately, arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; so now i can't bear any film he may had a hand in.the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last...hero; so i was pleased to find it on dvd, so i could watch these themes played out so well.despite the "plot-within-the-plot" involving white slavery during an african nation's civil war, this is not an action movie. the plot that the "plot-within-a-plot" is within, is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve: is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film, and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this. the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional "adventure-story" universe. that's actually a rich theme, the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film's amiable and campy sense of humor.there are weaknesses to the film - primarily it's cinematography, which makes the film look like a tv show. and the pacing does sag on occasion.but i really like these characters, and i enjoy the adventure they live, however silly. and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel.holds up under multiple viewings -m good show!

i'm going to keep this review short and sweet....i saw the trailer for this and thought i'd give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were "what the hell is this?" but after 10 minutes i was hooked and after 20 i was picking my jaw up from off the floor. this film is a great example of how different a movie can be, and furthermore it's french. this film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package, the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didn't do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and i found myself wishing every film was made like this. i think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters (just watch any hong kong legends film in english to see a perfect example)i gave it 9 although i gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels....

this film is absolutely stunning. a new blade runner - future noir at it's most gritty. the vision of paris is superb, both recognisable and visionary, with sweeping vistas, grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality.the story line is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what i like most about the film. it is a visual treat. done in 3d and rendered in black and white (no greys!) with only one short spot of colour, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. there are many "arty" camera shots - closeups and odd viewpoints - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form.i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped, such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions. but unlike "a scanner darkly" - which suffers from (or indeed is enhanced by) inconsistent character definition (just watch the way some of the hair changes shape!) - renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. when the character is in close-up, added details and texture can bee seen, but when in mid-shot or further away details are omitted, but not to the detriment of character definition.for me, the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one-off project. such a shame, as i would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style.oh, and the english dub is great too.all in all a great film and highly recommended.

much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself (and its film noir influences), so does christian volckman with renaissance.it is the year 2054, in paris. in the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright, sparkling multi-teared jewel. this is a jewel in a setting of misery, inequity and darkness; bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath. one of these "bright" people at the top, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (avalon), is kidnapped. the well known and efficient, captain karas (voiced by the new james bond himself - daniel craig), is assigned the task to find her.the plot and layout is not overly original. it is heavily influenced by film noir, gibson's neuromancer and other detective stories, along with movies like blade runner, sin city, fritz lang's metropolis and minority report. there is the main plot, surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end. it is not hard to figure it all out.the movie's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation. paris is an intricate array of levels and sub-levels. at its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure. as the city rises, so does its architectural complexity and luminescence. yet in this structure, the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior. paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white. the movie is closer in spirit with sin city (the comics) then sin city the movie was with its source material. this is done all the more easy, because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium; animation. much in the same way as a scanner darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling, so does this. the light and dark, black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us. the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time.in keeping with the spirit of the movie, i can be both critic and fan. i can love and loath in the same light. it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts. so pour another black and tan, enter the void and enjoy the ride.

i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed: "a scanner darkly" and "immortel ad vitam". if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy renaissance. it immerses you into the world of a future paris. it is not quite dystopian. they did the animation so well that i thought it was rotoscoped, but from what i can tell, it was not, it was merely motion capture. the facial expressions are amazing! not since tron have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation/live hybrid. the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams, watch for it. the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find. the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises.the plot is secondary, but it isn't terrible. it is noir-ish. there is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth. there is weather. there are "sets" so you can feel like you are in different places in paris. there is some action, and even a car chase. i am going to have to see this one again to get everything. i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.

'renaissance (2006)' was created over a period of six years, co-funded by france, luxembourg and the united kingdom at a cost of around 14 million. the final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic-book style animation, aesthetically similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with 'sin city (2005),' but this film employed motion capture with live-actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format. presented in stark black-and-white, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of paris looms ominously above us. directed by french filmmaker christian volckman, in his feature-length debut, 'renaissance' draws significantly from other films in the science-fiction genre, and the tech-noir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before, but, from a technical standpoint, it is faultless.the year is 2054. the city of paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths, the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings. the city's largest corporation, avalon, achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth, and the company's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process. ilona tasuiev (voiced by romola garai in the english-language version, which i watched) , a brilliant young scientist, is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work, and so it falls to legendary detective barthélémy karas (daniel craig) to uncover her current whereabouts. possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is bislane (catherine mccormack), ilona's hardened elder sister, whose trustworthiness is in question, and jonas muller (ian holm), the dedicated medical doctor who adored ilona as his own daughter.the eerie, dimly-lit city of paris is reminiscent of ridley scott's 'blade runner (1982),' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in 'minority report (2002)' {which was, coincidentally, also set in the year 2054}. however, despite this familiarity, volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit. blending classic film-noir and science-fiction, the result is an eye-catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows, which, i should warn, occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes. the dialogue is a little banal at times, and the story, though engaging, doesn't offer anything strikingly original {except for the ending, which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula}, but 'renaissance' is intended to work best as a visual treat, and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied.

2054. paris is an escher drawing with people and vehicles scurrying along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to fritz lang's metropolis. paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay. and in the blink between surveillance sweeps, a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub. a tough police captain investigates. shown in stark black and white, with the gloomy corridors, shadowy alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard-boiled of film noir, comparisons to sin city are inevitable. but the story owes more to masamune shirow and william gibson than to frank miller, as high tech surveillance, near-invisible stealth suits and ruthless super-corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars. the film never quite generates the doom-laden atmosphere of gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its tech-heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that all seem to have their own ministry of fear, but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent. and as the police procedural plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker recesses of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of avalon corporation's cultivated pr image. the motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between b&w comic books and next generation rotoscoping, and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your tastes. nevertheless, a great visual sense is on display here, and future paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both spartan and baroque. worth a look.

time for hollywood to sit up and take notice! if the actors are acting snooty, all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel. renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings. although the voice overs by the cast (craig, mccormack, pryce etc.) are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the 'cartoons' are unnerving.this style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting. ironically, such technical wizardry makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie. the pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp.plot: disappearance of a mega corporation's top employee unravels a tale of deceit and corruption with a cold hearted hero at the helm. can't say much without giving it all away...except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless.a must watch..even for the 'grown-ups' who smirk at 'cartoons'

i would almost give it 10 out of 10. however, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss-leading which hurt the flow/continuity of the film. the story line is great and well composed; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it. the characters are complicated and so is the story line, expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head, it's a film where all is explained in the end. the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else i've seen in animation. it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it's worth watching it on a good t.v, or plasma. the character voices do save this film in its english version, but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris, i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles. one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it! and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like; waking life & ghost in a shell 2 innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.

there's about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it. beginning with existential themes of blade runner, as well as the vision of the future - with corporate billboards advertising their products, to the technology of the later matrix films and spielberg's a.i., and finally the black and white graphic novel look similar in style of sin city. the creators have put in a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well crafted future neo-noir. add a detective story and you've got an interesting film. i know what it wanted to be, but regardless of the stunning visuals, it wasn't enough to get it to the final destination.

punctuating the opening credits sequence is a swarthy man having a strange, all-too-real nightmare. closing in on its dystopic 2054 paris, the film begins to follow a woman into a grungy club, where she and a slavic bartender convene outside on the deck. they toss exclamations at each other to the effect that she owes him more money although she believes she's paid it all. another woman obstructs the budding violence, only to have a bitter fight with the woman herself. the initial woman storms out, and she is kidnapped. christian volckman's renaissance appears to be another one in an assembly line of recent motion-capture-animated sci-fi noir pictures, but in spite of whether or not that is essentially true, it tells a neatly arranged, classically unraveling detective story that keeps us in the dark in its opening minutes, even whilst introducing karas, the hard-boiled cop we recognize from the beginning as the man awakening from a terrible dream.the rudiments of classic film noir are all hit upon without any anachronistic changes, for all intents and purposes. it is in the harshness of its monochrome that volckman's french thriller has followed no example. for the film's animators, unfettered by the challenges of physical lighting that would normally be faced, have been able to begin with a totally black frame, and to affix utter pitch-white according to the action on screen. as they scrupulously imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame, the distinction of black and white here is full-blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters' less starkly definite moral codes, and the outcome is a harsh and judgmental vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going, sporadically caused to undergo the most blaring and ruthless of illumination. it is the artistic study of film noir taken to their visual boundary of its philosophy, and nothing before has ever shared quite the same execution of this visual concept.all the characters in this decent cyberpunk film seem as if to have been walk off with purely from a gothic comic book in black ink, but all together their physical responses, their motions and the nuances of their facial expressions look ashore within a clear humanity. normally, films that try out new developments in animation allow their technical advances upstage all other facets of production. sin city, for example, left substance and overall good screen adaptation from its source material to be desired.it may not be mind-blowing, it may have its narrative conventions and its voice-over cast may simply be adequate, but renaissance, made for $19 million over six years, not only feels like actual noir instead of a rashly penned appropriation, but also is not secondary to all the visual innovation, which is played as if to be incidental. one leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when karas is evading bullets shot through a crowded glass parisian street, but more about its ponderance of life and death, how life's tragedies, such as death, make life meaningful.

in 2054 paris, avalon, a computer generated system, controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped, detective karas (craig) must go against avalon to find her.renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many.pixar are the animation masters. their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall-e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch. renaissance isn't a film aimed for the young audience though, and like 2007's persepolis, brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation.in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later, christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making.volckman's picture however is a full on animation but it doesn't half look realistic for the majority of it's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time. the faces of the character's are well portrayed and in particular, this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow. the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions. it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed also.for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapirenaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot.the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen. the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we don't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance. renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman, and then we see craig's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements. there are many things wrong with the scripting, not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old, but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages.

every second of the film is gorgeous. and that's why it earns a 7, because the plot is not especially devious, and thinking back over the last 90 minutes i never really felt any excitement or investment in the characters. if anything, the luxurious graphics and framing have made certain scenes (the car chase, for instance) more pedestrian than they ought to be - not that they don't look lovely and have some very original design and occasionally novel camera angles - but they are missing the kinetic movement and close-up shots that are part of the language for any normal action/thriller. the first hour plods along, and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit stagey - people wait for each other to finish and don't always react in a natural cadence, which would be a problem of recording each individual's dialogue separately. on rare occasions the emotions in the voices don't quite match those on screen; something that should really have been avoided. the futuristic architecture is very attractive (lots of glass walls/ceilings/screens, lovely smoke/mirage/special effects) and nice-looking cars, but again - it's more an exercise in graphic design, having no real impact on the story. i'd argue that the whole point of using drawn animation (instead of actors/cgi) is to really push the limits of imagination and design; to do that which is too difficult/impractical in other mediums. although the animation in renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly well-accomplished, i never felt like i was seeing something that hasn't been done before.immortel, another french cgi film, also suffers from an imbalance of beauty over story & pace. to be fair, some marvellous and engaging french movies also have a languid pace, and lingering shots of the look in someone's eyes or the rain on paris cobbles can evoke great emotion - but animators need to understand that while animation brings unique strengths, it also has weaknesses when compared to real-life technique. perhaps it would break from the 'noir' rules that the film wants to stick to, but i think the film-makers also missed a glaring opportunity to explore their future society a bit more - the social strata, the fascistic grip of the corporations etc.i have no problem recommending renaissance to anybody who enjoys stylistic design and/or animation ('manga' fans in particular), but i wouldn't make my other film-loving friends sit through it. take away the sumptuous visuals and it's a barely average film.

just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level, this is a rebirth for motion capture. neither movie nor cartoon, this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir, akira, sin city, blade runner and the new generation of european cartoonists. you see paris the way it almost could be, the characters seem as real as you and i. they blink, trip, shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before.don't go watch it hoping to find a mind twister. you will most likely figure it out before you're half way from the movie. the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers, but this definitely is bliss for the eyes.

a very unique sci-fi animated film, and frankly i love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be, better or worse. this french film is quite interesting to watch, the technique part is innovatory, like "waking life" i recently watched.it took me quite a long time to get used to the black-white style, but eventually i love it, the sketchlike images are really fancy! the contracted future world is a symbol of human race's final destination which i adore it very much.the whole plot is fine for a sci-fi, not so intriguing but it's ok, like some hollywood's products, a giant conspiracy about human's eternity, a little bit cliché and the twisted ending is not so convincing, some development is just too plain and insipid, and the whole movie is too long.so i think i'm just in love with the style this film shows, others are not so good.about the eternity of life, i think most people have come to a unanimousness that we don't want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos. leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but that's also a way to show our lives are genuine and all the emotion fulfills one's life and make the world colorful and lively.

i read that this did not well, that the story is not solid, that volckman feels he has failed in some way.i disagree. first, it is well executed. volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique, but to have a focus that is worth thinking about: would immortality reduce the value of life? big question ...i can see he trying hard to build a feeling, and he is not compromising. this is to be applauded. i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form. i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment. i identify this film with this.further, it is much more interesting than richard linklater's roto-scoping, and volckman's story has more meaning than linklater's later stories of a wasted life on drugs. old news. everyone knows it, but no one does anything about it. renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better.well done, volckman. really nice work.

i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with karas and the tasuiev sisters, renaissance.and firstly, that it looks as it ought to look; a boys' adventure, renaissance is the tale of a cop's investigation in search of a missing young scientistilona tasuiev, the geneticist and researcher for the avalon company.the tale of karas, ilona and bislane is, though much less known than sin city, the better movie, and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs. to the french comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful (i have enriched my french comics collection last week, though i'm not so uptodate). the atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are all nice and endearing. a parisian top cop, karas, is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medicalgenetic research, ilona tasuieva mildly hot blonde, whose rebel sister bislane was erotically preferable, i guess.for me, an oldie aficionado of comics and tv series, renaissance, a marvelously beautiful cartoon, was like a replay of a wild wild west episodehere, a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological futuremore jaded and blasé but, in a sense, as thrilling. renaissance is not suspenseful; nor does it look especially wellpaced; but it's seducing and hypnotic. moreover, it achieves sketching, albeit briefly, a world, a true worldand we will think about the avalon, nakata, jonas mueller, the tasuiev sisters, and goran, farfella, and karas telling of his distant childhood in kasbah . i liked renaissance's feel, of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness, and also the professional, assured look; among these new cartoons, this one and linklater's dick adaptation (--the only and first dick adaptation ever--) stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement.i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and, when not conventional, vividly eerie (like the invisibility costumes).as advisable, the characters have exotic names, like bislane and farfella, mostly gathered from the arts and entertainment's world (goran and ilona and naghib ).none seems to have noticed that renaissance's poster features a rourke look-alikethat guy is marv; which doesn't make it a sin city rip--off, but not a paragon of originality either, and in fact there's more resemblance to the miller talenamely, the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society, the brio of the hero (in fact a cross of willis' character and rourke's persona in the previous movie )on the other hand, this cartoon breathes a more public air, a brim of straight adventurousness, and, in a word, it's like sin city for kidswell, naughtier kids i mean, 'cause there's a bit of nudity on display. to what i have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic, even as clichés and common places of the futuristic more adult comics' look; true enough, and it was oldie miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some resemblances here and there. now it's also fair that every ring ought to have its eragorn, so to each sin city, its renaissance. i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales, a rather undemanding specialty.

this is a film i decided to go and see because i'm a huge fan of adult animation. i quite often find that when a film doesn't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles.this film is certainly more about style than story. while i found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films), it was a bit hard to follow at times, and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have. it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together. whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer. visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and in that sense a work of art.if you like adult animation, or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment. i would recommend it. all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better

animation always seems to be fringe. in japan, this might not be the case, but in europe and much more so in the usa animation has a big fat "kids" tag on it. france is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries, home of classics as tin-tin, asterix, lucky luke, valereon and so on(if you've never read these, it's not too late. there's no upper-age limit on them and they don't carry the nerd-stigma of dc or marvel) it seems natural a movie like this one pops up in france. it suits my prejudiced image of the french as art-loving, anti-usa-oriented and talented movie-makers. luckily there's also "a scanner darkly" out there to suppress that view - seems art is pretty much international.anyway, as you might have gathered renaissance is artsy and french. if you're a normal person you will get scared by this. there's no need for that however! beneath it's cool, sleek cel-shaded appearance there's a good thriller and a good movie overall.that was one of my fears for this movie. it's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick, much like sony & c:o are doing with their pixar rip-offs. i was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring and not very engaging movie, but luckily i was wrong.i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well. note: i've seen the french dub which was ok as far as i could see. english might be more interesting what with craig and everything.a final word of praise to the animation. it was awesome. futuristic, well-crafted, nice camera-work, smart solutions(eyes for example looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning i felt like bursting out "this is so damn impressive!". then again, i really like animation and i appreciate the effort the studio put down, so my verdict is a bit biased.good movie anyway, definitely lives beyond it's "gimmick".

picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper-stylized black and white visuals of frank miller's sin city. then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as steven spielberg's minority report or richard linklater's a scanner darkly. an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut. but although volckman's work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them, such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance, volckman's end result, justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that.genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. as such, renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least, with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama, which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion. the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one (although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation - the film's title also becomes far more poignant) managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through. though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers, the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes, making for a truly compelling work.volckman's film truly excels in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight - superbly moody and stylish, it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have. with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot, and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene, the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic, but with a twist, the end result being consistently visually sumptuous. the film's english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting. the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim, stoic policeman karas, and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating. despite a wavering english accent, romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question, and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation avalon. ian holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes.all together, renaissance boasts a visually stunning, unique and compelling futuristic thriller, just as intelligent as it is entertaining. though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be, the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms. for fans of either of the film's intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller, or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted, slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller, the film is without question worth a watch.-8/10

blade runner (deckard is a replicant!), city of lost children (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far less than what we might dream of), anddark city: these really ought to be added.for a while now, i've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as miyazaki's stuff has. this one is the 1st.hmm, scratch the "animated" part of that.i have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly love, right? but, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a wonder to watch.these people did an incredible job!

if the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent movie. i've just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris (where the action of the movie takes place)and i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my eyes...what a visual shock ! i've never seen such a beautiful black&white photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies. i strongly believe there will a before and after "renaissance", similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences. this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative (a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named "renaissance"...) will receive the success and recognition it deserves. vive la france !

i just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire. it's style is definitively unique and very well made. it is filmed with actual actors, but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before. it goes one step further than sin city, and it does it well. it's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures. the story and mood remind of blade runner, and if you liked that one you will surely like this one, too. the storyline is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. this film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely don't like sci-fi or b&w.

i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto, a short film festival in guanajuato, mexico. one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed: one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white.i shouldn't go on with the details 'cause i think it is a film worth seeing. the sci-fi story might be found average for many... to me was really good. the action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere. things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully. the cast performance is good, in my opinion no one hits the wrong note.now, the thing that i found awesome is the animation. 3d grafics look 2d. a bw comic book brought to life. the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand (i'm sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth). the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! the director, she said, is brilliant, but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv. so, many people had true faith in them. they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them.don't miss it. i think you won't regret it... maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think.

first things first, this movie is achingly beautiful. a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter/compositor, the visuals blew me away. every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story, well, it's okay. it's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic blade runner-esquire tales (and who doesn't?) then you will be fine.i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole. i saw it at the cinema in english, but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere.definitely worth seeing.

i highly recommend this film. set in the bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 paris, it is in most respect a classic film noir script: lady in peril, sister trying to find her, honest cop fighting everyone. luckily, it avoids being stereotypical, and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting, innovative visuals. the film might remind you of sin city in look, but it has an even sharper, even more graphic novel look that i found really compelling. each frame, each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. in terms of story and artwork, you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the eiffel tower and sacre couer) and movies like casablanca, as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations. make any excuse you need to see this film.

if you've ever seen the trailer for the film "the recruit" with colin farrell and al pacino, you'll never have to see that film. sadly, renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers.the story of renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher. the setting is a futuristic paris, and science fiction elements feature throughout. the special thing about renaissance, though, is its visual style, and not its story. renaissance is 3d computer animation, like final fantasy, but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. the result looks stunning (although the problems of 3d animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to tome: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden facial acting, etc) as a highly stylised, beautiful film noir, renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience, especially visually. the story and writing, though, are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals. it's not a bad story (and presumably, if you haven't seen the trailer, it's a lot more exciting than it was for me). but it is a story that isn't highly original, and verges on the corny. a few lines of dialogue were painfully corny, making the writing sound like a beginner's first efforts.i will definitely recommend renaissance to friends. it's unlike anything i've seen before, visually, and i believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. it is also a watchable story, even if it isn't perfect.

one reason pixar has endured so well, and been so successful, is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics, they have a story to match their style. and often very moving style at that: affecting, charming and cross-generational. that a lot anime (speaking in broad terms) and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is, i think (and i might be wrong) partly because either the makers aren't bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image, or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous, so enervating that they don't have the energy to create a really engaging story.that same cannot be said of renaissance. there are flaws in its plot, but i'll get to that later. those same flaws, however, are not reflected in the visuals - renaissance is nowt short of stunning. the ultra-high contrast images (sometimes so high-contrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible) and incredible detail are always impressive, always a joy to behold. the futuristic paris on display is the grim offspring of blade runner and brave new world; dark, murky, quite affluent and even clean, but shrouded in intrigue, corporate malfeasance, obsessed with beauty (capital of the catwalk, after all) and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental, sophisticated architecture.it's a compelling environment, not entirely original, but great all the same. the film's much-touted 'motion-capture' technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a black-and-white photographer would die for. not that the detail prevents entertainment, because christian volckman crafts some superb action sequences: a hell-for-leather care chase, a couple of gruesome(ly imaginative) murders, several tussles in the dark and a nasty dust-up in a gloomy apartment. the locations are great, too (i want to visit the nightclub). while the central character of karas is your regular off-the-shelf maverick cop, the other two female characters (who are sisters) are the real motors of the movie. coming from war-torn eastern europe, products of a war, diaspora and a family spat, they're a compelling metaphor for europe as a whole.the film is tremendously atmospheric, its dizzying, swooping faux-camera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience. however, the plot... it never becomes more interesting than the initial hook, in which indefatigable plod karas must find ilona tasuiev, a drop-dead gorgeous and pioneering scientist, after she's snatched from the street. the sinister corporation avalon (is any corporation ever not sinister?), which she was working for on 'classified', projects are hell-bent on her retrieval, and soon karas is up to his neck in official reprimands, dead bodies, cigarette-smoke and narrowly-missed bullets, and falling in love with ilona's sister bislane (very sympathetically voiced by catherine mccormack), as he plumbs the depths of the city's sordid underbelly (and his own past).text-book noir, in other words, but while i enjoyed the film a lot more than sin city (to which it bears a passing visual resemblance), the plot and resolution are dull, the theme of immortality being raised but never examined, and the shenanigans of high-rolling avalon ceo paul dellenbach are also dull , undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension. the basic ideas are familiar sci-fi genre materials, and there's a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane material.however, the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent, even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry. but it's the projection of life in paris circa 2054, the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold. i may be taking it too seriously, and if that's the case i can at least say that it's superbly made, extremely entertaining (and pretty mature, too), and with an ambiance like no other.

a scanner darkly, minority report, blade runner, sin city and sky captain and the world of tomorrow  if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out.french animation project 'renaissance' took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight i finally got to see it at a private screening for the international film festival in stockholm. my spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection is 'huh, neat' and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding 'meh'. it is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface, but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent, as do the flat characters. nevertheless it is clear that the people at onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface. the visuals are staggering. they have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background. for those of you who are not down with the 'technical lingo', the film looks like a fully-animated sin city. its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning. it's a vision. yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons, suspenseful music, heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking. it's every tech-nerd's wet dream...the film zooms in on an eerily-lit, bleak, futurescape paris in which a major corporation called 'avalon' has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance (think the fluid transparent screens from minority report) and genetic engineering. the latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher ilona (voiced by the lovely romola garai). cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and protagonist karas (daniel craig)  a man who takes the law into his own hands  who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving ilona. during this case, he is being aided by illona's sister with whom he also begins a love affair. a very half-assed love affair, if i may say so.the world of renaissance is remarkable. director christian volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads, rats, femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum. the problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story, or the film would have been "too surreal" for mainstream audiences, owing to its lurid animation format. it follows then that we have a multitude of clichéd characters such as evil-laughing villains, sleazy crime bosses and butch tough-chicks who blow smoke every chance they get. it shoves noir in our faces, and it isn't necessary.what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived. it seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot. this is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction. daniel craig helps here too by bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his hard-edged cop character. at one point in renaissance, he is seen in a vivid car-chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top notch sequences of the film. unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and 'renassaince' could benefit from being slightly shorter. in summary, a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience.7 out of 10

i've seen this film in avant-premiere at imagina festival in monaco.i saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, i was waiting to see the final result. i haven't been disappointed.it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. clearly inspired by some comic books, such as the ones from f. miller. in this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent "sin city" adaptation from r. rodriguez. this time, (almost) no grey or any middle color, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film.(can't wait for scanner darkly)the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise.the futuristic story (paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end. despite a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations)the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms...)gives this movie a great interest.despite it is an animated film, this one is obviously not made for children. you won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. it is far closer to a good film noir.i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film: we still feel the well known paris, but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism.nevertheless, i regret a few mistakes. the montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some poor dialogs. even though the technical is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like "final fantasy" did). those little things makes it a 7/10.altogether, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can. the director, christian volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (luckyly, they didn't ask john woo to do the job!).to conclude, it is a film with blasting visuals, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. watch it if you can!please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.

i just don't understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here. jeez. it is mindless, it isn't polished and it is (as i am reading) wasted on some. the cast of this movie plays their characters to the 't' (if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed). these are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. the problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel. i just don't get it. the jokes work on more then one level; if you didn't get it i know what level you're at.

this is an very good movie. this is one that i would rent over and over again. it is not like your normal superhero movie. this movie blends comedy, action and great special effects. it even has a person in it that does a lot of voices on the simpsons. william h. macy is the bomb.

i can't say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers. yes, it's bogged down by an overly-padded running time, hamfisted editing, and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects. and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch. on the other hand, it's also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and earnest cast, and the classic underdog premise. macy, stiller, and azaria are brilliant as the "core" team, and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team. i can't say reubens or mitchell added much to the film overall, though each had a few chances to shine. the plot, as i said above, is your classic "underdog-makes-good" stuff. no surprises there, since you know they're going to triumph. what makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interplay between the characters. underneath it all, these people are children at heart, who just want to do right. the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding. look at azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; macy's endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept cap. amazing's secret identity; stiller's rage (not unlike that one weird, spazzy kid you once knew who'd always go into quivering, impotent rages on the playground); garofalo's desire to avenge her father. this childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place, is the true appeal of super-hero comics; and underneath its parodic exterior, "mystery men" shows us why these hackneyed comic-book tropes matter to so many.it never really gels into a satisfying whole, due to the huge number of half-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that. the fact that it's supposed to be good, nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here, so i'll issue a caveat: if you're the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical ("am i to believe this is some sort of.. *snort*... _magic_ xylophone?"), then you are far too literal-minded and humorless for this film. go rent a sandler film instead.(7/10)

ok. there are people who should not see this movie.1) don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour. 2) don't like it if you got offended by _the watchmen_. 3) don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie.the rest of you, run, don't walk, to see _mystery men_. it's funny, it's quirky, it's a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man. occasional forays into junior-high humour don't ruin the tongue-in-cheek low-key fun of jeanane garafalo, ben stiller, and hank azaria, as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by geoffrey rush and greg kinnear. (good to see louise lasser getting work, too.) i laughed all the way through. utterly unserious, somewhat weird, but -good-.

i've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. "mystery men" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on tv like "batman" and "captain nice" and cartoons like "underdog" and "super chicken." the same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. it's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here."mystery men" opens on a party at a nursing home. i wish kinka usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. as it is, it looks like something george romero might have devised. we need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it feels patronizing. by the time the red eyes crash the festivities, you half expect tom waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: "just what this party needs--a little excitement!" if writer neil cuthbert had any sense, he would have had waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same. it would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the shoveler (william macy); the blue raja (hank azaria); and mr. furious (ben stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. there are many other problems to "mystery men" than i care to go into; among them that the villain casanova frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and he doesn't. geoffrey rush is the wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. and rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. you hope for the ripe theatrics of a john lithgow in "the adventures of buckaroo banzai" or the dry, debonair diffidence of a paul freeman in "raiders of the lost ark." instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized.there are too many ideas running through "mystery men" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. but whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess i love. ben stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes. this one is no exception, but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by jerry stiller and anne meara. his roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that woody allen made popular. and whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek claire forslani), or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (wes studi as the sphinx), or giving a new member of their "elite" group (jeaneane garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, he makes it always fun to watch. i couldn't exactly say that about him in "there's something about mary."jeaneane garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of "one true thing," not renee zellweger. i don't think i have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. and the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of emily watson's spellbinding talks with god in "breaking the waves." and in this version, the girl doesn't die, and bells don't ring in your head.william h. macy does something very difficult; he makes stolid magnetic. you understand right away what's attracted jenifer lewis' lucille to eddie. you can also understand her exasperation. the barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at his father and says "i believe in you, daddy." to which lucille sighs and exclaims, "roland, don't encourage your father," you feel like standing and hailing neil cuthbert as a first-rate wit. with hank azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in "the birdcage") and louise lasser (has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in "bananas" and "mary hartman, mary hartman?") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; greg kinnear as captain amazing and ricky jay as his publicist; kel mitchell as "invisible boy"; paul reubens as "the spleen;" and lena olin who, if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.

i saw this movie the day it came out last year. hilarious i thought. well, now it's on video and i saw it again. i love this movie! the things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time. the special effects are okay, but the witty dialog will have you rolling. i'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other stuff, avoid. but for all others, enjoy! the acting is superb. hank azaria is hands down the best (he's neither a commie, nor a fruit) followed by ben stiller (uh, don't correct me. it sickens me) and then william h. macy delivering his best performance (outshining fargo) everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo, but i think kel mitchell was pretty good as invisible boy. two problems: the most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between stiller and claire forlani, and the casanova parole hearing. some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way, but they're a blast. kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone, but bam they switch and you're ready for more. i swear after seeing this, you will be tired from the explosive climax (which i think was pretty cool) the camera is pretty cool also, moving at a furious pace with the actors. also, tom waits delivers an outstanding performance (he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him) and like someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them. captain amazing is pretty funny, (especially his speech to casanova about his perfect plan-i was rolling) and rush is pretty cool as casanova. one beef: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. so all in all, a wonderful movie. i give it twenty stars and hope that someday, everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody, the six million dollar man one. laughing right now as i think about it. 20/10

there are many problems with mystery men. first of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities. the special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. paul reubens is wasted in a pathetic, juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent.now onto the decent parts. william h macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect. the sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs. ben stiller is very amusing as well, showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes. all of the characters do, and that is an area which i found particuarly ironic. that is because all of the actors are indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of hollywood.to be honest, the reason i thought it failed at the box-office is that america doesn't get irony.all in all i loved the film, but i feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary cgi landscapes and effects.

mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i've ever seen, but what a film! i thought it was fabulous, excellent and impressive. it was funny, well-done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change! and being able to pull it off! this was great! i'll definitely watch it again!

i've seen mystery men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public ( take the imdb vote for instance), but my overall feeling is that mystery men is more fun than most films, definitely wittier than most so-called comedy films and very nearly 'clever'.the cast is superb; greg kinnear is excellent, as are geoffrey rush and tom waits. kinnear's limo scene with ricky jay is perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work.i will admit the pacing is a little off in places, and visuals are certainly very flash bang, possibly to the detriment of further characterisation, but at the end of the day, this is high concept film making - it's about the little moments "what's up tiger lily?" - and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing.

a lot of the user comments i have seen on the imdb for this movie don't really do it justice. first of all, let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously. it's supposed to be a fun, yet stupid movie, that doesn't require one to think, only to enjoy it. if you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour, then you will be sorely disappointed. yet, if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors/actresses, and some good catch-phrases, then you will enjoy it.

the first thing i thought after watching "mystery men" was how could this movie be so unpopular? i found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic. well, i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit, and you can count me amoung it's fans.simply put, and without giving too much away, this movie does for comic books what "the princess bride" did for fairy tales and "who framed roger rabbit?" did for classic cartoons. that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to (this is one of those cases like "the iron giant" where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands). rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat. you won't listen to the beegees in the same light ever again.

the directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy. many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker (visually -- not story wise) than what i expected. granted, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that (compared to others like something about mary or american pie). as you rewatch it, several jokes stand out and get funnier. if you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book-type movie (batman, x-men, etc.) and liked them, you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie. if you didn't like them, you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those. if you did like this movie, the dvd has some cool extras. (8/10)

******warning: may contain spoilers**************so who are these "mystery men?" simply put, the mystery men are a group of sub-heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. the shoveller (bill macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovel-fighting style. the blue raja (hank azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. mr. furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, so what?). ben stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him.these three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about... becoming real super heroes. obviously, it could happen. champion city has captain amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.to bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, c.a. frees casanova frankenstein, a waaaaay over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by goeffrey rush. this lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp champion city into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing c.a. within hours of his release from prison. this leaves only the mystery men to stop frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with the bowler (janeane garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the invisible boy (kel mitchell), who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him; the spleen (paul reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused sphinx (wes studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.this film really is a cross-genre romp. anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. this is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. but at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. both at once. while not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of d.c. comic's short-lived inferior five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. it offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. sure, the shoveller fights pretty well, and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. but does that make them genuine super-heroes? only in their minds.this movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. one-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ball/father. yet, it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. it mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.what really makes mystery men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. the weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). if the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.of course, no movie is perfect. claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr. furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr. heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. and the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). the cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.yet, overall, this film is incredible. you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.8/10 in my opinion.

a film about wannabee's, never-were's and less-than-heroes making it against all odds. where have we heard that before. but when the unfortunates are the shoveller, the blue raja and mr.furious you know this is not your conventional rags to riches story.a classic performance by eddie izzard as tony p. one of the disco boys leaders and geoffrey rush as arch villain shows actual thought went into the casting. even greg kinnear, at first glance an odd choice for the role of captain amazing turns out spot on.watch this film if you're sick of comic-gone-film stereotypes. why couldn't anger be a super power?

i really didn't expect much from this movie, but it wasn't bad; actually it was quite good. this movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing i have ever seen from a motion picture. now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but i laughed pretty hard at some parts. "the police ruled my father's death a suicide. they said he fell down an elevator shaft. onto some bullets". now this movie is not for everybody, its mostly stupid humor like zoolander or dodgeball; so if you hated these movies i would probably recommend you to steer clear. overall it was an enjoyable movie, about a group of superhero wannabes, who end up becoming real heroes in the end. it's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet, because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage. after viewing this film, i finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes ben stiller, william h. macy, hank azaria, and even that kid from good burger. it's because mystery man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10. a very big surprise.

i make just one apology for this film: there are far, far, too many wide angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, fair enough. they drove me barmy for the first ten minutes or so. but after that i made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, i had ceased to care. this is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily. it's hilarious, it's witty, the comic delivery of all of the cast is flawless, and however much usher peers at his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens - he may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth. `mystery men' is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being. the jokes in the austin powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. the satire of `mystery men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't. it doesn't mock just any old thing. which is why, contrary to what some (i must regard them as unobservant) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas.the `super' heroes are an attractive bunch. sure, they're second-rate, but they're not merely second rate. the blue rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isn't that good at it. on the other hand, neither is he comically bad. he's better in his limited field than most people, and he does practise diligently. he's not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was. if superman is christ in a cape, the mystery men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of mount olympus, in capes. much funnier; also much more endearing.

this was different, that's for sure. just look at the cast! talk about oddballs.william h. macy and ben stiller were the stars, although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight, in this farce about superhero-wannabees. the most outrageous was played by paul reubens of "pee wee herman" fame.there is lots of humor, garish colors and no lulls. it's a pretty entertaining, lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters, all of whom want to be heroes a la superman, batman, spiderman, you name. they have talents in strange areas, however, that the real heroes don't (and don't want to!). it's silly, but you know that going on.it's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity. it's a long movie for one so hectic, so taking a break here and there is okay. the language was tame so kids could enjoy this, too. in fact, i don't recall any swearing in here, except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering, "what a dumb, f---ing movie." i thought it was fun two hours but i'd rather watch it on dvd and take a few breaks.

this movie deserved better it's great fun, has some wonderful jokes and sight gags, some in-stuff for the "geeks" amongst us (and we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effectual. watching paul reubens fart in the face of an academy award winner is worth the price of admission alone. i never read the comics series before i saw the movie, but have since. as good as they are, i still recommend mm the film. (although having the flaming carrot as a character would have been cool, too) greg kinnear is, well,...amazing as captain amazing, and no one else could be the shoveller except william h. macy my favorite line in the film? "we've got a blind date with destiny. and it looks like she's ordered the lobster." see this film. buy this film! it's only 5 bucks and some change at your local wal-mart. you'll thank me. really you will. oh, and ms. garafolo is in it. that alone makes it watch-worthy

i saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it. geoffery rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex luther. kel mitchel and paul rubens were a match maid in heaven. this film also introduced me to william h. macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. hank was great as the blue raja, and i especially loved that the character wasn't really british. the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. i loved the fact that the bowler talked to the ball. some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr. furious's false rage, and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish, and that they never made any sense. i could barely stop myself from applauding when he said "fraculater, freinken-puss," was said. but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie. i highly recommend this film for any occasion, and i give it my own personal two-thumbs-up.

forget depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and have a great time with this maniacally funny, totally absurdist, ultra-campy live-action "cartoon". mystery men is a send-up of every superhero flick you've ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well-cast that they are memorable characters in their own right. dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. the comedic talents of the actors playing the mystery men -- including one mystery woman -- are a perfect foil for wes studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement yoda, and geoffrey rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to walk off the pages of a dark horse comic book and onto the big screen. get ready to laugh, cheer, and say "huh?" more than once.... enjoy!

this is a great movie. i love it more each time i watch. most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or hank azaria says good-bye to louise lasser, or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens -- is a pleasure. this is pitch perfect ensemble acting. the story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end. seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. you can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (wes studi, william h. macy, the tryouts scene. too much good stuff!)

director kinka usher stays true to his own credo, "play it straight and they will laugh," and with the help of a superb cast has crafted what should become the #1 cult film of all time, `mystery men.' when an evil villain, casanova frankenstein (geoffrey rush) is released from a mental institution, captures the local superhero, captain amazing (greg kinnear), and threatens to take over champion city, three wanna-be superheroes, mr. furious (ben stiller), the shoveler (william h. macy) and the blue raja (hank azaria) come to the rescue. frankenstein has been joined by a myriad assortment of underworld scum, however, and has become a formidable opponent. the trio realize that help is needed, and decide to recruit; what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of `superheroes' ever assembled in the history of the cinema. mr. furious has his rage; the shoveler, his shovel; the blue raja flings silverware (mainly forks, and the occasional spoon, but never a knife); the invisible boy (kel mitchell) can turn invisible as long as no one is watching; the sphinx (wes studi), a heavy hitter from down south, is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind. maybe; the bowler (janeane garofalo) can fling a ball with deadly accuracy; and the spleen (paul reubens) wields flatulence that can incapacitate an entire room. this is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or patronizing the audience, while playing it straight at all times. the dialogue is witty, and the performances given by stiller, macy, azaria and garofalo are exemplary. there is a number of memorable, hilarious scenes, especially the one in which they throw a pool party and barbecue to recruit, and conduct interviews with a stupefying assemblage of applicants; and another, in a bar, when the bowler has a conversation with her long-dead father, whose skull has been implanted in her bowling ball. the funniest of all, however, has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue captain amazing. but these are only examples, for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another, laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time. the real secret of it's success, though, is that usher keeps it all real; the relationships between the characters are true, and the whole concept of being a `superhero' is played as being entirely reasonable, which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings. in this world, the aspirations of mr. furious and the rest are tenable, and usher keeps the laughs coming without ever resorting to slapstick or mere sight gags. the solid supporting cast includes lena olin (dr. annabel leek), eddie izzard (tony p.), tom waits (doc heller), claire forlani (monica), louise lasser (the blue raja's mother), jenifer lewis (lucille) and pras (tony c.). `mystery men' is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again, with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing, guaranteed. in the immortal words of the sphinx, `we are number one! all others are number two, or lower.' is it an oscar-worthy movie? hardly; but for a good time and a lot of laughs, treat yourself to this masterwork of comedy; it's the real deal, and you won't regret it. i rate this one 10/10.

this movie was a brilliant concept. it was original, cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren't really 'conformist' movie pickers. don't get me wrong - there are some great movies that have wide appeal, but when you move into watching a movie based on "everyone else is watching it" - you know you're either a tween or don't really have an opinion. this had a lovely subtle humor - despite most people probably looking only at the obvious. the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more "personal" personality in this film. has appeal for kids, as well as adults. esp. nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos! a great film, not to be overlooked based on public consumption. this one is a must buy.

though i can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, i have read my share, so i guess i'm part of the audience of this film, and i wasn't disappointed. it does run out of steam near the end, it's almost overflowing with ideas, and it seems like lena olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting room floor. also, a little of hank azaria's blue raja can go a long way. still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun. all the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially william h. macy as the straight-arrow shoveler, and janeane garofalo as the bowler. and unlike some, i found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. i also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys; somehow, it seemed appropriate.

in the history of movies based on comic books, "mystery men" is one of the most underrated ones. this is no regular comic superhero movie! it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include mr. furious (played by ben stiller), the bowler (janeane garofalo), the shoveller (william h. macy), the blue rajah (hank azariah) and the spleen (paul reubens). "mystery men" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like "superman" or "batman," such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like bruce wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. i found "mystery men" to be visually stimulating and very funny. even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!

as a comic book reader, who still sees myself as a total kid at heart, i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie. i mean, there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time (note: batman forever was not a good superhero movie). i really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read blair witch project) i wasn't disappointed.mystery men was definitely not a high-effects, tension-filled action flick, it was a comedy. and on that basis, it was a success. it had everyone in the small theater laughing, and got applause and laughs right through the final scene. stiller and garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and azaria adds just the right touch of craziness. william h. macy plays a great straight man, while kel mitchell and the fart-powered paul rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy.though the sets are bizarre (and at times seem like ripoffs from both batman and blade runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it is still just plain funny. there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off-guard, and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us.i definitely recommend this movie. although not an all-time classic, it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers retread. the writing is good, and the cast is great. if you're worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised. i mean, who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while?

mystery men is one of those movies that gets funnier over time. there is a naive innocence and "niceness" to the characters. it has become part of our family "culture," and we quote the characters often. it is my favorite film of the last two years. my kids are 13 and 11 and we all three love this film. great acting and comedy. we love galaxy quest and monty python flicks too. okay, we're not talking intellectual here, just family bonding!

this movie is a lot of fun. what makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes, with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. there's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. claire forlani deserves particular note as the object of mr. furious's desires. there's a boatload of talent here. i realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun, and kind of sweet.

i saw "mystery men" on my birthday in 1999 while i was away on vacation. when i came back home, i went to see it again. keep in mind, i was twelve, but at that time it was the coolest movie ever. i even collected the ultra-rare action figures (i have them all except for the bowler, which is the hardest to find. they made mr. furious, the shoveler, the blue raja, the spleen and captain amazing, in case your wondering. there is a william h. macy action figure in existence!). i've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine, due mostly to fond childhood memories. it's not a perfect movie, but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following.the story: a bunch of low-level superheroes save the day. this was executed again in the mediocre, direct-to-video "the specials" as well. but this is the other end of the spectrum: big budget (huge budget, almost $100 million i think) studio comedy. yes, the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot. but don't think this as a stupid, special effects-y superhero movie--it's a parody. they fight a villain named cassanova frankenstein, people. he has a psychofrakulator, whatever that is (it's a doomsday device, he'll take over the world, yada yada.) and resident superhero captain amazing (a zapp brannigan-esque greg kinnear, with commercial-product-logos on his costume, nice touch) is kidnapped. time for the mystery men: mr. furious (ben stiller, gets mad), the shoveller (william h. macy, beats people with shovels), the blue raja (hank azaria, british, throws forks), the bowler (janeane garafolo, bowls), invisible boy (kel mitchell, guess what he does), the spleen (the great paul reubens, farts), and the sphinx (wes studi, cuts guns in half with his mind, i am not kidding). the rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes geoffrey rush as cassanova, lena olin heavily edited out as cassanova's bride, and the one and only tom waits as a crazy weapons dealer. so...with macy, kinnear, olin, and rush there are four oscar-nominees (and one winner) and tom freakin' waits! it's not perfect though. it's overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there (the shoveller's full of them).the dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy, which is sometimes lacking (there's a guy who farts for his power, case closed). the dialogue is definitely a highlight, the cyclical ramblings of the sphinx, the mixed metaphors of mr. furious, etc. it's downright a funny movie, (it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let "all star" by smashmouth out into the world.) unfortunately, the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have. a sequel was originally planned (the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from "the flaming carrot" comics. the flaming carrot was planned for the sequel i believe) but this did not do well at the box office. it could have been a hard sell, a superhero comedy with the guy from "there's something about mary." it also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as "the sixth sense"--which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of august--as well as "the thomas crown affair." two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend, oddly enough--"dick" and "the iron giant." critics gave mm passable reviews, but it was quickly forgotten. sadly enough, on comedy central's roast of jerry stiller, comedian jeffrey ross commented to ben stiller that, "i saw 'mystery men' and i fired my agent." ben is then seen to mouth the words, "i should have to." don't listen to him. give "mystery men" a chance.

as a young teenager at the time, airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their "cowboys and indians" to have amazing gadgets and whizz-bang explosions.in many ways, the show was essentially knight rider in the skies: similar comic-book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of one man making a difference.but in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from knight rider, street hawk, the a-team and other action shows of the time. for one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by stringfellow hawke's possession of airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his mia brother, st john). and then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s cold war context, complete with soviet espionage and central american dictators, not to mention the enemy within. sure, the a-team constantly referred back to vietnam and the team's status as fugitives, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself. with airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (ill-advisedly) diluted as the series went on.with hindsight, the cold war setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are creaky and contrived, and much of what airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. but that's really not the point. airwolf was rip-roaring fun, it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences, and it didn't sugar-coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died. sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a tv budget to boot.for uk readers, dmax (sky channel 155) have just started (jan 2008) daily re-runs of airwolf. set your sky+ box for this blast from the past - we may even get the re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly vastly inferior) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the uk.

one of my favorite shows in the 80's. after the first season, it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast. deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine's character go at it with each other. the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season. unfortunately during those days, blacks did not last long on television shows. some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show. when it went to usa, it was disgusting!!!

i used to watch this show when i was a little girl. although i don't remember much about it, i must say that it was a pretty good show. also, i don't think i've seen every episode. however, if you ask me, it was still a good show. i vaguely remember the theme song. everyone was ideally cast, the costume design was great. the performances were top-grade, too. i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i don't think i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

airwolf the movie, a variation on the original 2 part pilot, yet the movie although shorter, does contain extra footage unseen in the 2 hour pilot the pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie where as a pilot movie is normally the same (2 parter combined) but the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there.worth a look, even if you have the season 1 dvd set, i'd still pick up a copy of the "movie" it's still in some shops like virgin, woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores, although it generally needs ordering, but it saves needing to buy online (as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping) but if you look around airwolfs in storesairwolf was truly 1 of the 80's most under rated shows.a full size airwolf is currently being re-built for a helicopter museum :) info and work in progress pictures are over at http://airwolf.org also with airwolf mods for flashpoint and flight sim games it seams she's finally here to stay :)

so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered. i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly i like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now. i thought it interesting that belisario's airwolf and jag have similar theme - the lead actor (hawke and harm) both are looking for an mia relative (brother, father). wonder if robert belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' theme.question - does anyone have pictures of hawke's cabin. i love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about airwolf.

the story and the characters were some of the best i've ever seen. the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing. i beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel. or at least a remake. if they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating(stupid buster wand) combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy.

legend of dragoon is one of those little-known games that people either love or hate. some people claim it's far too similar to other games, namely the final fantasy series--which is understandable, since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy. honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that, as i'm not very familiar with the ff games.i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form, but every time you attack, you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time. not only that, sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage. even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button-mashing. if you don't want to attack, you can always guard, which not only cuts any damage taken in half, but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions.the fmvs are quite well-done, about the same quality as final fantasy 8's. however, the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard. they're nice, but they could have been--and honestly, should have been--better. the translation as well leaves something to be desired. not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions, but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass.another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters--one dies, and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves. while the death of the one character is often said to have no point, it makes you realize early on that the characters, while heroes, are still just as mortal as the next person. the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats, so the transition game play-wise is fairly smooth. perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest, shana. she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing, pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration. while you can use her in your party, she is insanely weak--i don't even know what her dragoon powers are like, as i disliked her so much i never used her. the character rose, by contrast, is probably my favorite female character in any game ever. she's no wimp, and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful. meru is quite strong as well, while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat.the character designers were, as most are, inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever, and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits. seriously, no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters. but i will give them props, as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries.i can't comment much on the plot, as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next. i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself, or my gaming style.all in all, it's a very enjoyable game. it has its flaws, but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters.

this game is one of the best rpg. fist, it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system (you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can transform into dragoon, the special attack, the magic...). the script is very good. characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support, as happened in several games of final fintasy series. i got bored of that dialogs about past, when you just want to go on with the game's story. ambientation is a jewel on this game, it combines middle-age fantasy with futuristic science fiction. it's remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, i like them more than other in other modern games (we can't remember that legend of the dragoon is 8 years now). then, map is huge, there are all kinds of places an enemies. finally, music is not the best game muse i have heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.

i second the motion to make this into a movie, it would be great!! i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game. i have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. final fantasy eat your heart out!! this should be made into a movie!!!!! if anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie, please contact me. i would love to help with that project any day. the graphics are great for ps1 and even make you forget it is ps1 most of the time. the multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play.

i remember this game. it was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day i decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. i stared in awe at it, since it was the first ever game for the ps1 that i owned that had 4 discs. when i played it, i couldn't put the controller down, seriously.the storyline of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the final fantasy vii storyline, and that is hard to accomplish. when you play the game, you get so involved with the characters it's unbelievable that it's only a ps1 game, as it feels like a movie. and i believe it should be made into a movie.too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it, as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% off sign sitting on it, trying to sell. well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. heck, that is how i got into final fantasy vii, looking in a catalog, and finding it. but this is different than final fantasy.legend of dragoon, is the only game or rpg that is better than most square enix games, surprisingly. i wouldn't be surprised if it was made by square enix but it's not. hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series, or the dragon quest series, but this one is. but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised, which it should be.graphics are pretty good for a ps1 game, but what can you expect from it? it's ps1 man, made in 1999. story i have already mentioned is amazing, almost beats vii. characters are a amazing, you get involved so much with them, and their actions.a definite 10 out of 10. definitely deserved more praise, and a very well done rpg by a company other than square enix.

i absolutely love this game to death. ever since i was 9 years old (i am now 15). it has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and don't forget the ultimately awesome dragoon forms! i am still waiting for a remake, prequel, or a sequel to this spectacular video game. you play as dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero. on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights. you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element. such as fire, darkness, water/ice, thunder/lightning, earth, light, and wind. there are also items known as dragoon spirits, which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend. dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures you'll have to face on this adventure of action-packed thrills and excitement. one of my all time favorite games, the legend of dragoon!

i haven't watched the movie yet, but can't wait to see it! it seems very interesting and inspirational. it was one of the most interesting trailers i've ever seen: the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the "battle within"... thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing. this film looks so fresh and smart. and the actor is really hot. i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies, really clever. i thought that the topic selected-overcoming adversities and childhood traumas-is timeless, and god knows a lot of people need it. bring it on.

on rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the very soul. "lou" is such a film. i got "lou" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business. she watched it for a second time with me. we were both enthralled. her as if for the first time again."lou" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place. it does this while being relentlessly entertaining. bret carr's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen. he crafts a character which disarms with a bugs bunny like, stuttering innocence, but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie. when the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax, i saw my wife in tears for the second time.as a life coach, i facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must see" for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation. it is a brilliant, creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!

this miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting, long term effect on you. i've read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either republicans or child beaters, and their extremist remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets. no such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. the realism of the movie and it's performance by bret carr is not to be missed. the very nature of it's almost interactive effect, will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity. bravo on the next level of cinema.

it came by surprise. . .the impact & resoloution this film had on my automatic way of being reactive to people & situations. most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger. much like the way a spoiled child would be when reacting to not getting their way. . .a temper tantrum if you will. thinking i was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. what was this costing me? soooo much love. . .sooo many blessings. now i'm present to how incredible humbling myself feels, and having an ongoing attitude of gratitude for life. . .for what is happening in the moment, without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way, the way i think life or people "should" be. this film has contributed to the freedom i now feel to connect with others, without limits & expectations. . .and to connect with genuine love. . .without fear of loss. . .just to love first, and accept what love is given.

this is unlike any other movie, the closest thing i can compare it to is a woody allen film... but where as woody allen is constantly fathoming human foibles bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse. in the case of lou, it is the root cause of his stuttering, which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs.there are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption, although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place, so maybe we shouldn't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or breasts.this is an indie film shot on a long shoestring, but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film. i feel like its a quirky gem for the self-help market. i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next, i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks, although usually when a guy like this breaks through, he goes off and makes " x men" and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they.... x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly :)

this is a unique and bold film. it's energetic, with highly developed characters. very good performances. i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think... bret carr dares to look inward, ask questions, and dig underneath the surface. by the nature of the film, it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well. it can take some courage to do this. i can see how some close-minded people might find this quite disturbing. however, i found it thought-provoking, much more than just entertainment.bret carr is truly an original filmmaker, with vision. i am curious to see what he will do next.watch him.

i watch movies for a living, picking out which ones are good enough to distribute... tossing aside those that don't make the cut. i'm not saying that i know more than anyone else based on this, i'm just leading you to how i came to watch "the gospel of lou"... anyways... so many bad movies land on my desk and i actually sit through all of them. i don't actually "watch" everything, usually i just look over at the tv occasionally while i'm working the scan for production value, performance, and how well the story is being presented. if something catches my eye i'll take the time to watch it. "lou" drew me in during the first few minutes where i closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the tv so i could completely tune in. needless to say i was enthralled throughout the whole movie. the story is told well, the characters are either endearing or repulsive (depending of course on the actor and directors intention for the character) and all very well played. at times i caught occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story make these faults easy to dismiss. i've heard other people's comments say that at times the film brought tears to their eyes, other time extreme elation... i was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie. sadly i was unable to acquire it because i was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short. that's the way it goes sometimes... but at least i had the pleasure of seeing this one and i can't wait to see what kind of response it gets. good luck and great fortune to you bret carr (if you read this), you are without a doubt a talent to watch for.

anyone who doesn't like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons. this film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times, but that is its intention. it asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like lou eventually does. it asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be. bret carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has. the intention and the message is clear and profound. people's apprehension about this film stems only from their own insecurities. an open-minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it. sometimes a life- changing realization does come in a flash -- a light bulb going on. this story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way.

this was one of the highlights of st:tng's semi-forgettable second season, before they 'grew up' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond. this was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher, but was also the continuation of data's search for his 'humanity', this time through the concept of comedy. still one of my favorite episodes.on a side-note, i'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a tryst(after teri hatcher's character) before being rudely interrupted by lt worf. i remember watching this episode 'first-run' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would've been a perfect jean grey/marvel girl.it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is...

winchester '73 was the film that moved mann from the b-movies to the big league, rescuing james stewart's floundering post-war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero (although since he inherited the project from fritz lang, maybe lang deserves the credit for that). both men would go to much darker places - mann with the remarkably bleak devil's doorway, which remained shelved by mgm until the success of broken arrow convinced them to release it  but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the director's beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than you'd expect from the studio system. great dialogue, an impressive supporting cast  dan duryea, will geer, millard mitchell, stephen mcnally, shelley winters, charles drake, tim mcintire, jay c. flippen, tony curtis, rock hudson among them  and mann's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one.

this is a story of the winchester rifle model 1873 "the gun that won the west" to cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the winchester 73 was a treasured possession. an indian would sell his soul to own one...winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director anthony mann and actor james stewart, a duo that would go on to create a run of superior westerns that added a new, psychological depth to the genre. the story sees stewart as lin mcadam pursuing the man who killed his father. riding into dodge city with his trusty friend, johnny williams {millard mitchell}, lin runs into dutch henry brown {stephen mcnally}, the man he wants. but with wyatt earp {will geer} having taken all the guns from those entering the town, both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for. the men instead square up in a competition to win a winchester 73 rifle, a competition that lin eventually wins. but before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast. as lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.very much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called "psychological western", winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past. tho shot in black and white {the only one of the duos westerns that was} the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes. the tone is set with the opening scene as lin and johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to dodge city. it's just the starting point that would see mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as mcadam, proving once and for all that he was one of americas finest and most versatile actors. the support cast isn't too bad either. shelley winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo, while mitchell, mcnally, geer and the always great dan duryea add further class to proceedings. there's even bit parts for tony curtis and rock hudson in here, tho the latter playing an indian brave is a stretch too far.originally the film was a project for fritz lang, who even had the script ready to run. but lang walked away from it, something that proved to be a blessing for western fans. for as great as a director that lang was, with mann directing {and with a new script from borden chase & robert richards in hands} it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre. not only with the further efforts that mann & stewart produced, but also in who they influenced. the likes of budd boetticher, nicholas ray and sam fuller were all taking notes, and gleefully for the western purists, they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further.a big hit at the box office back on release, winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age. 9.5/10

a very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over. the cast is very good, there's plenty of action, and stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist) in the end. i've seen this film several times, and always watch when it's on amc or cable. highly recommended...

"winchester '73" marked the first of a series of westerns involving james stewart and director anthony mann. as in most of them stewart's hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time. the title refers to a "one in a thousand" rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in dodge city on july 4, 1876. into town comes lin mcadam (stewart) and his sidekick high spade (millard mitchell) who are on the trail of dutch henry brown (stephen mcnally) for a past dastardly deed. they arrive just in time to see marshal wyatt earp (will geer) running saloon girl lola (shelley winters) out of town. it turns out that dutch henry is also in town for the rifle shoot. lin and dutch henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with lin winning but dutch henry robs lin of the gun and escapes. lin and high spade trail dutch henry across country where they encounter lola with her cowardly beau steve miller (charles drake) hold up in a u.s. cavalry camp awaiting attack by the indians led by young bull (rock hudson) who has acquired the prized rifle by murdering wily gun runner john mcintyre. he had got the weapon by cheating dutch henry at poker. young bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to steve. meanwhile, back at the ranch, lola and steve meet up with notorious gunman waco johnny dean (dan duryea) who kills steve and takes the valued rifle and lola for himself. when dean meets up with dutch henry, he allows him to take back "his gun" planning to murder him later. in the town of tuscosa, lin kills dean as dutch henry's plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with lin in pursuit. in one of the best final shoot outs ever, the two meet in the final showdown. i believe that this movie was the only one of the stewart/mann collaborations that was shot in b&w. it is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the "wide open spaces" and in particular, the final showdown. stewart playing against type, plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge, an emotion that he would carry into future films with mann. as in most universal westerns, this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day. in addition to those mentioned above, j.c. flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, steve brodie, james millican, john doucette and chuck roberson as various henchmen, ray teal as the sheriff pursuing duryea, tony curtis and james best as rookie soldiers and edmund cobb, chief yowlachie and john war eagle in various roles in the dodge city sequence. a classic western in every sense of the word. it was responsible for re-generating stewart's career as an action star.

a fine western, following the fate of those who possess the prize winning gun, a winchester '73. it has a great cast who give superb cliche characterisations with help from the usual effective story telling direction from mann.

keep in mind i'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time. how i've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me. to me this is a better film then the much lauded "high noon". it's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography. if you like westerns or james stewart this film is not to be missed.

the picture is developed in 1873 and talks as lin mcadam(james stewart) and high spade(millard michell)arrive to dodge city looking for an enemy called dutch henry(stephen mcnally).the sheriff wyatt hearp(will ger)obligates to leave their guns.both participate in an shot contest and stewart earns a winchester 73,the rifle greatest of the west but is robbed and starting the possession hand to hand(john mcintire,charles drake ,dan duryea).meanwhile the starring is going on the vengeance.first western interpreted by james stewart directed by anthony mann that achieved revive the genre during 50 decade. the film has an extraordinary casting including brief apparition of rock hudson and tony curtis,both newcomers. the picture is well narrated and directed by the magnificent director anthony mann who has made abundant classics western:bend the river,far country,man of laramie,naked spur,tin star. of course, all the essential elements western are in this film,thus,red indians attack,raid by outlaws,final showdown.the breathtaking cinematography by greta garbo's favourite photographer willian daniels. james stewart inaugurated a new type of wage,the percentage on the box office that will imitate posteriorly others great hollywood stars. although the argument is an adaptation of ¨big gun¨ novel of stuart l.lake and screenwriter is borden chase,is also based about real events because 4 july 1876 in dodge city had a shot competition and the winner was rewarded with a winchester 73 model 1873 with ability shoot 17 cartridges caliber 44/40 in few seconds.

contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne, no other actor sat taller in the saddle in westerns than james stewart, and this movie proves it. this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester rifle,has only one weak spot i can think of: the casting of will geer as a very unearp-like wyatt earp. the casting of the villains was good:stephen mcnally, as surly dutch henry,dan duryea as waco johnny dean, and john mcintire(versatile at playing both good guys and bad guys) as a slick gun runner. the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliffs is great! i'd stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today. they wouldn't stand a chance!

this complicated western was a milestone in the career of james stewart after his return from war service, wanting to change his image by doing a western, which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the '50s since it's very impressive. too bad it wasn't photographed in technicolor.stewart wins first prize for "the gun that won the west", but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen. shelley winters is a shady gal with an unsavory reputation and stephen mcnally is the local bad boy gunman in dodge city. will geer is wyatt earp and dan duryea is shelley's bad boyfriend. and wouldn't you know that, it being a universal-international film, tony curtis and rock hudson (both quite unknown at the time) have bit roles.an interesting sequence features the first indian attack, whereby charles drake reveals himself to be a coward who rides off, leaving shelley alone in the horse-drawn wagon. he later redeems himself, but it's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to another--but finally ending up with the rightful owner.stephen mcnally and james stewart have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as duel in the sun's blazing guns finale. mcnally makes the perfect villain and dan duryea is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the '40s as a low-life gunslinger.tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by anthony mann, and it's fun to see rock hudson (credited as young bull) wearing indian war paint and tony curtis as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive shelley winters.well worth viewing and definitely an above average story.

lin mcadam (james stewart) wins a rifle, a winchester in a shooting contest.dutch henry brown (stephen mcnally) is a bad loser and steals the gun.lin takes his horse and goes after dutch and his men and the rifle with his buddy high spade (millard mitchell).the rifle gets in different hands on the way.will it get back to the right owner? anthony mann and james stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, winchester '73 (1950).stewart is the right man to play the lead.he was always the right man to do anything.the terrific shelley winters plays the part of lola manners and she's great as always.dan duryea is terrific at the part of waco johnnie dean.charles drake is brilliant as lola's cowardly boyfriend steve miller.also wyatt earp and bat masterson are seen in the movie, and they're played by will geer and steve darrell.the young rock hudson plays young bull and the young anthony (tony) curtis plays doan.there are many classic moments in this movie.in one point the group is surrounded by indians, since this is a western.it's great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.all the true western fans will love this movie.

the narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother. the main character, lin macadam, played by james stewart, represents justice and righteousness. his brother, who operates under the persona of dutch henry brown, played by stephen mcnally, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father. the world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman wyat earp. present as well are such flat characters typical of the western, such as the murderous indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet-clad damsel in distress. another important archetype in this film, that which gives the film it's name, is a custom made winchester rifle. the weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it. in this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in raiders of the lost ark, and the blood stained letter in saving private ryan. this gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as jack arnold's no name on the bullet, and clint eastwood's unforgiven. there is also a tacit theme of rape in winchester '73. waco johnny dean, one of the film's villains played very effectively by dan duryea, abducts a woman after killing her husband. the volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off. waco johnny dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous winchester rifle. the main story of winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as told in apollonius' argonautica. both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality. like jason, stewart's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one-of-a- kind prize. another theme in winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers. several stories of antiquity deal with this issue, such as the hebrew bible's tale of cain and abel, and the vulgate tale of romulus and remus. as for the theme of abduction and rape present in anthony mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of europa as told by ovid in his metamorphoses. winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic american western and ancient mythological themes.

one of the greatest westerns of all time! but this one, unlike many others, does not deal with the nature, horses, shootouts, etc., but instead deals with one rifle, the winchester '73, and how this one rifle effects others and how they effect it. a rifle is not a living, breathing, human being, right? you may be inclined to believe that it is not. but it seems to have a mind of its own, for two very similar reasons: it gets back to its rightful owner in the end, even though that throughout the rest of the picture, its unthoughtful "owners" do their best to make sure it does not, and it never seems to be content until it gets back to its original owner, so, coincidentally, the unthoughtful "owners" always seem to lose it somehow or get killed trying to protect and keep it, until it gets back to james stewart, then it is "content". but, not every one of the owners deserves to have it. stewart does, of course, since he won it. mcnally does not, since he had to be a dirty thief and steal it. drake definitely does not, because he would probably lose it in some poker game, and besides, drake is too cowardly to fight, so why should he have a one-of-a-kind rifle if he will not even use it? duryea does not, because he is just a chuckling maniac, and we all know that chuckling maniacs do not deserve guns. this film has a sort of noir edge that only westerns can have, such as the ox-bow incident. westerns have their own type of noir, much different than the 30's and 40's bogart films. it is, hands-down, the best one out of all five stewart-mann westerns, even though my personal favorite is "bend of the river". the other four became much different than this one. i do not think it a coincidence to see that the other four were color, and this is black and white. this is because of the noir edge. all five films had the revenge and the dark past on stewart's part play into the film, to the point where this is not just stewart's dark side, but also actually a sort of character, not one to be listed in the credits, but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there, always present. however, this one, not just on revenge and the dark past, but also in terms of supreme danger, and characters that were very different than stewart make it surpass the other four in all aspects. but stewart never crosses the line. he does, however, walk the line between light and dark. this is why black and white played such an integral part in the film. they could have all been black and white, or they could have all been color. but this one is in black and white, and the other four are in color, and there is a very good reason for that.

the larger-than-life figures of wyatt earp and bat masterson, and the specters of george armstrong custer and sitting bull, loom over director anthony mann's hugely entertaining first western with james stewart. although stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (john mcintire, especially great) and outlaw dan duryea, who's even more despicable than usual. the film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with mann's pared-down, compositionally rigorous film-making. his themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun, but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement, and are defined in stewart's conversations with sidekick millard mitchell. mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns. instead of gazing at vistas from afar, he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect, complicate, or evoke the human characters' goals. just as mountains, caves, and rapids had to be accounted for in the naked spur, here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain, a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters. (i would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer william h. daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day-for-night, open-range photography.) not merely an adept outdoorsman, mann presents an equally vivid picture of wyatt earp-patrolled dodge city, primarily through scaled, multiple-plane staging. the shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot. nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on the actors' eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes. one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: mitchell's telling of stewart's motivation to shelley winters, which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all. light without feeling insubstantial, intense without being overbearing, winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold.

saw this flick on encw last nite for the third or fourth time. enjoyed it so much i ordered the dvd. this really is a standout and of course the first of the mann-stewart pairings. more here than the usual oater, although not quite as powerful as the searchers. lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by stewart, his partner millard mitchell, shelly winters and the waco johnny dean- dan duryea. steve miller (not the joker) is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in lola but too yellow . like stewart in the man who killed liberty valance, he's practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his enemies coffee. decaf no doubt. tony curtis from the bronx cavalry and rock hudson behaving like no indian i've seen on screen have interesting cameos.special performances by john mcintire as a too lucky card dealing/gun trader who hangs out at a very low grade western version of rick's american cafe. nobody wants to spend the night there. jay c. flippens out over a kiss from lola (winters) and has some nice scenes with stewart before he gets to bend of the river and far country. will geer as wyatt earp and the indian chief who takes walter brennan's teeth from him in red river are pleasant sightings. this is the kind of western that only stewart, not wayne nor scott could have pulled off. worth the shot, i repeat. :-)

this is quite an unusual and unique little western, that is made mostly original due to its story that revolves around an unique and superior winchester 1873 rifle and all of those who get to poses it at one point or another in the movie.it's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch but not without still being a real western as well. the movie got done in a typical '40's/'50's style of western genre film-making, so the lovers of the genre should not be turned off by its somewhat unusual main premise.because the rifle is actually being the main plot device of the movie, it allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the movie, who are all connected of course and the story makes full circle in the end. without that this movie would had been a pretty messy one to watch, since the story often jumps from the one hazardous occasion into the other, with constantly different characters involved. quite amazing how they even managed to put wyatt earp in this all. but it's no criticism really. i liked that the movie and its story were being original and how the movie seemed to move from the one event to the other. it gave the movie a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment.it's also a really great looking movie. i liked the settings the movie used and it seems quite amazing that this was actually the director anthony mann's first western. luckily he would go on to direct more westerns later on, which also often would star james stewart in the main lead.it was a pretty daring casting choice to pick james stewart as the main lead. he is one of the softest and most polite looking and acting actors, so casting him as a tough gunslinger seems like a bit of an odd pick. but stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and really capable as an actor he actually was. it also has some other surprising actors in the movie, that are not often get connected with this genre. shelley winters plays the female lead and also later well known actors rock hudson and tony curtis appear in some small roles.a real western with also plenty of action and entertainment to it.8/10

by 1955, five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together, four of them westerns. their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic. buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that's not counting ray teal or 'anthony' curtis, later to become tony. perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned. one to add to the dvd collection.

winchester 73 is the story of a man (jimmy stewart) obsessed with getting back his prized possession, a repeating rifle made by winchester. the rifle keeps changing hands, and stewart doggedly keeps after it. this 1950 b&w effort by anthony mann is more a crime film than a traditional western, and the cowboys often seem more like modern-day gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. shelley winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man (charles drake) she may marry. she ends up falling for stewart, but not before she is passed around a bit. winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters. watch for a young dan dureyea as a nutty killer and tony curtis in a very small role. a woefully miscast will geer plays wyatt earp.

a new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor james stewart teamed with the equally-brilliant director anthony mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future. until that time stewart was mainly noted for an aw..aw..aw approach to family oriented comedies, dramas, and romances. not that he wasn't already a multi-talented hollywood star. one of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as macaulay 'mike' connor, a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in "the philadelphia story." he had even done westerns before. his portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot thomas jefferson destry jr. in the comedy western "destry rides again" helped make that film a classic. but to most movie goers he was the all-american boyscout type mr. smith or george bailey. seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played. anthony mann was associated with b flicks in the film noir mode. "raw deal," "side street," and "t-men" caught the eye of james stewart. so the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest hollywood westerns ever made. "winchester '73" and "the man from laramie" were the best but the others were almost as effective. mann became a successful director of a films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all gary cooper's "man of the west." stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid, a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on.winchester '73 was also one of the first films, maybe the first, to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun. each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie, which also holds a surprise for the viewer. based on a story by stuart lake, the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the winchester '73. the year is 1876. custer and his 7th cavalry have been annihilated by the sioux and cheyenne at little big horn. the whites want revenge. the native americans want their land and their way of life back. this conflict leads to a confrontation between native americas led by young bull (young rock hudson showing his potential as an actor) and a small cavalry group pinned down in a canyon and joined by civilians lin mcadam (stewart), his partner and life-long pal high spade ( the underrated actor millard mitchell), and a couple trying to find themselves, steve miller (charles drake) and lola manners (shelley winters), a soiled dove with a kind heart. among the horse soldiers are newcomers tony curtis and james best (late of the "dukes of hazzard"), whose part is cut short by a bullet.wyatt earp was in dodge city in 1876. the movie has him as head marshal. the fine actor will geer (later of the waltons) looks like an older earp. in reality wyatt was assistant marshal in dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a lawman. lin mcadam wins the winchester in a shooting contest, but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw dutch henry brown (stephen mcnally) and his henchmen. mcadam and high spade are after both dutch henry and the winchester for the remainder of the movie. an even more sinister character emerges along the way, waco johnnie dean, played as evil personified by dan duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast.the winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film, each time the transfer is intense. one involves a gunrunner played to perfection by john mcintire. other swaps are intermingled with the scenario above. all this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show.as noted above, the cast is first rate down to the smallest role. look for other familiar faces in uncredited parts, including the future sheriff of "bonanza" ray teal and b western reliable panhandle perkins (guy wilkerson).

winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what i like about it. it's not your everyday western--it uses a rifle, which passes hands from various characters--as a mechanism for telling the story about these people. rock hudson plays an indian chief, jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength, and shelly winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west. it's important to note for those politically correct types--they kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse. by today's standards, it's still pretty violent. but it's a great story and worth watching. enjoy!

james stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate of the films other star the winchester rifle. stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy. the story follows the fate of a winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting.we meet a selection of gamblers, gun fighters, indian traders and bank robers as we follow the rifles path through indian battles, bank heists etc. the supporting cast are all solid with dan durya standing out as waco johnny dean the live-wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger. also as a trivia note a very early appearance from rock hudson as an indian chief.the end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop. throw in some good old western action, fist fights, shootouts and horseback chases it makes for a rollicking western adventure. 8/10

winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after wwii. director anthony mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. jimmy stewart does an excellent job, but i think stephen mcnalley and john mcintire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured winchester 73 going to the winner. this is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. look for the first appearance of rock hudson as young bull. thank god, with in a few years, we would begin to let indians play themselves in western films. the film is in black and white and was shot in tucson arizona. i would not put winchester 73 in the category of stagecoach, high noon or shane, but it gets an above average recommendation from me..

this stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all. james stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized winchester in a shootout, only to lose it in a robbery. the story details stewart's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film. the rifle changes hands time after time, as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence. the picture has plenty of action and suspense as stewart closes in on his quarry. a great cast supports stewart here, namely stephen mcnally, dan duryea, millard mitchell, john mcintire and jay c. flippen. shelley winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure. tony curtis and rock hudson, teen heartthrobs in later years, have brief but good roles.

for the viewer who comes upon it long after its making, "winchester '73" has something in common with "casablanca." while you watch it, you get this feeling that you're looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre; then you realise that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film, and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great. in other words, it's a seminal work."winchester '73" is a joy to watch. the broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies, and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you. the dialogue, the pacing and mann's direction are excellent. stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan this is a "must-see," but he is not alone in delivering a good performance. remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and/or witty lines go to minor characters. because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cutouts, it lent additional realism to the film. this is a remarkably underrated film, and well worth keeping an eye out for. the dvd also contains an interview with stewart which provides some background on the film.

i was very impressed with this film. i would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns. i say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography.director anthony mann, who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one. it has that same film-noir look. mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . if you like this movie, i recommend the mann-stewart film "bend of the river."in a nutshell, the story is about a man, "lin mcadam," (stewart) who owns this prestigious winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest. it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain. all of those villains are interesting characters.aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters, dan duryea, stephen mcnally, millard mitchell, charles drake, will greer and j. c. flippen. all of them are fun to watch. it was a bit of a stretch, however, to see rock hudson playing an indian ("young bull"), but you can't have everything.

in 1942 a film tales of manhattan told a set of stories that were basically unrelated, but tied together with a suit of men's evening wear. each story began when the "tails" were passed from one owner (charles boyer, for instance) to another (ceasar romero). winchester '73, a superior film, and a great western, has a similar plot twist. initially it is about how jimmy stewart is seeking stephen (horace) macmahon for some deadly grudge. but in the course of the film the two men get into a shooting contest, the prize (given by marshall wyatt earp - will geer) being one of the new winchester rifles. stewart barely beats out macmahon, but the gun is stolen from stewart, and the chase is on. the gun passes from hand to hand, including john mcintyre (as an arrogant trader who fatally does not know when to stop being arrogant), to rock hudson (in a surprising role - and a brief one at that), to charles drake, to dan duryea (as the delightfully deadly and psychotic waco johnny dean), to macmahon. eventually it does return to stewart.the film is expertly directed by anthony mann. every character has a wide variety of experiences. duryea gets the rifle literally over drake's dead body (duryea forces the issue). but he loses it to macmahon, who is faster on the draw - not that duryea is stupid enough to fight for the rifle. as he and shelley winter look at macmahon in the distance, winter (who watched duryea kill her former boy friend drake) drops her distaste for the gunman momentarily to ask why he put up with macmahon's bullying for the gun. philosophically, duryea explains he can wait. some opportunity will come up later on (i.e., when he can safely kill macmahon and get back the rifle). the characters are remarkably human. winters first appears as the future bride of drake, but she sees a really big negative side to him - an unforgivable side. drake is aware of this lapse, and it helps lead to his destruction. other characters have realistic touches, such as j.c. flippen as an army sergeant who fights an indian attack with steward and steward's friend millard mitchell. oh yes, and with flippen's fellow soldier - tony curtis. flippen makes one believe this soldier has been on a hundred battlefields before, since 1861 probably. steward had showed emotions in other films. in it's a wonderful life he showed a degree of anger at times, and also a near nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong with his life. but here he showed a demonic anger - at the expense of a surprised duryea (who normally would show such anger himself).the parts of this film fit very neatly together, under mann's competent hands. this is one western that never wears out, as the audience watches the travels of a winchester rifle.

buffs of the adult western that flourished in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome. of course, we can go back to howard hawks's red river (1948) or further still to john ford's my darling clementine (1946), but if we want to stick with this single decade, then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that era's initial year. one is "the gunfighter," an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger (ringo) facing his last shootout. another from that same year is "winchester '73," and it's worth noting that millard mitchell appears in both as grim, mustached, highly realistic range riders. in the gunfighter, he's the town marshal expected to arrest ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang. in winchester, he's the sidekick to jimmy stewart, a kind of horatio to stewart's hamlet in this epic/tragic tale. the plot is simple enough: stewart's lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable winchester in a shooting match, beating the meanest man in the west (stephen mcnally), who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father. when the brother steals the gun, stewart and mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier, meeting up with both outlaws and indians. (in one wonderful bit, two future stars - rock hudson and tony curtis - play an indian chief and a u.s. cavalry soldier - during a well staged pitched-battle. dan duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader, while shelly winters, just before she began to gain weight, is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together. today, filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen, but anthony mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time, with not a minute wasted. such western legends as bat masterson and wyatt earp (terrifically played by will geer) make brief appearances, adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature. the final battle between good and bad brothers, high atop a series of jutting rock canyons, is now legendary among western buffs. it's also worth noting that stewart, however much associated he became with western films, does what is actually his first western leading man role here - yes, he was in destry rides again eleven years earlier, but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so wrong for westerns!

in the fifties the age restrictions for films in brazil were the following: no restriction, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old, when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14, but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18. winchester 73 was one of those, and i think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average. the hero, james stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father. he was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good guy. anthony mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with stewart. shelley winters, the leading lady was far from virtuous, she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle. dan duryea as waco johnnie dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered. the story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited for a western. it was to be made into a fritz lang film, which did not come through. when it was offered to mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for lang. with winchester, mann created a different conception of western, but still maintaining all its traditions. winchester still is a great film to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released.

the traditional western is synonymous with wide open spaces, clearcut morality, inevitable storylines, the optimistic faith in a hero's ability to shape his own destiny, to escape his past. these qualities reflect directly the american sense of self, the self-shaping dream, the pushing of boundaries and frontiers, which is why the genre is still alluded to by opportunistic politicians. with some noble exceptions (eg wellman, hawks), the western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety. anthony mann changed all that forever, and this first foray into the genre is one of the most violent, vivid, complex, not to say exciting westerns ever made.the traditional western depends on a hero who exemplifies rugged wholesomeness, whatever misfortunes he may have had in the past, a supporter of order and right, who dominates the film, removes its obstacles, restores harmony in effect; and an obvious villain, who often, ironically, drives the plot, forces the hero into certain actions. the difference between the two is often delineated as mythically simple as the wearing of white or black hats.mann's background was in film noir, a genre antithetical to wide open spaces and optimism. noir was neurotically charged, focusing on the dissolution of an unstable protagonist, where morality is blurred, the hero is as often the villain, trapped in an interior-labyrinth of his own making, a passive victim to destiny. noir is about regress not progress, the interrogating and denying of modes and signs of representation, not the creation and confirmation of them.winchester 73 is fraught with noir anxiety. noir is often considered a psychological genre, visualising the traumas of its protagonist's head. 73 does this too, and is all the more disturbing in that that protagonist is lovely, homespun jimmy stewart, initiating here his great run of difficult films with mann and hitchcock. in many ways, good-natured and sweet, representing right and trying to restore disruptions to the natural order, he is also a near-lunatic who will stop at nothing to achieve murderous revenge, whose relentless quest mirrors ethan edwards in the searchers in its inhuman persistance, whose human instincts are frayed by this quest, and whose bursts of violence are genuinely terrifying to witness.as in noir, his anxiety has a psychological base - unlike most 'healthy' heroes who have outgrown (symbolically killed) their fathers, mcadam's father was killed before he could complete the process; his chasing his brother is less moral revenge than an anguished protest against stunted growth. the climactic shoot-out is not cathartic: mcadam staggers back into 'normal' society, like he's just witnessed some of the world's most ghastly horrors.what is most unsettling about the film is that it's not really about a hero or a villain at all, but an inanimate piece of weoponry that drives the action. 73 opens with the gun of the title privileged, on display behind a glass window, while its admirers are trapped, squashed, undifferentiated, framed, admiring it outside. throughout the film, human power is reduced to the most arbitrary of signifiers - names change; lin and dutch mime shooting each other because they've no guns; quests lose their moral vitality and their practitioners veer close to madness; armies have to ask for help from confederate strangers to fight battles; a man becomes worthy of respect only when he mentions his name; another man is revealed as a coward when he abandons his fiancee to the indians; the gun retains its prestige, power, wholeness.it's not the revenge plot which drives the film, but the story of the gun; this wrenches the film out of conventional expectations, and creates an eerie, alienating, modern feel. we become so caught up in the revenge plot that when we follow, with the gun, another plot entirely, we feel slightly bewildered.this emphasis on the gun, symbol of potent masculinity, actually allows for a critique of that masculinity, revealing pointless elaborate rituals at the expense of society and order; brute capitalist greed; murderous indian-traders who defraud both seller and enemy; cowards; psychotic killers; before returning to its 'true' owner, a broken hero thoroughly compromised, who has become as murderous as the murderer he seeks. the gun is never imprinted with the name of its owner, not only because there is no fixed owner, but because there is no fixed masculinity, an insight anathema to the traditional western.73 brilliantly invokes western myths - wyatt earp, dodge city, the cavalry, the civil war, the wide open west - only to undermine them. earp has an inflated reputation that is all name but never proven - dodge city is no safer against outlaws than anywhere else; the cavalry is inept (custer has just lost little big horn) and the bitter feud of the war is shown to be irrelevant. the myth of the open west is a site for a very closed, inescapable, circular plot which traps its characters, refuses to allow them shape their destiny, but allowing it to shape them.the old john ford silhouette of riders on a vast mountain is reprised, but signals here not progress but repetition and circularity. but for all its deconstruction, the film is also tangibly vivid in a way few westerns ever achieve. mann's incisive technique intrudes his camera in crucial positions, alternating revealing distance with intense examination, making the saloon doors and stagecoaches seem thrillingly alive and lived in.

for anthony mann the western was 'legend'- and 'legend' makes the very best cinema! mann's work was full of intensities and passions, visually dramatic, and the action always excitingly photographed...stewart, a docile actor with the ability of displaying anger, neurosis and cruelty, made with anthony mann, five remarkable westerns: "winchester '73;" " bend of the river;" "the naked spur;" "the far country;" and "the man from laramie."in "winchester '73," stewart reveals his darker side... he offers all the reserves of anger, inner ambivalence, and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had, up till this time, failed to catch...a carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style: shelley winters is at her saucy best; dan duryea perfect as the vicious, sneering psychopathic villain; john mcintire great as the unscrupulous character; charles drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor; and a very young rock hudson, attempts the role of an indian chief... "winchester '73" is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized, rifle in the dodge city kansas of 1876... stewart and his estranged brother, who bears another name (stephen mcnally), compete fiercely for possession of it, and though stewart wins, mcnally steals it and sets off cross-country with stewart in pursuit... what gives the pursuit an element of the demonic, is stewart's determination to revenge his father's death at the hands of that same renegade brothera revenge fed by long-standing fratricidal hatred...photographed in gorgeous black & white, the film comes on as powerful and arresting, acted with deep feeling and intense concentration, not only by stewart but by all the supporting characters...look fast for a promising newcomer, tony curtis, the soldier who finds the rifle after the indian attack...

my favorite movie genre is the western, it's really the only movie genre that is of american origin. and despite sergio leone, no one does them quite like americans.right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is winchester 73. it was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director anthony mann and actor james stewart. it was also a landmark film in which stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from universal. many such deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.anthony mann up to this point had done mostly b pictures, noir type stuff with no real budgets. just before winchester 73 mann had done a fine western with robert taylor, devil's doorway, that never gets enough praise. i'm sure james stewart must have seen it and decided mann was the person he decided to partner with.in this film mann also developed a mini stock company the way john ford was legendary for. besides stewart others in the cast like millard mitchell, steve brodie, dan duryea, john mcintire, jay c. flippen and rock hudson would appear in future mann films.it's a simple plot, james stewart is obsessed with finding a man named dutch henry brown and killing him. why i won't say, but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of james stewart on screen. anthony mann reached into jimmy stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have.the hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film. after stewart and sidekick millard mitchell are disarmed by wyatt earp played by will geer because guns aren't carried in earp's dodge city. there's a shooting contest for a winchester rifle in dodge city and the betting favorite is dutch henry brown, played with menace by stephen mcnally. stewart, mitchell and geer go into the saloon and stewart and mcnally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there. look at the closeups of stewart and mcnally, they say more than 10 pages of dialog.another character stewart runs into in the film is waco johnny dean played by dan duryea who almost steals the film. this may have been duryea's finest moment on screen. he's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns. another person stewart meets is shelley winters who's fiancé is goaded into a showdown by duryea and killed. her best scenes are with duryea who's taken a fancy to her. she plays for time until she can safely get away from him. guess who she ultimately winds up with?there are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there ain't a sour note in the cast. john mcintire as a shifty indian trader, jay c. flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and rock hudson got his first real notice as a young indian chief. even john alexander, best known as 'theodore roosevelt' in arsenic and old lace has a brief, but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both mcnally and stewart stop at different times.mann and stewart did eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to do a sixth western, night passage when they quarreled and mann walked off the set. the end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.

24 has got to be the best spy/adventure series tv had ever aired. the whole idea of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period is dazzling. the style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it. and jack bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a tv series in a long time. i rate this, along with the simpsons and the x-files, my three most favorite tv series.this first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate us senator david palmer who is also running for president. bauer is called to his office in order to discover who is behind all this and, at the same time, figure his daughter's path to the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom. thus, begins an adventure on the best political style and, what's best of it, is that it always takes place in real time, which makes this tv series a real work of originality in a time where almost every program on tv seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over.

24 is the best television show!!!!! it's an incredible tv series with an incredible suspense, excellent plots and unforgettable characters. and the first episode of all is my best evidence. because it's only the first episode, only the introduction, and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns.jack bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator david palmer. he can't trust in anybody because people of the ctu may be involved. and, when this events occurred his daughter: kimberly escapes from house to a party. but...at the end of the episode, you want to watch more, and more, and more. it's only the first of the lot, and it's excellent.

the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time i saw "24". the speed things are happening is amazing, and it's so surprising, thrilling, and even interesting, it's almost as if you are reading a book; once you start it, it's very hard to stop. from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu, i was sitting 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes!!! (sounds funny and crazy, but i'm the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can't stop)this series is one of the best of it's kind. and it's build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together. recommended in every way!

"addictive" is an adjective i've heard many times when talking of certain tv shows. most recently, dramas like lost, heroes and prison break have earned that description. however, as compelling as they may be (and they really are) i can wait a few days before i see the next episode of either series, even prison break which some have lazily classified as "the new 24". with all due respect, there can be no such thing, and for a good reason: no other silver-screen thriller is based on a real-time structure. that's what sets 24 apart from any other show, and that's why i practically have to watch an entire season (on dvd) in seven days or less: once the frickin' clock starts ticking, it's impossible to tune out.an episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of nypd blue (and, more recently, deadwood); having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours, one per ep (the actual running time is 41 minutes; the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly), was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since hill street blues introduced non-linear storytelling (a mandatory element nowadays). and it truly paid off.ironically enough, the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding (fortunately, creators joel surnow and robert cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller), which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere: looking extremely relaxed, jack bauer (kiefer sutherland) is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter kimberly (elisha cuthbert) and, minutes later, being tender with teri (leslie hope), the wife with whom he has just reconciled. as in the sopranos, though, something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner: not only has kim snuck out of her room, jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately. at midnight? i'm afraid so: bauer is a ctu (counter terrorist unit) agent, and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of david palmer (dennis haysbert), an african-american presidential candidate who will be in los angeles for the whole day (oh, right, i almost forgot: events occur on the day of the california presidential primary). no time for napping, then: jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case. unfortunately, he has a tendency to ignore protocol, and that doesn't sit well with george mason (xander berkeley), a slimy man from division who has been asked to interfere with the operation.the plot is very dense, making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span, but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly: the writing is sharp and precise, the attention to detail unsurpassed, and the suspense is consistently sky-high, mainly thanks to the real-time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level.another great quality of this pilot is the characterization: most genre shows (sci-fi and thriller) tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on (a textbook example is csi, where character development is minimal, but then again that matches the show's unique style), whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people, among whom jack (sutherland's best role - ever!) and palmer (the real revelation of the show) stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only (the former divided between job and family, reckless but humane, the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity). a couple of supporting parts border on stereotype (mason and tony almeida especially), but two factors ought to be taken into account: a) this is the first episode; b) there's so much going on most viewers won't even complain about a "flaw" or two. after all, how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy, a missing teenager and a huge explosion - and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season?tick, tock, tick, tock...

on the day of the california presidential primary, between midnight and 1:00 am, the spy victor rovner sends a message from kuala lumpur to usa. meanwhile, in los angeles, the federal agent jack bauer has returned to his family and is having trouble at home with his teenage daughter kimberly, who blames her mother teri for putting jack out of the house. teri and jack decide to have a serious conversation with kim, and they discover that the girl has run away home. while trying to solve his domestic problem, jack is called to his counter terrorist unit by his colleague nina myers for a meeting with their chief richard walsh, who discloses a menace against the life of senator david palmer, who is running for president, and they need to find the shooter. later, walsh has a private conversation with jack and tells that there is a conspiracy in the agency against david palmer, and assigns jack to find the conspirators. when an airplane explodes over the mojave desert, jack has one additional issue to worry about.the first episode of "24" is a promising beginning of a successful series, introducing jack bauer. this is the first time that i have watched this show and i confess that i liked what i have seen: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. kiefer sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a reliable agent in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: find a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and find his teenage daughter, who is getting in trouble, while trying to save his marriage. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "12:00"

i was never a big fan of television until i watched 24 for the first time. i got into the series very late. season 5 ended before i even saw my very first episode. it was an episode of series 3 that was on my parents dvr (digital video recorder) box while i was house sitting for the weekend. it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer. and boy was i hooked!! i watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i've ever spent. i watched the first three seasons in three weeks. that's 72 forty minute episodes!!! i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week. i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season 6 week to week!! i find it mildly torturous and cruel but i'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america!! the dvr is set and you can bet i'll be chomping at the bit!!

overall i was rather impressed with the pilot. the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o.c but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle.bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext, there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose. here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films/television shows, which deal with the subjects i referenced, i think you will find at least something here.in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way, i especially liked how they explained where the cylon's belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers.the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays 'lacy rand'. while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something i think needs work. i also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop, but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident.based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where 'caprica' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did.

a prequel to the re-imagined battlestar galactica series, from the same creative team ronald d. moore and david eick as well as new series co-creator remi aubuchon. caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of battlestar galactica. the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the cylon race.the pilot and the series are set to follow two families; the graystone's which include daniel (eric stoltz) a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter zoe (alessandra toreson), while the adama's include joseph (esai morales) a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica.like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric stoltz, esai morales and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including alessandra toreson and magda apanowicz.for fans of battlestar gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different. in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series. the scenes on caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel, this is achieved through some of the architecture, the costumes and the way it is shot.while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg is far more important. we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one, as well as issues related to crime and government.the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv, the series is set to start in 2010.like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in vancouver

just as the new bsg wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting, caprica may not deliver what fans of the new bsg were expecting (for the most part). it is a very interesting, if not somewhat self-involved show, or at least the pilot is.if you're looking for the big cgi thrills of the (new) bsg, you'll be sorely disappointed. if you liked the drama, you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with.the storyline does examine on how the cylons were developed, why adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. the writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing god(s)' and the creation or re-creation of 'human' life. it will be interesting to see how this plays out.i found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others, but all in all it was promising. a small part of me wishes (or hopes) there might be some minor inklings of bsg in there (aside from the back story i mentioned), but that would probably convolute the storyline too much. like bsg, i'll have to wait and see if caprica grows on me, but it's way too early to tell.it would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but i'm willing to give it a chance. overall, i thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the (proverbial) towel'.

first off, this is an excellent series, though we have sort of a james bond effect. what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, dr. no (1962) being the second, while in golden eye, the first film with pierce brosnan, judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male "m" so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double-0, aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? this is more or less a "poetic" license to thrill. we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained. no, the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago. in the 1960's communicators were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. omg, do you think 400 years from now, they would have perfected rogaine for jean-luc picard? so, please, let's give the producers some leeway.but to try and make things a bit consistent, let us just ponder about the cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica. if that is the case, where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from? we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. well, what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship, loaded with human-looking cylons, wound up not only jumping through space, but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one. they colonized it, found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves, but not before they themselves sent out a "ragtag" fleet to search for the legendary caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, which they colonized to become the humans, who eventually invented the cylons. time paradox? of course. which came first, the chicken or the road? who cares? it's fraking entertaining!

this is one of those film's/pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps, but isn't necessary. what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isn't something so far away in the future. this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically. the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced & quite talented actors. eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is & he'll do it no matter the cost. paula malcomson of "deadwood" fame is terrific as his wife as well. you are not sure completely of his motives whether it's love or money or both, but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani & her performance. esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again & just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. i didn't think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story. it's great to see adama as a child already being affected & influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage. i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots. this is an almost perfect pilot & i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling. even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. if you haven't gotten into bsg, @ least try this & i'll bet you become a fan & will want to see how the bsg story came to be.

of course the average "sci-fi" battle star gallactica fan will hate this. that kind of makes me happy. i don't like those cheesy sci-fi shows especially battle-star gallactica and that is why i like this show.the creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this (the unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. i read on wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci-fi nerds.this is probably the most promising show since lost. it has the most interesting, clever, and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique.what i love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great anime! from young teens running around shooting guns, to and extremely well balanced and complex script, to robots it reminds me of something that came from japan except a little bit better (most anime is too confusing).

the caprica episode (s01e01) is well done as a pilot. really, this episode is the exact same content as the dvd pilot release. that having been said, episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular "battlestar galactica" series (both the original and the 2007 remake). it significantly applies most to the 2007 series. as is the trending plots of sci-fi of late, this series explores "virtual" life or environment. on top of this, we are given much background on the adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed (in the battlestar galactica series) creator of the cylons. to the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular topic of "virtual" life and (as is expected) early life of the colonies, and the birth of the cylons. over all, i rather enjoyed this episode. although, it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the dvd release of the caprica pilot, the series seems very promising. as is the case with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience (sci-fi community). i'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development. i give this series 8 stars.

bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series. i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season. it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was! as soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title - caprica! although, some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed. there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why.i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology, and alternate fantasies of our world. this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more!

i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review! i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica ( being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe )so i didn't know what to expect...but i did come out with a smile though i must admit...the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters...i won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this.must say...esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama...(father of the admiral in battlestar galactica)i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg...also eric stoltz fits his role precisely...! special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome! don't sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it..without having to have see bsg!.this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci-fi kick!

if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10. i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world. subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise, but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better. the production values are incredible and the acting is first-rate. i don't mind that it doesn't seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, they are two different shows. i'm thrilled that both esai morales and one of my all-time faves, eric stoltz, are back in my life (if only weekly) as i've missed them both. this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing. you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in plot lines, characters and, of course, the various virtual worlds. we all know how it ends, but the journey is looking to be quite a ride.

i haven't seen bsg, i tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it. however, i saw caprica rebirth yesterday i felt a little lost, so i decided to watch the pilot today and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now i want to watch bsg as well.but what i really liked is that i didn't have to be a hardcore bsg fan to understand what's going on in caprica. from what i have read in the net, they were trying to reach the female population since bsg reached way more men, and at least in my case it worked.however, i suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot.

im really addicted to caprica, because it's a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica. it really has a slow pace start, but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air.i have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season.this sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres.eric stoltz does an amazing job, as well as polly walker as clarice willow!!totally worth checking out!!catch caprica on fridays at 9pm/8pm central on syfy

well i have to say that i have waited for it to come.i won't try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot. on the other hand i'm not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be bsg fans and not like the pilot.what the frack did they expect?!! the background is setting 50 years before bsg we are there o assist at the birth of the cylons, see the life of the adama family (has we already knew some of it from bsg), get a deeper explanation of the caprican population and its perception of the other colonies, and potentially the origins of the gods belief of the human and the unique god belief of the cylons. i do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series, i make the difference between the two although i know that caprica will reinforce bsg.this is 1h30 of promising start, i believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as bsg. i expect a lot from the following but i have no reasons to doubts that we will learn a lot more.watching the dvd's deleted scene also gives more material for your brain to chew on.looking forward to january 2010

this is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on tv at the mo.i was impressed right from the start. don't be put off if your not a sci fi nut (like me...) this could be happening on earth, the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. there are no space ships or laser guns (none yet anyway) so far i've seen up to s01 e04 and i'm gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities.the cast play there roles with pasion. eric stoltz is especially strong.this show really stands alone well, it doesn't matter if you watched bsg or not, in fact they are quite different. i've read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but i would say ignore them.this is a really positive start to a show. lets hope they don't cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days.

i must admit, i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by ronald d. moore wielding the retcon-wand.i was wrong!the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. the accessibility is marvelous! of course, seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the bsg pilot). the pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.don't be mistaken: "caprica" is not bsg. we are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. the casting maintains bsg's standards; stoltz and morales are simply astounding. morales' portrayal of joseph adama, inspired by olmos' portrayal of william, gives a wonderful glimpse of william's heroic father. stoltz's portrayal of dr. graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsg's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.

to all the haters out there: condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages. that being said, i was a huge fan of bsg, thought it was some of the best tv drama (not just sci-fi) on the air. but it was time for it to end and the story to move on. i liked the bsg epilogue "the plan", but it raised as many new questions as it answered, so i eagerly anticipated "caprica" and i was not disappointed.i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg, and i was pleased that "caprica" is something different, and i personally found the story exciting, in a different way than blazing space battles, explosions and sci-fi special effects (don't get me wrong, i like that stuff too). eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances, and alessandra was just wonderful. i can't wait until next week.

good show.the basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. there is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced. mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys? there is moral decadence in a virtual world. there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. i predict (based on the bsg background) that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery. in addition to this, there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves.this show is not bsg -- at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making. there are not a lot of shoot-em-up or space-based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far.what it does have are very good stories, characters, and themes. it also has good performances from the actors. they can make a culture which is similar to modern-day society, but alien at the same time be completely believable. like bsg, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potential, and flaws. it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties, antique cars, and chicken. but those things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point. whether you are from a mafia-style culture or an affluent and high-tech culture, humans and human nature aren't that different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see in the world today. wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.

i loved it, having been a fan of the original series, i have always wondered what the back story would be - it didn't fail to delight me. i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didn't recognise one person - this is refreshing, much like bsg. it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can't wait for the series to start airing. well done to ronald d. moore and team - excellent job. the special effects, dialogue and acting were all spot on, and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline. i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment, but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci-fi stuff produced in the last decade.

i was blown away by the re-imagined battlestar galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. a hardened sci-fi fan, i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs, and this was good stuff.as such, when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut. i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica, which wouldn't work at all. bsg's story, of a mournful ragged band of survivors, trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors.caprica feels different. where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization, caprica portrays that civilization in it's cold and decadent heyday. the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. in true bsg form, caprica has in it's first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul.the casting for caprica is also excellent. each character is unique and deep, from the obsessive and distant scientist-turned-entrepreneur, to his troubled and willful daughter, each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles.music, which was used so powerfully in bsg, also plays a significant role in caprica. battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well. caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show it's own feeling quite distinct from either of it's predecessors. the new caprica is definitely it's own show, pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs. i look forward to the full series.

i have to say, as a bsg fan i wasn't exactly sure what i'd think of this show. i saw it on the big screen at the arclight cinema tonight (as part of the paley center screenings), and the cast and film makers spoke after-wards. ron moore said they 'wanted to make a clean break from battlestar, and do something different, and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they'd gain others". even without their talk, i am now a fan of the new show. but here's what i thought of the film.i loved it. it was really very good. i guess i'm a true sci-fi (or 'syfy' - do i really have to type that?) geek, because i'd totally watch this as a series. it has a strong and rich story, and kept my interest. it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something, which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing. the actor playing "ben" should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs. the actress playing "zoe" seemed a little posy, but she was playing a teenager (and i'm sure i won't be the only one who thought "zoe" was a cylon at first, perils of being a bsg geek). if they're hoping these will be the new bamber/helfer/park, they may want to rethink it. surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.eric stoltz gives a stellar performance as daniel greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go. he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters, traps her, then dismisses and releases her. no sign at all of the 'serial killer' he played on gray's anatomy, really impressive acting.equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is paula malcomson as his wife amanda greystone. she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as stoltz's part, and i completely believed that they are a couple, and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship, something rarely seen these days. i look forward to seeing what happens with this family, and hope they give her as much to do as roslin in bsg- she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid, you cringe, it's really great. not to mention her eyes, which could hold magical powers, that's how intense they are. the scene where she takes on the government agent- very short scene, but beautifully played- really gives you an idea of her power.the other part of the show that did not work 100% for me were the scenes with esai morales, and the mafia type clan of his. he does a good job overall, but i did not believe in this mobs power, nor intimidated by their threats. i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the godfather, they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit. but given time, i can see how this will develop into an interesting 'upstairs/downstairs' kind of thing, with the poor minorities (morales et al) versus the rich folk who rule the planet (stolz et al). and to be honest, i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene.note to bsg fans, the boy playing 'willy adama' doesn't really look much like olmos, but he's just a kid. whether or not he'll be featured any more than he was in this film, who knows? i sure couldn't tell. but it didn't bother me, because he wasn't as interesting as everything else going on around him.polly walker plays 'sister clarice', and she's chilling and odd in every scene she's in. i'm not sure where she'll go or who she'll end up with, but i was very impressed with her acting. in this film she was sort of on the side, but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on. she was nothing like her character in "rome", something i always find impressive in actors.one nice surprise- the music is actually better and less obvious than bsg, even though it's the same guy doing it, bear mccreary. it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise, i'd buy this score if i had the chance.as to the 'panel discussion' after the show, it was hosted by seth green. ron moore was very smart and articulate, david eick was cracking wise (much like his video diaries), esai morales told a long story about how he was cast, and eric stoltz was very funny and didn't really answer the questions ( but i've always had a thing for him). paula malcomson was tough (she took seth green to task for mistakenly saying she was on '24'), and the girls who played zooey and lacey were both darling. grace park and tricia helfer were there as well, answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on bsg. overall a very interesting and wonderful evening.i'm giving the show a 9 out of 10, and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold.note: i just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the holoband was originally made for. i have no idea what that may be, but it holds a great deal of fascination to me.

cusack does his best david niven in this one, although i don't know if anyone besides me noticed it.when seen with this in mind, its a deliciously over saturated 'wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d*mn funny' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic.hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond. the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot - interesting choice.i never knew how soothing montel's voice was until this movie... i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs!

got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date, with an excellent performance for cusak, tomei, and all the supporting actors.excellent plot, very well-placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end. the action scenes were well filmed & choreographed. very funny.all in all i give this film a big thumbs up. it's extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle-east, and as such, it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour. indeed, at places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic.

this is a brilliant political satire. no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u.s.: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.another good film from this era, rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, accurately, that the u.s. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.a clever plot, good acting, some big stars (john cusack, ben kingsley, marisa tomei anyone?) and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit. unfortunately, americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.

"the first war to be 100% outsourced." dan ackroyd's line says it all. this is a hard to describe film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. it reminded once or twice of dr. strangelove, especially so in the scenes featuring ben kingsley (who did a remarkable job i think). i had no particular expectations of this film, though i am a big john cusack fan, so i just let the movie wash over me. and as a result i was quite entertained. the political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the us military-business complex. the sub-plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile. i can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the us, but for the rest of the world, it is a timely tale.

war inc. is a funny but strange film. the actors are likable, the film is likable also, but i don't know how to describe the plot. i will go into the plot later on. this is a movie with some weird casting choices. besides john cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked. here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that. her character is odd. there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants. and hits on hauser(cusack). there is a twist in the end involving the two characters. it makes sense.that is the only casting choice i am going into. cause it just plain strange. the whole movie is strange. but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored. here we have some of the best actors out there. excluding miss duff. she ain't great. but here we have john cusack, marisa tomeii, joan cusack, ben kingsley. see what i mean?this is the story of a hit-man named hauser(cusack). he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif(not the actor). while trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help out the wedding of a popstar(played by hilary duff). and he falls in love with a news reporter(played by marisa tomeii). there is a thing about the popstar though. hauser is disgusted by her. there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up.the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why. the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming. but that doesn't matter. this is a strange, funny, and entertaining comedy. i love most of the actors. so really, how could i not recommend it?war,inc.:3.5/5

this movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) it contained great backdrops and sets. 2) it showed the disparity of a war-torn environment alongside a technological one. 3) john cusack's acting was terrific. he portrayed angst very well. 4) it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects. i was also impressed with the acting for the most part. hilary's acting was, i found, the most stilted. the morals and values of everyone in a war-torn situation are up for grabs. the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. great stuff. psp

war, inc. (2008) **1/2 john cusack, marisa tomei, hilary duff, joan cusack, ben kingsley, dan aykroyd, sergej trifunovic, lyubomir neikov, ned bellamy, (voice of: montel williams)a hit-and-miss-21st century "strangelove"john cusack  who co-wrote the script with mark leyner and jeremy pikser  stars as a jaded hit-man named brand hauser who is burnt out but decides to follow thru on one final assignment by icing a middle-eastern oil minister named omar sharif (yes, not that omar sharif but you get the tone here from this misfire for a laugh) commandeered by the ex-vice president of the usa (aykroyd, cusack's old "grosse pointe blank" co-hort, doing a mean dick cheney manqué turn here), enlisting brand to do the deed under the guise of a trade show producer in mythical turaqistan (read: iraq/afghanistan) for the american private corporation tamerlane (read: halliburton). while being briefed brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he comes across intrepid journalist natalie hegalhuzen (tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. meanwhile tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of eastern european teen sensation yonica babyyeah (a surprisingly decent duff aping her own celebrity with tongue- through-cheek) and the idiot son of the country's leader.what follows is a bold attempt for a 21st century black comedy a la "dr. strangelove" but for all intense and purposes there are sadly more misses than hits in this broad try for laughs amidst political message (an unjust war being outsourced by american capitalism, check!) while cusack riffs on his martin blank from the aforementioned "pointe" he does add some nice touches of his man in black (he does shots of tabasco sauce to take the edge off), the rest of the cast plays catch up (except sister joan who is a riot as the high-strung aide- de-camp for hauser and has one of the film's funniest laugh-out lines: "my mass communications skills are finally paying off") for the most part. cusack visited the iraq war earlier this year in the 180 degree different "grace is gone" and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve ; while admirable overall the film's pace and rhythms are off largely no-thanks to first time filmmaker joshua seftel making his directorial debut here (and it is noticeable) except for maybe the well-choreographed fight hauser is involved with babyyeah's idiotic fiancé's entourage.a nice attempt yet a misguided failure ; maybe next time cusack won't try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself.

first, someone mentioned here that because this was released in "limited" quantity it means that it should be bad...that is exactly what the "big five" hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can "pass" or "ignore" features that are not desirable, without loosing face or imagine by censoring them directly. to the point, this production has been released "limited" because is considered "unpatriotic" by certain individuals.now i absolutely loved this feature; i find it way better then "charlie wilson's war" even if it is a "fictional" account of something that "never" happens but is always so obvious.this goes to anyone and everyone interested or affected by present american foreign policies, "home" or "aboard". the "turakistan" country and "the emerald city" are definitely trying to resemble iraq and baghdad just as much as the corporation "tamerlane" goes for "haliburton" (with the vice- president dan aykroyd playing dick cheney, lol).there are quiet a moments actually where the movie is dead serious, not even sarcastic anymore (main example would be as how john cusack character deals with his depression, but not only). i found that all the characters can be related to something/someone or specific stereotypes. now word of advise; if you are not politically active, especially towards the aspects of "globalization" , you will likely not enjoy this feature much since most of its content and inside "jokes" are targeting certain "personalities" that are not "visibile" to the general public on daily bases...(main exception would be hilary duff that plays the well known materialistic pop star, need i say name(s)?). at its core the feature is an anti-globalization gig, period. the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance. joan has a line at one point that goes like this: "and here we have a book written by you know who, about how i conquered the world and resolved the issues with my dad".priceless)))the sister and brother cusacks play good together as always, same as in "grosse pointeblank" i would say a bit more "mature".marisa tomeihere does not show her butt and breasts to "impress" us (like she did recently in "before the devil knows you're dead"), but instead she has a very serious role, and manages to pull it off quiet well.many critics don't get it (can not do so, or do not want to). this is not a "regular" movie but more of a comic documentary. this feature stands to deliver a message and not to get oscars, or have "visuals" sort of getting the viewer into buying the latest "hdtv experience" tv sets...i have noticed even in my local papers that this movie gets bad re-views because is not "artistic", while pro iraq war movies get good thumbs up for being "balanced" apparently and "engaging".makes one wonders how much all the world mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guys...i bet this feature will prove a hit overseas as much more then it will in north america. as i mentioned before, it is all a satire about american foreign policy and how it has been hijacked by "special interests" groups... having the "regular" american soldier wearing the "tamerlane" corporate logo on its combat dress is pretty insulting but effective in showing reality as it is, or will be soon the way things go so far.some priceless shots: upon "liberation", the country gets invaded commercial advertisements; a hilarious scene about how future journalists will likely gather "news"("anything is got to be better then this x-box bullocks"))); soldiers dealing with their "frustration"; overall, i do not recommend this to "conservatives" or "hard core" patriots of some kind or another.this feature is not made to reach to the "minds of souls" of the people(as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do so).instead it contains a message well defined for realists, and towards some ideological goals apparently "always" short of realizing.

brand hauser (john cusack) is an assassin for the cia. he is ordered to go to the country of turaquistan, a nation that the united states has "liberated", and kill a businessman named omar shariff. this is because the american conglomerate, tamerlane, that is putting the country "back together" will not stand for shariff, an oil man from a neighboring state, laying down his own pipeline through war-torn turquistan. but, once there, brand runs into difficulties. one, he meets a determined journalist, natalie (marisa tomei) who wants to tell the american public the "true" story of the region's conflict...and of tamerlane. but, brand is aghast to realize that natalie's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to lose focus on his mission. also, his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop-singing princess, yonica (hillary duff), who will be getting married at the convention center. she is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn brand's attention away from the coming assassination. with other inept underlings and complications, will brand be able to carry out his mission, for the satisfaction of tamerlane's big boss, the former vice-president (dan ackroyd)? good for you, john cusack, to make this film, even though it doesn't quite hold together. shot in serbia, it is a worthy look at what present-day iraq must be like, a country turned upside-down. in a stroke a brilliance, the green zone here is called "the emerald city" and aptly so, for this oz-like neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis. the cast is very fine, with cusack doing a nice job and tomei, joan cusack, ben kingsley, ackroyd and others backing him up in style. duff, especially, does a great turn as the heavily-accented, heavily made-up, potty-mouthed singer. the recreation of war-riddled baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch. as for the script, it isn't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes. for example, a young turaqui boy offers to show brand an enemy hideout, in exchange for money and candy. brand produces the cash but, because he has no candy, the boy burns his vehicle anyway. brilliant! then, also, the direction is not a total success but doesn't lag very often. no, if you have conservative leanings, you probably won't like this film one bit. but, if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the "war on terrorism", this is quite a good show. therefore, do make an effort to view it, as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio "formulas".

on this 4th of july weekend it's heartening to see the spirit of the declaration of independence alive and well in the film "war, inc." just as our founding fathers gave the back of their collective hand to king george iii, this film exposes in hilarious fashion the craven war-profiteering by the current crop of capitalistic creeps who are intent on indecently privatizing the government, to include privatizing war itself.the cast in this satire absolutely shines. john cusack is wonderful as a droll, conflicted corporate assassin, and the beautiful marisa tomei is superb as his love interest. (my gosh, "george costanza" was right. marisa tomei is so attractive!) but it is john's sister joan cusack who really steals the film. her portrayal of a bossy, yet simultaneously sycophantic, personal assistant is priceless, and more than once i just couldn't stop laughing at the brilliance of her performance. she not only possesses fantastic comic timing, her face is as expressive as one could ever wish for in an actor. dan ackroyd, too, has a short, but very effective, cameo in the film as the head of the company which is running the war, the tamerlane corporation. sitting on a "throne" with his pants down around his ankles, ackroyd even looks like the arse clown who currently occupies one of our real thrones of power. you won't have to think too hard to recognize that person. much of this movie was filmed in bulgaria, which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment. (you just know that the us military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of war-profiteering.) i especially enjoyed the character of "omar sharif" as played by the bulgarian actor lyubomir neikov. in one scene in which he is on the dance floor with marisa tomei he has a couple of lines that could summarize our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we install - and uninstall - in power.naturally, this film won't appeal to everyone. if you believe that the on-going privatization of our foreign policy, the military, intelligence collection and analysis, prisons and the corrections system, public health, and a myriad of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film. if you believe, however, that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporation's bottom line is an abomination i think you'll find much to appreciate in this film. nothing could be more in keeping with the spirit of independence that heaping well-deserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be.

this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me. it's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film. it's plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film. the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff. it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the 'chick-flick' genre she's used to. her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed. it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary, and i have seen most of her films. her character, yonica babyyeah is described as 'the britney spears of eastern europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song, 'i want to blow you... ... ... up'. you also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, yonica is a very complex and confused character. joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour, but also her facial expressions and so on. john cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout. i strongly recommend this film.

in war, inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities we are currently doing in afghanistan and iraq. if you are familiar with the antics of halliburton, kellogg, brown & root and blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of cusack's latest piece. cusack plays a corporate hit-man named brand hauser who finds himself in turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target. while there he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by marisa tomei and pursued by the over-sexualized pop star played by hilary duff. we are introduced to hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named marsha dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him (and played hilariously by joan cusack). while some moments are played suitably over the top, they aren't always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise. all the principals turn in solid performances. duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her disney image. tomei is funny but understated while the cusack's own nearly every scene they are in. to be fair, they are given good material. the writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion. in fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns it's way to the expected conclusion.if you like your comedy broad and physical, there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie. on the other hand, if you like sly comedy and broad satire, this is for you.

this film needs to be seen. the truest picture of what is going on in the world that i've seen since darwin's nightmare. go see it! and if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd. the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through, though hardly perfect. joan cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is good too. it's inspiring that john cusack got this movie made, and, i believe, he had to use some of his own money to do it. it's a wild, absurd ride, obviously made without the resources it needed, but still succeeds. jon stewart, steven colbert, snl, even bill maher haven't shown the guts to say what this film says.

the plot of this film might not be extraordinary, but what makes the film really special, are its characters (and the actors who play them  of course!). i won't go into the details of the plot of the movie, but i would certainly like to say this  this film is not just for everyone! the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire. if you're not alert even for a second, you'll probably end up missing one of the subtle points. the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff - like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan, the advertisements on the tankers (which i almost missed) and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout.coming to the actors, john cusack has played his multi-faceted role very efficiently (what with him being the co-writer and the producer too) and he plays his character  hauser, the killer with a heart  exquisitely. cusack's done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank, but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb.however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff! i have always been a huge fan of ms. duff. but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she's playing in the movie. but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor. let's face it! the kid's growing, but yes, so is her talent! all those critics, who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act, will be silent for a while. hilary had to play a really complex character  tough on the outside, yet a sweet child on the inside  and she's done complete justice to it. she makes you laugh, and she makes you cry  to cut the long story short ('cause i could go on raving about her for ever) she's brilliant! marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too. especially, joan's hysterics are uproarious! however, i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster.in general war, inc. keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor, and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot. i would highly recommend this movie to all (and more so to hilary duff fans)!!! p.s. - i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon!!!

in this satire of the commercialization and 'lightheartedness' of war, john cusack plays brand hauser, an assassin sent to to 'turaqistan' to take out omar sharif, who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the us's own company. in addition to this, hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer, a wedding for pop princess yonica (hillary duff), and a nosy liberal journalist, natalie (marisa tomei).assessing the technical aspects: - the acting (by the main characters,at least) was good, as was to be expected. some of john cusack's dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it. . . maybe unrealistic is more accurate. joan put forth a great, and often hilarious, performance. marisa tomei, while i've never been a big fan of hers, was more than suitable for the role and worked well. hillary duff, however, was pretty terrible. they needed an attractive middle eastern (or russian, or whatever that accent was supposed to be) pop-star. unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with her.- like i said above, the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points, especially john cusack's dialogue. not much of it, mind, but some. the story also got a bit ludicrous at points, which is fine for a satire to a point, but it took it to a whole new level here. luckily, the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool, calm demeanor throughout, and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors.- joshua seftel, who previously had a drought of real credits to his name, did a fine job with a rather wide-spectrum film. he handled the small ($10 million) budget very well, stretching it to make it appear to be much more. seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story. . . with the painful and hard-to-watch parts of the real war (including slaughter of civilians, etc.).- as far as the general satire goes, its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done, especially the 'golden palace poker' ads on the u.s. tanks. at points, it becomes a little too much, but, in the end, it still accurate portrays what it's going for an a young 'mel brooks'-type of style.overall, the film is very well made for the meager budget and it's definitely worthy of a look. it won't go down as one of the great satires of cinema, but it's certainly not the worst.7/10.

i don't want to spend to long here rambling about the plot- you've seen the trailer, and if you haven't its online. i don't recommend seeing it though- it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughs or magic from the film. so those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance. it's really funny. i was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film. the first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics- my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad austin powers film in the final 20. this however, is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film (which is normally the case). everyone gives a great performance (especially joan cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout. i personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out- only to catch all the details which i was laughing over during the first viewing!

let me start by saying that "war, inc" is not everyone's cup of tea. it is, however, very enjoyable (and gets you thinking - "oh, crap"). the comedy involved the film isn't obvious at all - it's quite subtle (tamerlane tanks, dry-cleaning service etc), and it changes with the twists & turns in the plot.i may be the only one, but i won't compare this with "grosse point blank", because, it's different. john cusack - i wouldn't say he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. on the other hand, his sister (joan cusack) was incredible in her delivery of lines & comedic timing - even though she was hardly in the film (i'd say the same about ben kingsley).marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter, and manages to pull it off. hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah. duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (even though her accent is a tad unreal).overall, the film is what i would call "entertaining". it doesn't have a particular storyline, and it's quite silly at times, but it does have a subtle message. i'd say it's worth a watch.

joshua seftel's first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about just as the title suggests: the corporations effect on war.the film is about a mercenary (john cusack) traveling to turaqistan (not a real country, fyi) to help the american government 'get their message across' to turaqistan's leaders. he meets a reporter (marisa tomei) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter. somewhere in the mix, a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in. as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan's most important people (a son of the president), a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star, well, somewhat. the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar; no more than fifteen seconds later, the film hooks you. with it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics, the film's running time blows by you. the film has a lot more action than i expected, with the occasional scene of war, well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder. though the story isn't much deep, the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike.in the final act of the film, the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled. i thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and i could understand why. twist after twist is what the ending is all about, and like most films, it is a true hit/miss situation. regardless, the three writers on the film (mark leyner, jeremy pikser & john cusack) did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation overseas.joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the film's integrity; not reducing the material to the most redundant of films (which i was afraid would happen). seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could: he created a vibrant atmosphere, one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all. seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. no missteps here. hopefully, he takes on more directorial jobs, for he is one director to look out for.

don't mistake "war inc." for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. it isn't.this is an old-fashioned screwball comedy, with ridiculously coincidental plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by john cusack, joan cusack, marisa tomei and hillary duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content.you see, the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true. yeah, we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons, and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now -- but none of that is the point.here, all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon -- sometimes in genius ways -- as the backdrop for a silly romp, as john cusack's character (the hit-man with a heart) tries to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesn't trust him (tomei) and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage (duff). cusack's sister, joan, plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss.that's all, and it works. it's simple fun, but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs, then you might not find it as funny.for all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.

i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for. though it has its confusing parts of the plot, it doesn't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie. that being said, if you're not open to more liberal political ideas, then this probably isn't the movie for you. i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding. each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing. i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area, but that's intentionally done. john cusack is right in that although it's set in the future, it really makes you see the present.

i saw his movie in dallas, texas when it came out in 1986. i remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie. after seeing the movie i can see why. the movie was not bad, nor was it great. the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story. they created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga. my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of robotech masters attacking the earth. they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue. as a kid, i loved the movie. but unfortunately i haven't seen it as an adult and can't give a better review. looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and re-evaluate my stance on it. that being said, will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge? i love robotech and can't wait for the shadows chronicles.

contrary to popular belief, this title , to me at least, is not so very bad. in fact. i regard it as a favoured film of all time. the welding of stories wasn't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series, however despite all this, you can watch it quite happily. for a feature film of its day, the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable.the sound/audio track is a personal favourite of mine. nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their, now badly cast us dub, counterparts. the sync is perfect in every shot. i had a few issues with the casting for the 'alien' voices (please forgive the crude naming, it has been a while since i've seen it). otherwise however, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. i feel and believe in the characters of this movie. dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago. i loved the osd's from back then but the castings often let series down.at this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life. it has historical value to me, but even after seeing the original megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection.to my knowledge the title only ever made it to the us in texas. personally i think its a big shame. had the correct audience been subject to it, i think robotech the movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years. i am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title.watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows. however, without seeing the originals, a viewer wouldn't really notice. since the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it back in its day. the uk had very limited access to anime. laser discs were the most productive media. personally i like the way carl had the balls to at least push the genre. i mean harmony wasn't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised.despite the few picky faults people have had with this film, the eighties feel of it keeps me in love. if you watch megazone 23 now, to its original japanese audio, or the new dub, i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the osd. cast your minds back to the original bubblegum crisis dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to e.v.e.saying all this. this film's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market. personally, it spawned a collection for me. i'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet carl macek, ill shake his hand for the effort, and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime.

eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in egypt. really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century. i also didn't realize the series flopped. there is a second season airing now isn't there? it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill-informed or don't watch a show at all. it is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time. the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place, but that is to be expected from any show. the remainder of the first season is excellent. i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states.

i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well. it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant. i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time. i find it really annoying when people say that it wasn't historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right. a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next!! i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show! we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it.

this is a perfect series for family viewing. we gather around the tv to watch this on bbc america. it is an up-to-date version of robin hood and it appeals to children and adults alike. our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching robin's next exploits. we can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free "on demand" viewing.the wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. there is a moral to each story. it is entertaining. the violence is not over-the-top or needless. the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john william's feel to it. it is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair.there is so much garbage on television from brain rotting "reality" tv to senseless violence. you should take this for what it is and that is an updated "robin hood" not to be compared with the movie exploits of errol flynn. this is a gem to be enjoyed by all. parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. he is a robin hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight. maid marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the "night watchman." the sheriff of nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between billy joel and tim curry. guy gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad "guy". the only question we have is "where is friar tuck?"

i absolutely love this show, but i saw the second episode first. after watching the first episode i could see why people were turned off at first. the first episode's humor is not the best, and they struggle to properly start the series. however, i still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. the characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters. as a first episode, it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good. the episode is not bad by any means, but as the show progresses it becomes better and better, so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show.

sitting on the front porch of his burbank home, ted mapes told me that he and reed hadley wore the exact same size in every item of clothing except hat.ted, one of the greatest of the stunt men, said that every time zorro put on his mask, he was the one on the screen.that was a little bit of an exaggeration: there were times that zorro was obviously reed hadley, but in the stunts we can be satisfied it was ted at work.and what stunts! "zorro's fighting legion" is, as witness the comments here, one of the greatest of serials. it is exciting and generally very well made.reed hadley was a fine actor, and, as someone else commented, he made a very good fop.but, admittedly, it is the action that makes this movie so great.and what else could we expect, with direction by that excellent team, witney and english, with great music from the amazingly prolific william lava (the listing here says he was uncredited, but that is incorrect; those other composers listed here were indeed uncredited, and i don't know if they did write any of the music -- it sounds like lava), and with villainy from, among others, the great charles king, and with dozens of bit parts?also noteworthy was a villain played by the radio tarzan, jim pierce, who was edgar rice burroughs' son-in-law. (i urge you to read his mini-bio.) there is one chapter that slows things down depressingly, but, heck, it's only a few minutes long (maybe 20) and when you wade through it, well, you're back to the excitement.turner classic movies deserves a great big thank you for presenting this excellent serial, and we should ask tcm to bring us more.and we should thank everyone involved that we get to see it as a chapter-play, or serial, and not as a re-cut feature.

there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.zorro's fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films. first off, it's a republic serial in 12 chapters. and this time, zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks, tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workman-like actor reed hadley. while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call upon.another big difference is that the setting isn't california. the story here take place in central mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic. something, zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop.don't get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from corny "twang" bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. but overall, this represents one of the best republic serials of all time, and probably the best zorro one.the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and there's lots of great action - fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial.

serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. known as "chapter plays," they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes." each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week. the serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape.the audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again. serials were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.the golden age for serials was 1936-1945. this was one of the best of the era.zorro has been seen in many films, but reed hadley ("racket squad", the undying brain) was excellent in the role.the action is constant, and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.zorro triumphs, as he always does.

along with "king of the rocket men", this was still being repeated on bbc tv in the early to mid eighties. if i was loading up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in.someone watching it for the first time will think it is silly but this is one of the best examples of the "serials". don del oro will make you laugh (when i was little my nickname for him was mr dustbin head) and it was funny upon being shot at he says "your bullets can't harm me" then he stumbles back, seemingly less than happy. i also like the way he dispenses with sebastian in the first episode.i watched this again because i had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect including water,rockfalls,runaway carts... apart from the first episode(with ralph faulkner)the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as i remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable "flashback" episode! it gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace, padding and the other tricks. if you are interested in these serials i recommend the book by william witney, "in a door, into a fight, out a door, into a chase" although there is only a small entry about this series in it.

my very favorite character in films, but in nearly all of them the character of zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain`s can`t tell who is under that cloth then they are daft.but in reed hadley`s "zorro`s fighting legion" (serial 1939) the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who zorro really is.but anyway zorro is one of the best character`s in films and to bring it up to date l think anthony hopkins in "the mask of zorro" (1998) is a delight.my interest in films is vast, but l have a real liking for the serial`s of the 30s/40s....bond2a

best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials, period. this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico. the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic solvent. however a gold god, don del oro is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself. its zorro and his band of men to the rescue. reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps (most all of which were reused by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well).the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is. there is a reason that i've seen this the most of any serial i've seen, its simply a great action adventure film. the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with tyrone power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period. its super and highly recommended.

reed hadley makes a better foppish don diego than he does a dashing and daring zorro, but that's almost beside the point because this serial features the bar-none best theme song of any serial, ever -- and the best version of yakima canutt's famous stagecoach stunt. there are other good stunts, and lots of action, and plenty of hair-raising cliff-hanger chapter endings, but if for no other reason, you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt, then re-watch it in slow motion. it is incredible, and, despite the lower budget for this chapter play, yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film "stagecoach." indiana jones, eat your heart out: this is the real deal!

if you are a fan of zorro, indiana jones, or action in general this is a must-see. directed by republic's ace team of william witney and john english, and starring reed hadley as don diego/zorro, this serial delivers! i won't bore you with the plot (who cares? less talking, more fighting); what really matters here is hadley's superb interpretation of the character/s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt. ***stunt spoilers follow ***you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg -- zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash compactor in one chapter, trapped on a rope bridge a'la temple of doom in another, does a raiders horse-to-coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom. in addition to all this, the whip action is great as zorro disarms villains, swings to safety, etc. with his trusty lash. most of the sword work is fair to lame, except for chapter one, which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword/stunt legend ralph faulkner, who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez. this was the first serial i ever saw, on matinée at the bijou when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since. zorro's fighting legion delivers "z" goods!

god! zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as tarzan, and probably had about as many actors in the title role. this serial is one of my own personal favourites, and as previously stated,it is one of the top 5 sound serials. oddly enough, this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939.* by the time of this production in '39, zorro was really well known as a (pulp) literary and movie character. the film opens up with a little foot note about the history of the mexico's struggle for freedom from rule by a european monarchy, namely spain. the story invites comparison with the american revolutionary war.the story concentrates its attention to the mythical province of san mendelito and its 'council'. it is being addressed by benito juarez**on their gold mine's relation to the new republic of mexico. gold shipments must get thru to mexico city.don francisco uncle to diego vega, states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys.a thug from the don del oro mob, stages an 'insult' to himself and challenges don francisco to a duel with swords, don frasncisco getting run through.suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark 'z' on the face of the bad guy, he dispatches him to the hereafter. don francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward ramon (william corson) that zorro is his nephew from the city of los angeles. he also attempts to tell of the true identity of don del oro, but expires before completing statement.there is a big reception for diego at don francisco's hacienda, where diego disappoints ramon'sister (also ward of don francisco) with his timid act. "a fop!!", she declares.later,diego and ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers. when they ask, "who will lead us with don francisco now dead?", ramon declares "zorro, we are zorro's fighting legion!" well there is a big battle with the legion, now all clad on gray, with masks and capes, protecting the gold train. then zorro seems trapped at a man-made avalanche intended for the convoy, when, well, you know cliffhanger end of chapter one.wow! that was a lot of writing for one chapter, but like most other serials, the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line. let's just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good, well made, action filled chapters following.zorro's fighting legion has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action. we have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups. there is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of 'don del oro'. we had soldiers, renegade whites, hostile indians and the legion.in short, it's safe to say that there is everything one could want, and then some, in this serial. and, incidentally, they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any mexican accents.as to just what is there here that makes zfl stand out from the rest? what makes it different or unique? well........first of all, it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen. the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the cantina in chapter one. this is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound track.and yet there is one more feature that really sets the fighting legion saga out in front from all others. that is, the film not only has a heroic musical theme, but it also sports lyrics, yes, the legionairres sing! we hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! it really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing.when the serial was first shown on our local television (circa 1955), all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of reed hadley as belonging to 'captain braddock from racket squad, the tv series. mr. hadley had a very distinctive, deep voice.*** he also handled the role very well. his costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional.there is a small slip up. a sort of minor anachronism occurs by having benito juarez(carleton young)addressing the san mendelito council, as juarez was about 18 years old at this time (1824) and, though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in mexico's history, he surely hadn't achieved such prominence yet. his inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of warner brothers' juarez that year, which starred paul muni in the title role.this is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial, but also my favourite zorro film.* we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year, what with gone with the wind, mr.smith goes to washington, the citadel, juarez, the wizard of oz, of mice and men, one million b.c.,zenobia, we want our mummy all counted among the output that year.** once again, juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850, about 25 years later. also, the political sub-divisions are referred to as 'provinces' in the story. in actuality, they are called 'states'. just as we are called the united states of america, so too,south of the border they call their repubhlic the united states of mexico.*** reed hadley was prominent in some very 'a' pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect. watch & listen for his narration in the house on 92nd street (1945) and guadalcanal diary (1945).

i rank this the best of the zorro chapterplays.the exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play.there is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter.reed hadley does a fine job as don diego and his alter ego zorro.last,but certainly not least,is the great directing team of whitney and english.

i loved this exiting republic serial! the story was one of the best i have ever seen! even tough, the picture quality was not of the best, but ok. the fencing in this serial is also a bit bad, but not terrible. they only should have practised some more. as i said the story is great! you're just sitting there and waiting to find out who don del oro is! the theme music is excellent! it's the same guy who maid the music for walt disney's version of zorro, who maid the fightin legion music. costumes and buildings are very good. zorro is really cool and so are the legioners! i highly recommend this serial. buy it! i love that reed hadley plays zorro! he is funny, smart and brave! mark: 6.

as serials go "zorro's fighting legion" is one of the best action serials of the 1930s. made in a period when the studios could still field a large cast, this one has wall to wall action throughout its 12 chapters.in 1824 the president of the newly formed republic of mexico benito juarez (carleton young) is trying to put his new country on a solid financial footing. to that end, he has arranged to have rich gold shipments forwarded to the capitol from the local san mendolita mine.members of the local council plot to steal the shipments on behalf of don-del-oro a gold armored god, who with the aid of the local yaqui tribe, hopes to install himself as the ruler of mexico. opposing him is don francisco (guy d'ennery) who forms a legion of locals to aid juarez. when don franciso is murdered by don-del-oro's men, a stranger, the fopish don diego (reed hadley) arrives in town. diego aka zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends ramon (william corson) and juan (budd buster). the token heroine of the piece is ramon's sister volita (sheila d'arcy).both diego and ramon hold seats on the local ruling counsil. it soon becomes apparent that some of the other members of the council are in league with don-del-oro. first there is the chairman of the council (leander de cordova), the head of the militia manuel (john merton), chief justice pablo (c. montague shaw) and gonzolez (edmund cobb). zorro suspects that one of these men is don-del-oro, but which one?what follows are several hair raising escapes by zorro and his confederates from the followers of don-del-oro. we have the ever present collapsing rope bridge, the deep chasm between two cliffs over which only zorro can jump to safety, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires and coaches and wagons crashing or going over the cliff. hats off here to republic's fine team of stunt men lead by the legendary yakima canutt and the yrigoyens, bill and joe. canutt performs his signature stunt jumping on a team of runaway horses and then falling beneath the coach which he repeated in other films including john ford's "stagecoach" the same year.anyway, zorro finally unmasks the false god don-del-oro and restores peace to the valley before riding off into the sunset in chapter 12.others in the cast include jim pierce, curley dresden and charlie king as don-del-oro's hence men and if you look closely you may spot bits by future serial star and lone ranger clayton moore and stuntman canutt in bits. "big" jim pierce by the way, may be best remembered for playing tarzan in 1927's "tarzan and the golden liom" (1927) and for his marriage to joan burroughs the daughter of tarzan creator edgar rice burroughs.thoroughly enjoyable.

there have been several films about zorro, some even made in europe, e.g. alain delon. this role has also been played by outstanding actors, such as tyrone power and anthony hopkins, but to me the best of all times has always been reed hadley. this serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, don del oro, at its end. the serial also has good performance of various actors of movies b like ed cobb, ex- tarzan jim pierce, c. montague shaw, eternal villains like john merton and charles king, and a very good performance of hadley as zorro. he was quick, smart, used well his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any zorro.

this movie is completely ridiculous. not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrendous. the special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. yet, it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced. it is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any el camino's. there are also other aspects which i will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic. i highly recommend this movie, just because of its utter idiocy. i have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch exterminators of the year 3000!

robert jannuci,luca venantini, venantino venantini, alicia moro (two stars are from city of the living dead (i wonder what luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something, like bela lugosi jr. or david hennessey there kid from dark shadows who wants to forget dark shadows existed). anyway, in the thorn emi video there's no music over the opening credits . . . but the music is great once it comes in . . . with the italian movies the films aren't as good as the music . . . my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot arm following loner-alien through the desert. alien says why are you following me. tommy answers because i feel like it . . . alien replies which way are you headed tommy says west then alien says well, i'm going east. so after a while of walking, the theme playing in the background alien looks up and sees tommy sitting on a rock petting a pet hamster . . . tommy looks up and says to alien, what took you so long . . . i love this movie . . . it touches my heart. the boy with the robot arm needs a daddy and alien is drafted in to being tommy's daddy in the desert . . . oh yeah, they need water too . . . not the road warrior (mad max 2) by any means but a silly western/post nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and alien and trash and a few other good guys with a mean chick with an iron claw and crazy bull who looks like wez in the road warrior . . .on sunday afternoons on channel 57 (philadelphia, pa) after church i'd come home and find this on . . . often . . . too often. love it. 10/10

when i saw the exterminators of year 3000 at first time, i had no expectations for that movie. although, it wasn't so bad as i was thought. it's kind of italian version of roadwarrior, with cast, that is almost famous in italy, including venantino venantini. behind the story is elisa briganti and dardano sacchetti, who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh-eaters. you can also see other links to italian horror movies: luca venantini plays the role of tommy, and you can see that kid in paura nella citta dei morti viventi (city of the living dead aka gates of hell) as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of mary's brother. quite entertaining movie, with some dull parts.

i truly enjoyed this film. the acting was terrific as was the plot. jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for. the only part of this flick i would change was the ending. the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel.there were some interesting religious messages in this film. jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented the anti-chirst. there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that 'end of the world feel'. i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature. i know many people won't get the references to christianity, but if you watch close you'll get it.

this is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man type critter on an uncharted island, then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them! lots of bad gci, goofy plot elements, and babes sweating in tight t-shirts follow.these monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this one spices things up with a bit of humor (i guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek), not to mention the sexy babes. but let's mention those sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight t-shirts, sweating profusely. one's in her undies at the beginning, another at the end. thank you, thank you, makers of bad movies! the plot is full of goofy stuff, a guy drives up in a jeep, slams it right into a tree, then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter. yeah, um, well, how 'bout we think about that for a while; we'll get back to you. the sharkman is hilarious - either awful cgi or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit. the mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; he's evil, that's his motivation, he makes no apologies.overall, if you want a stupid, fun b-movie, this one should do the job.

poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... awesome. the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. haha. good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. i highly enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a good laugh. i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious. i can not, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. however, if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy, i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. very simply. so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. it brought some joy into my life.

like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title, michael oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous. the producer's last outing, "mosquitoman-3d" had the same problem. it's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it. the only draw for hammerhead: shark frenzy was it's passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface. but even that was only passable. poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish. with dolphins and whales, the technology is all but wasted. cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imax's stunning 3d capabilities. there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety. close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth. michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got shark-week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.

when i heard about "hammerhead" being released on dvd and finally found it at my local dvd store, i thought "well, just another cheap monster movie from nu image". those guys around boaz davidson and avi lerner produced cheap but very entertaining b - pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies. so i didn't expect much, especially after having watched the rather disappointing "shark zone" just a few days before. but "hammerhead" turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies. we have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, man-eating plants and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. everything you need for an entertaining monster movie. the only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie was made for tv it's understandable why these scenes are missing. and it doesn't matter anyway cause "hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment at it's best. there are two reasons why i gave it seven out of ten points, though: first of all, the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and secondly, william forsythe just isn't the right guy for the "hero" part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter tylo. other than that, i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there. grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. jasper p. morgan

for a low budget project, the film was a success. the story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. eva longoria, who now stars on the tv show "dragnet," is sexier than ever. the locations were ideal for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. although this film has it's share of problems, such as continuity, i must say that i would rent the director's next movie. if your a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's commentary.

if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show "desperate house wives" then you are missing out. eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon. this was eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting. she was 24 when she shot it, and looked hot then. as for this low budget film, it's pretty good for the first time director, who has another soon to be released movie "juarez, mexico" currently playing at many film festivals across the united states. in fact, it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news. what would be nice to see is a "snitch'2" with a higher budget.

ok where do i begin?... this movie changed my life! the plot was seamless. james cahill has out done himself. initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen. however this was before exploring the dvd's many features!!!! oh my god jakes cahill's commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting. he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience.i was so impressed by the other actors. the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway, reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. i am certainly with gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel.i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved, matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school... and possibly the guy playing a retard! all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years! where my oscars at dawn!!!!!!!!!!!

one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote "do you believe in love at first site?".a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture, further catapulting the films flawless integrity. gabby (aka joey) played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography. lol.the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young 'handicapped' kid with the speech impediment.. which i may add was acted to perfection! james cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day. the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic. when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm (cut throat mafia). this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming.personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future. thats if i can find it anywhere, lol!

where would one start a review of the film snitch'd? james cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man. his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking, and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1, and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear.cahill's grasp of effects, both visual and aural is electrifying, the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd, a real gritty like underground thriller. also, kudos to his brilliant use of makeup, such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue! yuck! i feel the world of film is much less from james' passing, his memory will linger on and on and on, reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, snitch'd. his insightful director's commentary released a coke-hit up the nose of any discerning film goer, truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets, captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl.but i ask you, why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap? i'll tell you why, because thats life in santa ana baby, its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices, oh no. there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft, tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children's production of double dragon: the play.the only qualm i have with this film, is that there was never a sequel made. come on steven spielberg, come on george lucas, come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23, how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man, james cahill.he discovered eva longoria you know. oh yeah, that he did.jonah

wow! this is a good movie! the acting wasn't good at all, but if you look at some moments in the film, rewind, and watch it again, it is genius! the man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. wow!i never expected that. then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. i bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. and the genius quotes: ''nice shades, i need a pair'' ''their yours.. if you think you can take them..''.. just brilliant! and the fighting is the best i've seen in a while. look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. what a hit! and in the middle of the film, one guy in a car shot one time, then 3 guys fall, he is really good at aiming. it costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. the end was brilliant, it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. jason peters falls down, and roll over again while he is dead! i can't say with more words how great this movie is!

this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever. ever. but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest. the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless. i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd's at my local pound shop. me and some friends then watched it, admittedly whilst rather drunk. it soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film. instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill's last film. at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered. instead we watched the film right through. at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream, something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours, whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons. we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed, this wasn't a work of abysmal film. this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at. this was a film that anyone can enjoy. this was genius.

i have always been a huge james bond fanatic! i have seen almost all of the films except for die another day, and the world is not enough. the graphic's for everything or nothing are breathtaking! the voice talents......... wow! i love pierce brosnan! he is finally bond in a video game! he is bond! i enjoyed the past bond games: goldeneye, the world is not enough, agent under fire, and nightfire. this one is definitely the best! finally, mr. brosnan, (may i call him mr. brosnan as a sign of respect? yes i can!) he was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game....... at long last! duh! i've seen him perform with robin williams, and let me tell you, they make a great team. pierce brosnan is funny, wickedly handsome ( i mean to say wickedly in a good way,) and just one of those actor's who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug, saying: "pierce brosnan, thank you for being james bond," "if it wasn't for you, i wouldn't know who james bond is." he's a great actor! i am a huge fan of willem dafoe even though i've seen him in a couple of movies. his role as nikolai diavalo was brilliant. (did i spell the character's name right?) lol!!!! he does a great job with an accent. sometimes i can't even hear an accent. i have seen willem, i mean mr. dafoe, perform in two movies: finding nemo, and spider-man with my favorite actress: kirsten dunst! she rocks! anyway, he never ceases to amaze. and richard kiel, wow, he's definitely got the part of jaw's nailed. i've seen him in the movie's and he's awesome! as a matter of fact, my grandparent's have met mr. kiel, and i was jealous when they told me. but, kirsten dunst is at the top of my list of celebritie's that i want to meet. john cleese was breathtaking. i have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking, and gadget creating q! mr. cleese was hilarious! i've seen him work with pierce brosnan in goldeneye and tommorow never dies. he's awesome! john cleese's most recent project is shrek 2 starring mike myer's, cameron diaz, julie andrew's and eddie murphy. ( shrek 2 is now in theatre's!) good luck 007! oh, yeah, and as q alway's says: "grow up 007!"

** warning - this post may contain spoilers **i only got a gamecube in september 2005, and the first two games i bought were james bond games, the decent agent under fire and the dull goldeneye rogue agent. the next game i planned to get was everything or nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games i already had. i have to say, he was right. i bought this for a tenner in hmv, and when i got home, i slammed it in to my cube and played it for hours on end. it was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. graphics were some of the best i have seen (but now that the xbox 360 has come out, farcry instincts predator has some of the best graphics known to man). the storyline was clever; mad man (willem dafoe, named as nikolai diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (heidi klum, named as katya nadanova), try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which at the start of the game, you, james bond, have to destroy on a train. the bad thing is that one of them is hidden in katya's boobs. you then have to thwart their plans and save the world.the great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters, such as cleese voicing q. there are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky.gameplay - 10/10 graphics - 9/10 sound - 9/10 replay value - 7/10 multiplayer - 8/10i give this game a grand total of 90%

goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history. their is no doubt about that. but this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern-day bond champ, of its time.this was not a bond game based on material from another medium. this was a completely new; scripted game. which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike, you'll enjoy it.unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. which gives it that more cinematic feel. with a very 'bond'-able storyline, you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie.enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done. with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. despite being quite old now, in video game years. it's still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life. even now just thinking about it, i've got the theme song stuck in my head. such a great cast and well-written storyline.the story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself. superbly done, in true bond fashion. which can only be named awesome, completely awesome.i've gotta go throw this game on now. if you haven't played it yet, you're missing out!

don't get me wrong. "goldeneye" was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise. but the series had fallen into a fps rut. enter "everything or nothing", which puts bond in third-person. when i wrote my earlier review for "from russia with love", i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly. even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise, eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv, driving an aston martin, driving a limousine that is wired to explode, commandeering two different types of tanks a la "goldeneye", riding a motorcycle, flying a helicopter, repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires, and free falling after a plummeting damsel. sure, vehicle controls are a little clumsy, but the issue here is the variety.as movie adaptations, "goldeneye" and frwl were all that i could have hoped for. but eon's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure. this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe, shannon elizabeth, heidi klum, and misaki ito. judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q, respectively, and pierce brosnan, while no sean connery, adds credibility to the game's proceedings. all characters resemble the stars, with the disappointing exception of heidi klum, who's in-game model doesn't do the real-life model justice. mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes.the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies. willem defoe's character is a former colleague of christopher walken's baddie from "a view to a kill". richard kiel appears as jaws, the hulking henchman from "the spy who loved me" and "moonraker" in three fight scenes, the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have.single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond. like bond, you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth, with plenty of wall and object cover. unfortunately, unlike frwl, only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging, so bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner, and vice-versa. the game also allows players to go into "bond reflex" mode. while you browse your inventory, everything around you will go into super slo-mo, allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. while this takes some getting used to, eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular "bond moments", such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath, and greatly add to the bond movie feeling.there are 3 available difficulty levels: operative, agent, and double oh. on operative, you can breeze through in a few hours. on agent, a few weeks. on double oh, a few months. the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear. some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints, but when all is said and done, no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie.multi-player, unfortunately, is not as thrilling. "goldeneye" still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game. eon's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond's. a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date. the ending, as with most bond games, is anticlimactic. while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game, the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. also, levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. still, for any serious bond fan, not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films.

this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because: the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good. the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do. this james bond game has a good story to it. the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool. also the graphics in this game pretty good.overall score ********* out of **********

this game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. when i got agent under fire, i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of james bond game. this time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond, william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo, and judi dench as m (forgive me all if i spell it wrong). this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around.i give this a 10/10

i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history... the antebellum years and the civil war in particular. i purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection. though not of the caliber of civil war films such as "glory" or "gettysburg," provides a lot of history on the pre-civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point.maybe it's the gray uniforms, the youth, or the military discipline, but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war. i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men, learning how to make war, then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates!actually, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in may, the other in june. the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention henry a. dupont, first graduate of the may class; and george custer, last grad of the june class. the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (i think the first class had attended five years, the other for four). as the movie portrays, cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other... george "fanny" or "autie" custer; alonzo "lon" cushing; james "beauty" stuart (for j.e.b. stuart, class of 1854), etc.i say this film is "santa fe trail" as it should have been because that 1940 film, while enjoyable, really fudges history. cadets from several different classes are all graduating together. jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping john brown's 1859 insurrection at harper's ferry. in fact, stuart and custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. they faced each other (for the first time, i think) at gettysburg in 1863 (stuart was at the harper's ferry raid, but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place)."fanny" custer plays a role in "class of '61," though his classmate chums, dev o'neill and shelby peyton are fictional. i believe they are respectively based on partick henry o'rorke and john pelham, two people you can look up.anyway, i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th century america.

two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though.some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils, hes still voiced by mark hamill which is a plus i guess. they made poison ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and catwomen looks much different and not as "attractive" as she was in the original.though costumes like batman, batgirl, killer croc and scarecrow look badass, especially scarecrow.the show isn't as dark as the original because batman doesn't work as alone as he used to. most of the time working with batgirl and the new robin, tim drake. while nightwing(dick grayson) comes to the rescue often. batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass.the show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "over the edge" might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out.overall 8-9/10

this is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman, mark hamil as the joker, etc. the villains are really good such as the joker, two-face, catwoman, clayface, etc. so i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good. so make sure that you watch it on tv or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good.overall score: ********* out of ********** **** out of *****

i liked it... just that... i liked it, not like the animated series... i love it!!!. the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate, but this cartoon was awesome, but it really didn't like it that much. there's too much people talking about bruce being so cold, but if this is around 5 years later, anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude, so to me it isn't a flaw. batgirl was awesome she really fit there, as there isn't more dick grayson as a robin, batman needed a good teammate, not like the new robin, he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child. but heres what didn't work: the new artwork... it isn't horrible but... to me it does'nt work in a series like batman. this is a dark character, with a maniac killer like the joker, so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon, the joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker (but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond:return of the joker) , so this joker isn't near as good. the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice. my favorite character: harley quinn (im in love for her) they put an awesome episode for her: mad love (to me the best episode of this series). here we finally know how she turned harley quinn, and how the joker twisted her mind, and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series, darker, no happy ending, brutal fight with the joker (but too short), this is how it was to be all the series. but in general i didn't like how she made harley in this series... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way, she get punched, she say nonsenses, she make flaws... c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her, not from her... and here they put ridiculous (like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper) so in general its a good series, it has it upsides and downs, the drawn could be better ( my good!!! kill that catwoman!!!!) nice sound effects, nice music, nice voices and nice episodes: my favorites, mad love, jokers millions, old wounds, sins of the father, and cold comfort. if you enjoyed batman:tas you can watch this but don't spec too much, in the other hand if you didn't watched tas, watch this first and then watch tas in that way you're really gonna love tas :d

the new batman adventures (also called gotham knights) takes place 5 years after the final episodes of batman: the animated series (b:tas) and only aired for 24 episodes. this isn't a horrible show, but it just isn't as good as the original batman animated series. i'll start with all the things that i found not to be very good.first thing's first, the animation itself: long and sweet, gotham isn't dark anymore, the sky is always bright red and orange, b:tas did this also, but it was drawn on a dark palate, do the colour of the sky was more ominous, in this show, the colour of the sky is too bright. it all just looks like any other kids show and doesn't seem unique like batman: tas did with it's dark, cool art style on gotham. the art style is ok, but doesn't remind me of batman anymore. every character is comprised of straight lines, squares, and triangles making characters look less human-like. in the original series (b:tas), characters look more like drawn versions of real people. the animation may be more consistent here than in b:tas, but it definitely isn't as good. next: some of the episodes seem too dumbed down and childish, but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in b:tas.(two-face attempting to kill tim drake/robin 2, and some villains get some pretty harsh treatment). this leads me to my next point.because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episodes of the batman animated universe, many villains do meet their demise or leave forever. poison ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes; two-face nearly kills penguin, killer croc, and himself, so he's moved to arkham forever; joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (though he will return later on the justice league animated series); catwoman moves away to france leaving batman, etc... just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters! the villains' motives are pretty bad, too. there are none! in b:tas, we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined, that's why they act the way they do, in this show, the villains are just committing crimes to progress the story. it's like batman just doesn't even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the people that he fights, he just beats them senseless. this batman is a colder and meaner version of the character, but since he's been doing this job for years, i can see why he is so harsh. next, the redesigned character models: they're awful. gordon slimmed down about 100 pounds... is he sick? many villains look stupid (joker, riddler, catwoman, mr. freeze, mad hatter, and killer croc are among the worst). although, i do think that some characters look better (bane, scarecrow, batgirl). harley is about the same, and ivy (who is even hotter now) has pale green skin.with the series having many faults, some episodes are great- over the edge, mad love, beware the creeper, girls night out, old wounds, legends of the dark knight, and never fear are my favourite ones here, in my opinion. all of the crossovers featuring batman in the superman animated series were great, also.the absolute worst part about this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. on the dvd features of the original batman animated series, they talk about how proud they were with the art style, and how difficult some characters were to animate, but they did eventually succeed with (the difficult animation necessary to animate clayface, for example). on the dvd features of the new batman adventures, the creators basically say "to hell with b:tas, this is a fresh, new re-vamp, it looks better and we love how we nearly ruined the series!" (alright, that is an exaggeration). when the creators cast away the amazing art style of b:tas, that really annoyed me!it's not a bad show, but i still don't like it as much as the original animated series. at least the show doesn't talk down to its audience, so for that reason, i still commend it. though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching. superman: the animated series, and justice league: the animated series are great follow-up shows to batman: the animated series and the new batman adventures, so give them a watch as well.

i loved this series when it was on kids wb, i didn't believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own. it was an interesting perspective to their relationship. i also liked the addition of tim drake in the series, and once again like it's predecessor this show had great story lines, great animation (better then the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. the only thing that i didn't like was that was when it was in the us it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline. i just wish some of the episodes could be longer. my favorite episode of any batman cartoons comes in this series, and it's called "over the edge", in my opinion as good if not better then "heart of ice" and "robin's reckoning." overall a nice follow up, along with superman this show made my childhood very happy.

dirty sanchez is the more extreme, british version of jackass in which the four boys (pritchard, dainton, joycey and pancho) go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other. the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny. there are 3 series of the show, the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg. there's an episode on their love lives,jobs etc. the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations. the third follows their european tour. it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series. in my opinion the third series is the best, but trust me when i say, if you have a week stomach do not watch, as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode.

i have to say although i despise these kind of shows, shock horror, i'm a girl, i feel i have to express my opinion. i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making. story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show. i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was, everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything. it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever, shockingly amateur. while drinking puke isn't really my thing, as far as a substantial entertainment show goes, dirty sanchez is way out of jackass's league.

i need to be honest. i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious, and raunchy. yeah, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards, for example then you will have a great time for it.or, if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad, you will also have a great time. and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh , you will enjoy the show.i enjoy all three kinds of humor that "dirty sànchez" offers. i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show. "jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass, give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show. with all due respect.this is a show that has little taste or class. it's not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out.now, these guys need to see a psychologist. specially the paco character.

i recently purchassed the very underrated dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on. i bought soul calibur (a classic) and then i stepped across the domain of resident evil code veronica. i have resident evil 1 & 2, and have played res evil 3 numerous occasions, and i have been impressed with all of them, especially no.1 which has to go down in history has a classic.but none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of brilliant gory gameplay. if its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort, ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me.anyway, the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which claire redfield searches for her brother (chris - from the 1st story), who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation. little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys.so aiding claire, with the assistant of super brat steve, u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother. the 2nd cd enables you to control chris, thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear.the control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic, when the character notices danger, he/she faces the direction it is coming from. pure genius!!overall i gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year, game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop!!. please purchase this game as soon as possible.

this game ranks above all so far. i had the honor of playing mine on ps2 so the graphics were really good. the voice acting was above standard. the difficulty level is just right. wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion. the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn't expecting. the only rating this game deserves is great.

i just can't believe that these games can get so much better, but they do. unfortunately i had to rent a dreamcast to play it, but even though i did beat it i can't wait to buy it for ps2. this is the only series of games that i must own all of them even if i have beaten them many times over. i hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an end.

one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed. great storyline with a romantic, horrific, and ironic plot. fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character! not to mention that the voice-acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series. don't miss out on the best of the series.

this is one of the best of the series, ranking up there with resident evil 3: nemesis (or biohazard: last escape) the game has a very good storyline in which you play as claire redfield in the search for her brother,chris redfield (whom you probably know from the original resident evil) it is as scary as the other resident evil, and contains alot more cutscenes.my rating: **** out of ***** stars (rating based on comparison to other videogames)

resident evil:code veronica is a great well made video game,it has great graphics,very comfortable controls,a great storyline and high fun factor.the storyline to this is claire redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on umbrella grounds,and reaking havoc at they're main lab while looking for her brother.code veronica's graphics are very good,the fire and rain effects are great looking.the controls are comfy,but the button pattern doesnt fit the dreamcast control,makeing it hard to get used to.its still fun going around some wierd disturbing place,shooting the guts out of zombies.code:veronica also has a little bit of "romance" between the two main characters.you also get to play as chris redfield,from resident evil 1.the sound in this game is better than ever,for example,even though i hate the new feature,when the giant spiders crawl,they're feet make a disturbing scampering sound,and the guns sound alot more realistic.great graphics,outstanding story,comfy controls,and realistic sound makes resident evil code:veronica a definite loved. i give it a 10 out of 10.

the third, and final installment of "hanzo the razor" is the most concrete of them all. the "training" even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film. not for everyone, this film details hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology. where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot, "hanzo 3: who's got the gold" manages to connect everything, and brings it all home in the end. definitely the perfect finale. oh yeah, hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of needless blood and violence (it *is* hanzo the razor after all).

who's got the gold? is (unfortunately) the last of the hanzo the razor films, starring shintaro katsu as the title character - the multi-weapon proficient, authority-bucking samurai officer with the "unique" technique of raping confessions out of unwilling female informants until they "spill the beans" and beg for more...this entry starts with hanzo "uncovering" a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake that's filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the treasury. this leads to hanzo discovering a loan-sharking scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. the requisite swordplay and rape/interrogation ensue - finalizing in a decent ending for this strange trilogy of films.not quite as strong and enjoyable as the snare (part 2 of the series...), but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and japanese pinky-style films. 8/10

shintarô katsu, who played the blind swordsman "zatoichi" in a total of 27 movies, ends the hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost, mako midori (blind beast).the big stick, used often in the pursuit of justice, is retired forever.katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to pay.the usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present, along with the blood.i'm going to miss him.

after the glories of the snare, it was unlikely that a further outing for hanzo would be able to do any better, and this doesn't breach that expectation, but it is a fine film and sits neatly in between the fun but messy first chapter and the terrific second in terms of quality and general entertainment. the screenplay comes from yasuzo masumura and has some parallels with the snare, as well as the expected hi-jinks of a hanzo film, but the film rings nice little changes on the formula by amping up the character driven humour as well as giving the film a quieter, reflective edge. the film opens with hanzos assistants scared by a ghost, and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have carnal knowledge of this ghost. it turns out that the ghost is serving as a guard for a stash of stolen coins and from this set-up unfolds a story of theft, corruption and usury, with expected violent and sleazy results. shintaro katsu is terrific as expected as hanzo, coming across effortlessly as a deadly fighter and sexual force of nature, he is equally good in the moments of knowing humour and likable, almost an ordinary gentleman in moments of drama, it is a beautifully rounded performance filled with social conscience and a touching edge of personal feeling. the expected comedy comes off fine as well, his moments with "snake" magobei are perhaps the most amusing of the series whilst his interactions with his servants are kookily entertaining as ever. though neatly laden throughout with nice moments, a fair amount of action and a little sleaze, the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach. there are shades of both prior films, the plotting, pace and smarts recall the snare and when the film aims for sleaze it does very well, with a potently handled and impactful early interrogation sequence. equally though, director yoshio inoue presents potentially sleazy scenes in a more experimental way as per kenji misumi's less well handled work in sword of justice, with consequences sometimes very nice, as with a man playing a tune on the koto, with close ups of his fingers plucking at the strings as unbeknownest to him hanzo ploughs his wife, and sometimes a bit weak, as with an orgy that is reduced to a nudity free psychedelic whirl of limbs in motion that just looks confusing. the nudity and bloodshed is generally downplayed which is a pity, though there is a little of both a stronger approach would have worked better, it is definitely the sort of film where trashy and unrestrained nudity and violence are most appropriate. but even with less in the way of exploitative goods this is still thoroughly entertaining stuff, the predictable moments are wrought with aplomb and there is more than enough intrigue and excitement, even some effective surprises to go around. its a film for the fans really, playing off the work laid down in the previous instalments and working sweetly if not spectacularly with it. altogether a near wholly pleasurable if mildly flawed end to a delightful trilogy, the second best of them and well worth a watch for enthusiasts of such things.

i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass, and i saw one or two episodes on freeview, and it is the same, only more extreme. basically three welsh guys, and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding, and a complete disregard/masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. they have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in stinging nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring, stunts in a work place, e.g. army, cowboys, and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves. starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything, lee dainton also up for just about anything, dan joyce (the british one) who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh, and pancho (mike locke) who does a lot, but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments. very good!

as much as i have enjoyed the hanzo the razor movies, three is definitely enough: 'who's got the gold?', the final adventure for the japanese lawman with the impressive package, is a fairly enjoyable piece of pinku cinema, but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as outrageousness is concerned.the film opens with the appearance of a female ghost, and looks as though it is going to explore supernatural territory, something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after the spook turns out to be nothing but a scooby doo-style ruse (cooked up by a corrupt treasury official keen to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold), director yoshio inoue is content to recycle familiar elements from the first two films, the result being a rather stale affair.once again, hanzo heads an investigation that requires him to interrogate women through the use of his mighty penis, slice up his enemies, and abuse his superiors. on the way, we get wild orgies, good-natured rape (hanzo forces himself on women who wind up appreciating his willfulness), and bloody sword-fights.if you've already seen and appreciated the first two films, you might as well watch this instalment to complete the set, but be warned, this is probably the least satisfying one of them all.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for imdb.

following the brilliant "goyôkiba" (aka. "hanzo the razor - sword of justice", 1972) and its excellent (and even sleazier) sequel "goyôkiba: kamisori hanzô jigoku zeme" (aka. "razor 2: the snare", 1973), this "goyôkiba: oni no hanzô yawahada koban" aka. "razor 3: who's got the gold" is the third, and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the incorruptible samurai-constable hanzo 'the razor' ittami (brilliantly played by the great shintarô katsu), who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers. as a big fan of 70s exploitation cinema made in nippon, "sword of justice" became an instant favorite of mine, and i was therefore more than eager to find the sequels, and full of anticipation when i finally stumbled over them recently. while this third "hanzo" film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cult-cinema that no lover of japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss. "who's got the gold" is a bit tamer than the two foregoing hanzo films, but it is just as brilliantly comical and crudely humorous, and immediately starts out fabulously odd: the film begins, when hanzo's two assistants see a female ghost when fishing. having always wanted to sleep with a ghost, hanzo insists that his assistants lead him to the site of the occurrence... if that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience, i don't know what is. shintaro katsu, one of my personal favorite actors, is once again brilliant in the role of hanzo, a role that seems to have been written specifically for him. katsu is hanzo, the obstinate and fearless constable, who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors, and whose unique interrogation techniques include raping female suspects. the interrogated women than immediately fall for him, due to his sexual powers and enormous penis, which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual. i will not give away more about the plot in "who's got the gold", but i can assure that it is as cool as it sounds. the supporting performances are also very good, and, as in the predecessors, there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters. this is sadly the last film in the awesomely sleazy 'hanzo' series. if they had made 20 sequels more, i would have happily watched them all! the entire hanzo series is brilliant, and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors, it is definitely a must-see for all lovers of cult-cinema! oh how i wish they had made more sequels!

shintarô katsu, best known for the zatôichi films, again stars in this third and final movie in the kenji misumi (mostly known for "lone wolf and cub), directed saga of hanzo 'the razor' itami feature the big dicked one battling ninjas, rapeing 'ghosts', and uncovering shady goings on at the shogunate treasury. the hanzo 'plot' was kinda getting stale and repetitive. what was once novel in the first film, was not any longer. fortunately, this one was better then the second thanks to having more humor. i'm just glad that they choose to stop at the one trilogy (i'm looking at you lucas) my grade: b dvd extras: merely trailers for all 3 hanzo the razor films eye candy: aoi nakajima unleashes both tits, mako midori just her left one

the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation. inoue replaces yasuzu masumura (blind beast, red angel, manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. of course, hanzo being hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. hanzo's superior officer, onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, and generally, it's business as usual.significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the finest in the hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.

this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say, "enough already!" of course, it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. eric phillips (don wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to eric to clear her name. wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me. being a pm production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator. it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995.

scanners ii: the new order is just as good as david cronenberg's classic scanners, scanners was made in 1980 and scanners ii in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies. the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing, it wouldn't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first. scanners ii: the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well. the plot to scanners ii: the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge.scanners ii: the new order is a great sequel to david cronenberg's sci-fi classic scanners and should be seen. check this out. 10/10

as b movies go, it was well above average (i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, although i am trying to minimise any such tendency). as sequels usually go, it was utterly fantastic(despite a "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. despite this sometimes tedious tendency, it seemed to work in this particular film, so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original "scanners").the movie was similar in ways to the "superman" series, in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents (who seemed modelled along the same lines as the kents in the "superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-conforming children, adolescents and/or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as "real genius", and (to a more superficial degree) "doctor mordrid" and struck a particularly strong chord.the film had a positive message, and was fun to watch. i found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even profoundly touching at times. these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex(uality, in this case, as the sexual elements were tastefully done) and violence that makes b movies (or shakespearian plays, for that matter!) so much fun to watch!this is a must watch for all comic book, sci-fi, "remote viewing" enthusiasts, and horror fans! with the right exposure in the right circles, the film could develop quite a cult following, along with the original "scanners".

as a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film. but because i've enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films, i gave it a shot.it's not bad. not great, but that's something else. the film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title character. dr. mordrid also has to deal with people, and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully.possible spoilers follow.dr. mordrid can travel between "dimensions," and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however, the guard has been blinded. his eyes are ruined pits. so the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes, and hey, presto! his eyes have been restored! this sort of healing apparently only works with eyes.later, mordred and his "brother" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. guess which one wins.however, side from that, the picture isn't at all bad, though much like a comic book. dr. mordred's more "human" adventures are okay, and combs plays the role convincingly.i've seen lots worse.

possibly the best movie ever created in the history of jeffrey combs career, and one that should be looked upon by all talent in hollywood for his versatility, charisma, and uniqueness he brings through his characters and his knowledge of acting.

this film surprised me a little. i watch a lot of horror/sci-fi films and this is a straight-to-video release that caught me off guard a little. i believe this is full moon's best movie thus far and one of jeffrey combs best performances. good movie.

two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension,one(brian thompson as a kabal)trying to destroy the earth,the other(jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid)trying to save it."doctor mordrid" is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese.the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent,but the film is very short and entertaining.so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look.my rating:7 out of 10.

new york city houses one man above all others, the possibly immortal dr. anton mordrid. mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity, using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival, kabal, chained up so that he may not enslave the human race. well, wouldn't you know it? a prophesy comes true and kabal breaks free, and begins collecting elements (including platinum and uranium) for his alchemy experiments. with the help of a police woman named sam, can mordrid defeat his evil brother? "dr. mordrid" comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection. i had not heard of it, which is a bit odd given that i'm a big fan of jeffrey combs (mordrid) and the film isn't that old. but now it's mine and i can enjoy it again and again. the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style. richard band provides the music (which doesn't differ much from all his other scores) and brian thompson plays the evil kabal. we even have animated dinosaur bones! what more do you want? of course, the cheese factor is high. i felt much of the film was a rip-off of the dr. strange comics. and the blue pantsuit was silly. and plot holes are everywhere (i could list at least five, but why bother). and why does the ancient symbol of mordrid and kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle? combs has never been a strong actor, so he fits right in with the cheese. these aren't complaints. full moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack-laced grape nuts. i'm guilty... i loved this film.if you're not a full moon fan, or a jeffrey combs fan... you may want to look elsewhere. but if you like the early 1990s style of movie-making and haircuts, you'll eat this up. stallone and schwarzenegger fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain, looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate english beyond a third grade level. i did. i wish there was a "mordrid ii", but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything (is "gingerdead man 3" really necessary?) passed on this one.

i loved this movie for two reasons: 1) jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it. plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (and is absolutely adorable.) 2) the movie helped to inspire a role-playing game i thoroughly enjoy, mage: the awakening. i've shown it at various larp after-parties, and it's always a big hit.d&d love and jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well-done and thoroughly enjoyable. the plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not too badly done, and cheesy in all the right places. a good way to spend an evening.

doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. which is why i'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of full moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em' this could have been a harry potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great - i wasn't sure if ms. nipar hadn't wandered off an a-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. no, seriously! anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license dr. strange, because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.

i really enjoyed "doctor mordrid". this is a low-budget film, which may be off-putting to some, but i have no problem with it. i admire it even more for that, considering it's way more entertaining than the drivel that hollywood churns out every year. too bad this didn't get a theatrical release; i don't know about anyone else, but i would have went to see it in theatres. `doctor mordrid' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy, especially if they're into sci-fi like i am. i don't see why this is a r-rated film; only one f-word is said, and there are no gruesome death scenes, nor is there any blood at all. the timeless rivalry between sorcerers anton and kabal (anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race, while kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself. basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch. there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: seeing jeffrey combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit. that makes me laugh every time i see it. but i digress... anyway, the acting is great; the main protagonists (anton, and his lady friend, samantha), are very likable; anton is sympathetic, and hospitable, and samantha is friendly. plus, the settings were wonderful. the floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting; we're only given a glimpse of it twice, though; it would have been great to see more scenes take place here. the main setting was also very neat; anton's apartment is very roomy, and he has some cool devices, especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world's occurrences. he even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named edgar. overall, this a great film; it was fun to watch, and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles. if you can find anywhere that rents `doctor mordrid', you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it. it was definitely money well-spent)!my rating: 8 stars out of ten.

dr. mordrid, what can i say? jeffrey combs has done it again!anton mordrid has been on earth for 100 years waiting for kabal, an evil sorcerer, to come so he can kill him. mordrid and kabal used to train together as kids, so mordrid knows all kabal's tricks.the film as a little bit confusing at begin with, but soon you feel a part of the action. i won't give away the ending, so go and watch doctor mordrid!i found the film to be very enjoyable because it doesn't have a lot of violence in, nor sexual scenes. the film focused on the plot and that's what i like! i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by. this is because you are so engrossed in the film. doctor mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie! i give it a 20 out of 10. worth seeing!

this is another great movie i had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to rick baker et al). back in the late 80's i was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three jc, sh & yb. i wasn't sure what to expect when i payed my hard earned money to see this in a "triple bill of classics" at the old scala. i need not have worried, i was left breathless by this movie. if you're a fan of hong kong action / kung fu movies and haven't seen this movie, do so now!

but this is a great martial arts film. liu chia liang ranks second to none as a fight choreographer, only sammo hung at his best compares. this is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique -rather than flashy camera angles etc. - during fights. the direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed. this film benefits also from liu's participation in front of the camera. liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history. liu is supported by the beautiful and talented hui ying hung (of my young auntie fame) and 'hsiao hou' whose acrobatics are breathtaking, and preferable to any amount of wirework as for the plot , this film follows the not uncommon theme of revenge, but with character and moral development along the way, and a most fitting resolution. the humour in this is also of the best. if you only watch one kung fu film ever, this would be a good choice- it has it all.

forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films. its influence was felt for more than a decade. however, certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit, and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help. but, the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient,extinct krell civilization and "monsters from the id" hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant "must see" movie. what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible. the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration. i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic.

this was one of those $.50 cent deals of yore---and far more complex than most realize---and it was in color! not only are the effects extraordinary, vs. crap like 'earth vs. the flying saucers'---the real 'killer' is the 'universality of plot'---everything hinges on two principles---the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous-thinking father's desire for his daughter, and the idea of what would happen should a world's tech reach the point where all citizen's desires become manifest.needless to say if everyone we wished dead gets dead, not many, if any left---and that became the fate of the 'forbidden' planet's populace---rather modern, actually. unfortunately the 'gear' of 'the krell'---wasted by ignorance, remains, and 'morpheus', the incestuous father, knows how to access such tech---and does so, to prevent losing his daughter to another. ancient plot, beautifully rendered.and considering its age, it remains a stunning suspense, action, human-emotion classic---and visually very modern---don't pass this one up---it presages all modern sci-fi---and its pscychological content elevates it, beyond any genre---a timeless work---and the soundtract! you will see/hear no pure 'synth' and perfectly syched moog background---a 'not miss'---

this has always been one of my favourite movies, and will always be. over the last few years i have become a 50's / 60's sci-fi freak, trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then. i love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were. the great colours and the sets get me going too. it's a pity when they re-make some of these good old movies; they nearly always stuff it up, - just look at the recent re-do of the day the earth stood still, it's utter garbage!! forbidden planet is one of the benchmark space films of all time, and now they're trying to re-make it too, and i shudder to think what the new one will be like! to my mind, some things, such as fantastic classic movies, should just be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories, and giving people a thrill in the process. once they add all the techno-crap that we have available now, the film just seems to be more dog-meat from the hollywood sausage factory, - nothing special at all. by the way, i notice that the astronauts' uniforms in forbidden planet were also used for "queen of outer space"! that just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then, doesn't it? hey, less money and better films, hmmm....great performances in this movie from leslie nielsen, in a serious role, and anne francis, walter pidgeon (who has always been one of my favourite actors), earl holiman, and of course robby the robot!the special effects are fantastic, and the storyline is not too far-fetched. this is a great sci-fi experience!

forbidden planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema, especially from the 1950s. there was the day the earth stood still and war of the worlds, but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from shakespeare's the tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough. it's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at (though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates), but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don't know we're channeling it.on the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard, if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the b-movies of the period. a ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before. but the only one left is dr. morbis (walter pidgeon) and his daughter, who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead. morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man, and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts, led by the skipper (leslie nielsen), can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on earth.but there's a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship, one by one, every night, even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence, which the invisible something goes through easily. meanwhile, there's some romance possibly between the skipper and alraira, and there's a more pushy vibe from the doctor: you shouldn't have come to the planet to start, and now you need to go. what happens from this is even more fascinating, just on a purely intellectual level, but forbidden planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas. while everyone may remember robbie the robot, and for good reason, perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail, animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of fantasia.the acting from pidgeon is subtle: you wouldn't expect him to be a villain, though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this, and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect. and the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent, from nielsen as a born leader to holliman providing some great comic relief as the cook (who, i should add, helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon robbie provides). and the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too), and the music, done by electronics, is beautiful in its "tones". but ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the b-movie lot. when it's meant to be funny, it's intentionally so and it works. when it's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors. and when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.an inspiration for many other sci-fi films, and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old, it's a classy and entertaining classic.

i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago! living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreamed up by the props department. all in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a 'young' man

certain elements of this film are dated, of course. an all white male crew, for instance. and like most pre-star wars science fiction, it tends to take too long admiring itself.but, still, no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did, even down to the use of the "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots, and was the inspiration for all that followed, from c3po to data.the plot line, of course, is shakespeare's "the tempest". morbius is prospero, and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers... it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.

i've now seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something about it i like!50's us sci-fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch: they were either intelligently made and/or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese. forbidden planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, colour.it also had a head start with the script - although shakespeare might not have recognised it, it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well.it's the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on 200,000 years before. along the way the plot bristles with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you're watching it, but always do. that love triangle thing...yuk! disney's cartoonery still holds up well, and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after 50 years. robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though!all in all, with all faults, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives.

i should say at the outset there are many, many things i love about 'forbidden planet' and yes, i certainly consider it a 'classic' science-fiction film for many reasons. but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion. no less an authority than leonard maltin says 'forbidden planet' "...is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre." ambitious? without a doubt. intelligent? depends on what part of the film you're talking about. it certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point. at a cost of nearly $2 million (this was 1956, remember), mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling, eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before, even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects. 'charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies, yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here. even the dreaded 'monster from the id' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people, unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8. when i see the various sets and take note of the art design, models, costumes, etc., i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz,' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects. so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless. 'forbidden planet' is wonderful to look at. the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated, matte paintings of planets and space in the background, and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth. it's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you'd ever see. the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex, where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible. but then we get to the actors, darn it. the performances are almost uniformly awful, though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor, except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble. even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance, it's lugubrious at times. a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j.j. adams, and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film. he seems to instinctively know, thirty years ahead of time, that his true forte' lay in comedy, as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines. every forced reaction, whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation, looks right out of a high school play. anne francis, also very young, fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta, whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up. (alta morbius, now there's a name for you.) unfortunately, even at this early age, anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in 'butterfield 8.' there is a good story here, buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's 'cookie,' ship's cook. (holliman turns in a horrendous performance too. i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school.) based on shakespeare's 'the tempest,' the story of a dead race, the krell, and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'forbidden planet,' and for good reason. for a few minutes here and there, you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists' conception of the krell underground complex. is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings? you'll have to decide that on your own. oh, and of course there's robby the robot, every 1950's ten-year-old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like. he's funny. in places. so, 'forbidden planet' to me is a very, very mixed bag. it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed, not least of which was 'star trek.' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again.

as did others in this forum, when "fobidden planet" was offered in 1956, i rushed to see it. this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out" all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well. this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as "flash gordon". leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at that time, but walter pigeon, marvin miller, anne francis, richard anderson, earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well. there are so many visual splendors in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes. the approach to altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of the rocket-sled, dr. morbius's house seen from without and from within, the underground complex and its wonders, the setup of the weaponry, the battle with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants. veteran cyril hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline. it can be watched again and again with pleasure--i have been doing so for nearly fifty years. until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes. still the best, many say. that says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imaginations--and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem.

shakespeare's "the tempest" is a model for this exceptional science fiction film. we look for differences. prospero and his daughter, miranda, are stranded on a mediterranean island." morbius and altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star altair. ariel is a spirit. robby the robot is a man-made servant. caliban's evil hardly approaches that of monsters of the id. shakespeare spares prospero. morbius dies when altair 4 blows up. "the tempest" is a comedy. "forbidden planet" is a tragedy. we wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the krell in some future time. anne francis is altaira. jack kelly is lieutentant farman. kelly starred with james garner in the comedy/western tv series, "maverick."

i know i should like this film, and i do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying. it's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well. i also have to say that overall, the movie leaves me cold. it's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. on the plus side the effects are great (besides the cartoon monster), as are the effects, props, costumes and of course robbie. if the robot was not in this film, i don't think it would have been as popular as it was/is. the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the "krell." as many times as i've seen this movie, the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were. based on what was being produced at that time, besides "this island earth," forbidden planet is miles above the average sci-fi movies of the time. being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. certainly a classic in its own right, flaws and all, and deservedly so.

when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show. yet, while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films, the 1950s did have some very good, if not great, science fiction films like the day the earth stood still, the incredible shrinking man, invasion of the body snatchers, war of the worlds, and the thing from another world. yet, the best of the bunch, for its literacy and production values, was undoubtedly mgm's first big foray into a level science fiction, forbidden planet, released in 1956. it was a 98 minute color film, directed by fred m. wilcox, that featured then state of the art special effects, and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume, from a screen treatment called fatal planet, by irving block and allen adler, who adapted aspects of william shakespeare's the tempest into it.the film drew raves when it was released, for its oscar nominated special effects, its all electronic music score, by louis and bebe barron (although credited as electronic tonalities, to avoid music guild fees), vivid matte paintings- inspired by chesley bonestell, and the famed monster of the id (moti), which was animated by an animator, joshua meador, on loan from the walt disney studio. even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot, in his first role in either film or television. later he would appear in the film the invisible boy- included in this dvd as a bonus, as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone, night gallery, and lost in space- with whose own robot he is often confused, and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlins.the tale is simple, but elegantly constructed, and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced 'love story' aspect in the film. in the 23rd century, the united planets cruiser c-57d- a flying saucer, led by commander j.j. adams (leslie nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days), is en route to the planet altair iv, to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon, sent to the planet twenty years earlier. after a year's journey, there they encounter the lone survivor of the party, doctor edward morbius (walter pidgeon), the prospero stand-in- a philologist, his gorgeous blond daughter altaira (anne francis)- the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt, and robby the robot, the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart. morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year, yet he was immune to it. all in all, it's a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings, and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmy's and robby's exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity. yet, it's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures, for it's played straight, thus making it even funnier. as for the main feature? forbidden planet deserves all its kudos. it's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than star wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. only such films like 2001: a space odyssey, solaris, alien and aliens, and the first two terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.it's worth knowing that, despite forbidden planet's 'happy ending', there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta, as well. after all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time. also, the film wisely only 'shows' the moti once, and never shows the krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories. watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. but, even if you don't, there's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping. that alone is timeless.

okay, so robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. and don't get me started about the poster.this is still a great movie, 40 years after it was released. i grew up watching "science fiction" on the local tv station's "science fiction/adventure theater" on sunday afternoons, so i've seen quite a few sf movies from the '50s. at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.i doubt that many sf movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.

level one, horror.when i saw this film for the first time at 10, i knew it would give me nightmares. it did. surprisingly, as i recall, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them.level two, psychoanalytic theory.later as an adult, i saw the story for what it was: what if the savage, unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest.level three, pure science fiction.the best way plausibly to realize the plot's "what if" is through the science fiction genre. this is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that passes for the genre today.after 43 years, forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films. if planning a remake, skg or lucas, watch out!

today's sci-fi thrillers are more like rambo in outer-space with monster special effects (frequently ludicrous such as sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space). though tame by today's standards, the special effects of "forbidden planet" were quite striking for their time. even today, they still hold plausibility. yet, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal. much of what was going on was left up to the imaginations of the audience. (what did the krell creatures look like?) by having much of the framework of the story never divulged or only divulged in the end, the tension and suspense held throughout the movie. the ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying. in my mind, this is still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi films ever made.

there were a lot of 50's sci-fi movies. they were big draws for the drive-in theaters. a lot of them were crappy even back then. this movie and 'the day the earth stood still' stand out, and both have aged well in their own way. from the very beginning with its eerie theremin musical score (which still sounds weird since theremins are hardly ever used) forbidden planet takes you where no man has gone before. speaking of star trek there's so much material in this film that got into star trek tos its like a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain/first mate/doctor, the mad scientist, alien beings, babe in short skirt, computer intelligence; it is all de rigeur now but this was the first of its kind. besides, it has good acting and well-done artwork which even today evokes a certain awe at the imagery. consider how the huge krell machine is successfully depicted with some real depth. i saw this as a kid (at a drive-in :0)when it was a new movie and it scared me. of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but i remember being real worried about the invisible monster. forbidden planet is a movie a sci-fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing.

first off, consider that this film is nearly fifty years old! yet, it still stands up as one of the great films of all time. i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050?the story is simple, yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. i can still recall the first time i watched this, as a kid, when the monster enters the force-field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first (and only) time. had me shivering in fear, i can tell you. looks dated today, but still more than effective enough.the scenes with the tiger show their age now. you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira, but they are only just visible.likewise, the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done.it's also amazing to see leslie nielsen (better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies) as a young, but still mature man. he was 30 when this film came out! nearly 80 now!all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come. timeless.

there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship, stuff he dare not dream about.as doctor edward morbius, pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, anne francis. they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell.the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. the machinery they left behind is still functioning.maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. the terms would change, we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek.we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey. it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one, about mortal beings trying to play god.you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot. this mechanical marvel, put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day. he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space. his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar, but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea. forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b. demille.classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.never miss this one whenever it's broadcast.

i have loved this movie all of my life. it's such an intelligent story also, with plenty of classical allusions. eg. the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon. well, in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. in fp, walter pidgeon is clearly the chimera- himself and his id monster. i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $150m on special effects, but about $1.50 on a screenplay.cheers

forbidden planet rates as landmark in science fiction, carefully staying within "hard" aspects of the genre (science -- not fantasy, ergo nerds will love it) while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary 1950s values. morbius's isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens, a swimming pool, and the ultimate home appliance: robby the robot. "a housewife's dream!" exclaims the captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robot's abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate waste.also revealing to the 1950s: fruedian psychology rears its head in the id explanation, although morbius dismisses it as an outdated concept. there is a touch of the pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the saucer. perhaps most timely is the post-atomic fear that science is the enemy, and arrogant scientists will unwittingly bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledge.yet the suburban drama presented by forbidden planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci-fi genre. they aren't swashbucklers or heroes, but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a serviceman's crudeness and honesty. the good guys drive the flying saucer, and the aliens are so long gone we don't even know what they looked like -- although their music er-"atmospheric tonalities" by bebe and louis barron are remarkably futuristic today. the views from morbius' house are truly alien with jagged cliffs and pink bonsais. the interior of the saucer is just this side of buck rogers. there's a lot visually to like. although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the kiddies, forbidden planet is a cerebral movie, slow paced and talky. it is working on many levels at once: hard sci-fi against space adventure, philosophical against domestic. there are many suburban touches. in spite of all their space-talk, the soldiers are dressed for the golf course. morbius' fatal discovery is a humble educational facility, a schoolhouse. the most interesting character is morbius' daughter altaira. having never seen a man she is unashamedly forward to the crew. she's a post-madonna teen who designs her own space-age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits -- imagine christina aguilera with a household replicator. men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a minidress, but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress. anne francis deserves better recognition for humiliating the leut with kisses. alas we'll never know if she was "working" him as he suspects, since the captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for her attention. she is the character who makes the important change in the film. shocked that her father compares the dead doc to the other "embeciles" in his landing party, she turns away from her father, her home, to leave with the sailors for earth. it's this act of defiance, of maturity, that sends morbius' id creature over the edge, allegorically destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the krell. maybe the krell had teenage daughters too...?

if you like star wars/trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times, other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. the intensity of the root material (shakespeare's "the tempest") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later lucas). and just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up. this was the first movie where you couldn't. miracle it was made at "a-movie" scale, economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it. and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was "lassie come home". until i looked him up, i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a "b" genre back then. this was either a very very visionary production, or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood.there are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively. there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; "computers", as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. star trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later. and if the trek/wars technobabble turns you off, fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today. the "ship" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done, for tv or film. we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked.if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching fp will explain all that. it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars'.

the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot. my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci-fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for. how wrong i was. big studio, big budget and big production values make this a strong contender, at least visually, for the best sci-fi film coming out of the era. i qualify with the word visually, because "war of the worlds" is a lot darker and scarier than "forbidden planet", and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory.what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography, followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr. morbius' (walter pidgeon) home and laboratory. but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake, the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold. it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say, that of "star wars". which made me consider, audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with sw, or in 1986 with "aliens". watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect, and i'm fairly resistant to hyperbole.it's not too much of a stretch to imagine "forbidden planet" as a direct antecedent of the 'star trek' tv series; gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show. followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'star trek'. i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c57-v headed for a transporter room, while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series.where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the id'. that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for 1956, when every other sci-fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures. the film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams (leslie nielsen) explained it.you know, looking at the calendar, the year 2200 isn't that far off. this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets. i think though, that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby.

a flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet.' what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.on the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. some compare it to shakespeare's tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its the tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek.anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. the special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. if it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.this is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi i like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. the clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek, lost in space, and even farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek's original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. while i do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it. some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles. unfortunately, nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). walter pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. ms francis, earl holliman, and the amazing robby the robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. the problems with the featured performances, i think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. though they certainly got most of the film quite right.

this is a film that has it all, the dashing hero, the beautiful damsel in distress, the noble figure with the tragic flaw, and a truly wonderful robot. forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn't lose its flavor with repeated viewings (although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score).movie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams, although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role. the distinguished and noble-looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret (id). other supporting cast deserve a nod, especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful "doc", and of course the charms of miss francis, as noted above.this film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, no less. the credits call them "tonalities", but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the "theremin" device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track. still, it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krell.the special effects are also quite arresting. i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible "id" monster, and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe. the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways, guided by the enigmatic dr. morbius.i recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr. morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot. the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters. viewers of follow-on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes, although i recall he never had the "personality" of the original robby.i must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves, through force of will, to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes. although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately overlooked) by dr. morbius until pointed out by the clear-thinking commander adams, who forces dr. morbius to confront the evil within himself. it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr. morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect, which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine: "here. here is where your mind was artificially enlarged. consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine. but your subconscious had been made strong enough." zowee!forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci-fi film ever, and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen.

a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some of the acting, outdated dialogue etc.first, there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, now all dead, who were 1 million years more advanced than earth humans(us), and their technology, particularly the 8,000 cubic mile machine.second, there is the music and sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. it creates an eerie, unearthly feeling, unlike "2001", which had traditional classical music.third, its "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned, it's also based on real science and doesn't break the laws of physics and biology.finally, and most importantly, forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and, more incredibly, succeeds in making an honest, intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human (or any other biological entity's) development, no matter how long we survive as a species.in other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.

sure star wars (a movie i have seen at least fifty times) beats all the others in special effects, but this film has every thing else!it has horror(non-graphical), romance, robots, witty repartee, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects, and drama.i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print, and i was amazed at how well it held up today. i thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey, but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne.ann francis in here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me.the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me.of course we all know that the "great bird of the galaxy" probably modeled much of "star trek" from this movie.no one has yet to beat robby, the robot, in terms of personality(sorry, r2d2 and c3po).this movie, overall, is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to!honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles.

i first saw this movie when it originally came out. i was about 9 yrs. old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie i had seen up until that time.basic plot: an expedition is sent out from earth to the fourth planet of altair, a great mainsequence star in constellation aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since.theme: an inferior civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remains of a greatly advanced alien civilization, the krell-200,000 years removed. the "seed" of destruction from one civilization is being passed on to another, unknowingly at first. the theme of this movie is very much good vs. evil.i first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally. i was just a boy and the tiger scenes really did scare me as did the battle scenes with the unseen creature-force. i was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie.what really captures my attention as an adult though is the truth of the movie "forbidden knowledge" and how relevant this will be when we do (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (alien) civilization far more developed than we ourselves are presently. advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand. we must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. this is, in my opinion, the great moral of the movie.i learned in graduate school that "knowledge is power" is at best, in fact, not correct! knowledge is "potential" power depending upon how it is applied (... if it is applied at all.) [it's not what you know, but how you use what you know!]the overall impact of this movie may well be realized sometime in mankind's own future. that is knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we must, must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to truly control our own destiny or we will end up like the krell in the movie-just winked-out.many thanks to those who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very much appreciated!! i hope you are as entertained by this story as much as i have been over the past 40+ years ....rating: 10 out 10 stars

i am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas. even star wars which is visually brilliant, has one of its central images, a futuristic "gang that couldn't shoot straight." imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons, most of them having an open shot, and they miss.i have read much science fiction, and wish there were more movies for the thinking person. forbidden planet, one of the earliest of the genre, is still one of the very best. the story is based on a long extinct civilization, the krell, who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps. unfortunately, what they hadn't bargained for, is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual. the primitive aspect of the brain, the id, as freud called it, is allowed to go unchecked. it is released in sleep, a bad dream come to corporeal existence. walter pigeon, dr. morbius, is the one who has jacked his brain to this level, and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind. his thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend. the krell, a much superior species, could not stop it; it destroyed them. the landing party has never been of great interest to me. the rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable. ann francis is beautiful and naive, and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male. her father's ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties' astronauts (for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts). they are always trying to figure out "dames." the cook is a great character, with his obsession for hooch. robbie the robot has much more personality than most of the crew, and one wonders if mr. spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature. the whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star. morbius can't turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him. there are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once; this is one that can coast right into the 21st century.

forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . as soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . we meet the unforgetable robbie , the mysterious dr morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - the krell who died out overnight . or did they ? you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron`s electronic music adds even more atmosphere i`m shocked this film isn`t in the top 250 imdb films .

i love this tv series so much. it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. i cant believe that they cut it off tv, and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but i'm not sure. cybersix was by far the best tv show ever. i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it. i luved it so much <3 its about a women by the name of cybersix, she is not human. she goes by adrian sieldman, a man teacher at a highschool. now cybersix is actually a women, she is just disguised as a man in the day. by night cybersix patrols the city.a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix, and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her.if u have never watched it before u should totally download it. it was the best tv show in the world. why did they cut it off???? some people have issues. but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes.

revenge is the theme of this denzel washington thriller that offers its share of action, mayhem, murder and grisly bloodletting. the essentials are a bodyguard's search and destroy mission as his charge, young dakota fanning, is kidnapped from school, which is exactly what washington was hired to prevent. the mexico city locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable, violent conclusion, with plot twists along the way. washington, a former cia operative with a drinking problem, gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot's outline. washington and fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning, the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends. christopher walken, rachel ticotin, radha mitchell, giancarlo giannini and mickey rourke comprise the good cast in support of the two stars.

basically, the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two scotts(ridley and tony). let's make it straight, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner/thriller ever made.when it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, denzel washington and tony scotts really make a perfect duo. both this movie and deja vu are better thrillers you can expect. washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie. one would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road. it's a success that they created a super-dark mexico city with a lot of shits happening. one would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in man on fire. i don't know what would the mexicans think when they watch this......well, let's face it again. it's among the best of the death wish genre, but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence. it's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let denzel washington play the "missing sheep" type of tragic hero. in the end, they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary. i was checking on imdb if the movie was based on real events for that...... so that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony.at the end, i hope one would not take this movie for real.8/10 for art direction/editing/cinematographic/denzel washington.

this film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. sorrow, love, laughter , anger. there are so many emotions thrown into this film. from start to finish this film is immensely captivating. the plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. washington as always puts on a great performance.the plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. for instant, taken is a similar film but when you compare them both, man on fire wins hands down. the characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. mexico city feels alive , it looks like mexico city, it smells like mexico city. everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something i enjoyed and brought the best out of mexico citythis is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. there enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there's washington to bring a smile to your face . watch this film, you won't be disappointed

tony scott can make good films and bad, personally i think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.what makes this film so great is that scott gives denzel (on scorching form, better than training day) and the revelation who is dakota fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. the set up is absolutely not boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for radha mitchell as the mother. this all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. this film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.the film would of course be nothing without washington. i often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (i can only really think of one, daniel day lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). this film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. it just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. i wish i'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.

man on fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom. at first he's not to friendly, but then they befriend with each other, he decides to stop drinking etc., etc... then one day she gets kidnapped... and killed...and he, won't stop at anything to get the revenge.that's basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry.that's also because of the great music harry-gregson williams with lisa gerrard (gladiator) composed.but the strongest part of the movie... wait... the thing is, everything here is perfect.first - acting. denzel washington is at his best, mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always, great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning. and that's not the end of the list...then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing, should have won an oscar for sure.the story is... not just a revenge movie. the story is intelligent, the story makes you think... and is pure beautiful. really.this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime, at least once!

in mexico city, the former cia assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man john creasy (denzel washington) is hired by the industrialist samuel ramos (marc anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend rayburn (christopher walken), to be the bodyguard of his young daughter pita (dakota fanning) and his wife lisa (radha mitchell). pita changes the behavior of the cold creasy, making him live and smile again, and he feels a great affection for her. when the girl is kidnapped and creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears to kill each one responsible for the abduction."man on fire" is almost a masterpiece, and will become certainly a classic in the future. the story is excellent, never corny and although having 146 minutes running time, the viewer does not feel time passing. the cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, highlighting denzel washington, dakota fanning and radha mitchell. the cinematography has wonderful moments, and the screenplay has stunning lines. i personally loved when the character of christopher walken explains to manzano (giancarlo giannini) that creasey's specialty is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. i agree with the user that commented that "man on fire" is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year in this genre. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "chamas da vingança" ("flames of the revenge")

i am amazed that movies like this can still be made. i watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen. never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on.washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays creasy, a washed-up ex-counter-terrorist agent who's taken to the bottle. once he's assigned to protect young pita (dakota fanning) in mexico city, his emotional and redemptive arc is jump-started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide. inevitably, pita is kidnapped by thugs, and creasy decides that most of mexico city must pay the price for daring to take away his character's teddy-bear-clutching catalyst. yes, he has become...a man on fire. you must see this movie.

it's hard to top this movie in several ways. everything works really well here; the casting, acting, script, and cinematography are all first-rate. for the moviegoer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. for the film critic, there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit. there are some tactical blunders, and as has been discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle. however, i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent's pragmatic approach, creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences. like jesus himself, creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not. in any case, i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent. in any case, this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre. an excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting, and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 (or better) film.

man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers i have ever seen. despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. this is denzel washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée, pita. dakota fanning plays pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. as i said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times.this film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed. and then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and "la hermamdad" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita.denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. it is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, washington really deserved another oscar for his performance, and so did fanning and the director. and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.if you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see. the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10

this comment does contain spoilers!!there are few actors that have an intangible to them. that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma, panache and swagger. it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great. i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson. you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good-bye to andy garcia in ocean's 11 when they just utter each other's name disdainfully. "terry." "danny." you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene. these guys just have it. you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does. if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name, you can see that there is no finer an actor working today. i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work, but he is definitely the cog of the production. i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw, emotional and incendiary all at the same time.washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives. he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led. he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man. his friend and perhaps mentor, played very reservedly by christopher walken, is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich. apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s.e.a.l.s and such can do very well while providing a needed service. creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty. marc anthony is fine as samuel, radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita. i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy. the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role, perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly. but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role.it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema. together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them. tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better. i am interested to see how his next film, domino, turns out. i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one, his name will surely be elevated to icon status.the story has creasy really taking to pita, and vis-ca versa. there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad, he is not around much. he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family. soon, creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition. he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear "creasy". it's not just a friendship between them, it is more of a kinship, and a deep parental love seems to be present. the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her. this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion. and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force. like i said earlier, i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day, but never have i seen him like this. he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead, he becomes a literal man on fire. it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance. denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation. this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind. also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance. i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily. they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die. but not in this film. writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful. the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes. there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice. he needs information and someone loses a finger. he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things. there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film.man on fire is one the five best films of 2004. now that it is out on dvd, my recommendation is to get the se. it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks. 10/10

this is an excellent, heartbreaking movie. it is by far the best i've seen that depicts the current reality in latin america...kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims. denzel washinton gives the most moving performance in his career, in my opinion. dakota fanning is an amazing young actress. the relationship between washington and fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, i believed every minute. the cast is brilliant, christopher walken, mickey rourke are great as always. walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor. i would have loved to see more of both of them. the authentic locations are remarkable. the camera work is interesting and different. there are many famous latin actors in the cast, making it all the more interesting for people familiar with latin american cinema. i highly recommend this movie.

man on fire was hot. i love a classic tale of good ol' revenge, and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl.the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy (denzel washington) and pita (dakota fanning) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita. it was also good that creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the "proper" channels, but instead used torture tactics and street smarts. some may say, "torture is wrong regardless," and you may be right, but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back, you can't help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless. there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that.creasy's quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys. but creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie, it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back. his death was noble in fact.denzel does an excellent job as do the writers. this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie.

i get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies, and they were not disappointed when i watched this one. i cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness. i ached for the family and i ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how. denzel was fabulous as always, and so was chris walkin. mickey rourke, i did not even recognized though; the years have not been kind to him. my husband is not one to re-watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies(snore!!!!) he has watched this movie 5 times now and i am going to have to get the dvd to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time i was watching.

when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it. man on fire was one of those movies. i was curious on a rental one time, and i decided to take it home with me, my precious blockbuster rental in my hands. i watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. it is like none other...drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. i got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as i could scurry out of the household and head over to best buy. i've watched it several times now. denzel washington (creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live. dakota fanning (pita) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start. they bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, la hermandad. creasy (denzel) tells the mother of dakota fanning that he will hunt down the killers, fearing that pita is dead. this is where creasy really shows the person he can become. he uses his contacts from pita's kidnapping and creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit. my favorite line of all, is in this movie, when christopher walken tells the afi agent that "a man is a work of art, in anything that he does....cooking, whatever. creasy's art is death...he's about to paint his masterpiece." he plays a very unique roll of creasy's old partner and friend. after finally pursuing the brother of "the voice," leader of la hermandad. creasy arranges a meeting to trade pita for himself and the voice's brother. in the end, creasy dies from being shot earlier, and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss. it is a very sincere and sad ending, but a great one. i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick. the story is in depth, everything is explained from beginning to end, and nothing corny at all in any way or manner.

-kidnappings in mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you're rich then you'll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe. a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita. at first, their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while, creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father/daughter relationship. one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process. when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice.-keep some tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it. i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right. the only problem is the annoying visual style, which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott. i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because i'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it's been possessed by demons. i wouldn't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it's spread through out the whole movie then that's when we have some problems. the same annoying style was recently used on "domino" and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie.-another person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry gregson williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images. somehow, williams wrote some decent music for the movie but i'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better. the sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience, it rather makes you feel like you're being punished. the overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it. i don't know why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie.-the acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals. little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart. if the end of the movie doesn't make anyone cry then they're dead on the inside. denzel washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily, for him he gets to play a great character. the whole idea of a man that's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character. i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge. radha mitchell plays marc anthony's wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i can't hate the movie too much. j.lo's husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn't really stand out much. mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact.-one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie. a little too late for that if you ask me. let's hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this.

you know you're in for something different when a movie has christopher walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, "man on fire" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.denzel washington stars as creasy, a former cia assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed. so far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the bible and not doing all that well with either. as the movie opens, mexico city has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community. creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. the first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between creasy and his charge, pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into creasy's initially hardened heart and affections. the last two-thirds of the film turns into an avenging angel melodrama, as creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.based on the novel by a.j quinnell, "man on fire," astutely written by brian helgeland and flashily directed by tony scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. it takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. these scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. even better are the quiet, intimate moments between creasy and pita in the early parts of the movie. washington and the wonderful dakota fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. in addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from walken, marc anthony, radha mitchell, mickey rourke, rachel ticotin and giancarlo giannini. but it is washington and the delightful ms. fanning who steal the show."man on fire" would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller.

although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (kill bill vol. 2; the punisher; walking tall), man on fire works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable denzel washington, one of the best actors around today.in man on fire, based on a.j. quinnell's 1980 novel (first filmed in 1987, with scott glenn), washington plays a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of jack daniels, until his old partner (christopher walken) offers him a chance at redemption. he is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (dakota fanning) of a mexican businessman (marc antony) and his american-born wife (radha mitchell). while he and fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past. it is that very bond that will force washington back into his old line of work when fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed. with almost any other stock action hero (schwarzenneger; segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before. but washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does. still, he gets help from a very intrepid mexican newspaper reporter (rachel ticotin) out to expose "la hermanidad" (the brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for fanning's abduction.man on fire is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache-inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director tony scott (top gun; crimson tide), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness oliver stone's use of montage in jfk or sam peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films). still, scott gets a very good performance from washington, as well as fanning, who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid. harry gregson-williams' south-of-the-border spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of chopin, debussy, and even linda ronstadt's classic 1977 country-rock version of "blue bayou." although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most.

there are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality that whips latin america with regard to the kidnappings thing, the police corruption at continental level, among so many realities that we live the latins. the performance of denzel wahington was brilliant, this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way. dakota fanning just by 10 years, an excellent actress has become and i congratulate her. the rest of the movie was of marvel, i have it in my collection. i hope that they are happened to those producing of hollywood to make a movie completely in venezuela, where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency, the traffic of drugs or the political problems. they have been few the movies that they play venezuelan land (for example: aracnophobia, jungle 2 jungle, dragonfly) they should make more, as well as they make in mexico.the song "una mirada" i hope that it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. my vote is 10/10

i liked this film a lot. it's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie. a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds.in the end, motivated by love or vengeance, or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is "right". 'will god ever forgive us for what we've done?' - it's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do, what he's good at, what he's been trained to do.denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supporting cast. i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.

here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough denzel washington. he's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.the story is about washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little american girl living in mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) he becomes attached to the kid, played winningly by the child actress of our day, dakota fanning. when fanning is kidnapped in front of him, washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one. beware: this film is not for the squeamish.this is stylish film-making, which is good and bad. i liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. i thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, but it's (the shaky camera) not for all tastes.besides the two stars, there is the always-interesting christopher walken, in an uncharacteristically low-key role, and a number of other fine actors.the film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works.

mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect. this film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. director scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances. i really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon, so you better go and see this one while you can. despite its relentless grimness, i think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative, and effective. scott has a tough thing to sell, but i think i'm a buyer. the extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore. scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing, and he pulls a great performance out of denzel washington. sensitive souls need to stay away from this one, but i recommended it to those viewers looking for a great, action-filled movie.

this is by far one of the better made movies and didn't leave me disappointed at all. the sound track along with finely shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . the are always chances a movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another, but i felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. dakota fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. as for mr. washington and of course christopher walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light.

i loved this movie. i'm a mexican and was in the least offended by it. in fact, i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico. it's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. it angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. we should have someone like creasy, denzel washington's character. a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's creasy did his fine job upon. that would be so marvelous (sorry, i am that resentful!). man on fire is a gripping film that you can't miss. it might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies) but the effort will be well worth it. some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like traffic, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is). the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. i swear you'll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers. his performance is nothing short of excellent. the ending (no spoilers, ok!!!) is a bit sad, but i'm sure you'll like it anyway. man on fire is one of the year's best movies. a "must own" for a dvd collection! 9* out of 10

this has to be one of the best, if not the best film i have seen for a very, very long time. had enough action to satisfy an fan, and yet the plot was very good. i really enjoyed the film,and had me hooked from start to finish.added blood and gore in there, but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film, and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think.it is a must watch for anyone. seen many reviews, slating the film, but to be fair, most the films that get bad reviews, turn out to be some of the best. this proves it once again.rent this film, buy this film, just go out and watch this film. you will not be disappointed.

i couldn't have been more thrilled; just eight years old back in 1983, i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater! the best day of my life was about to happen. to that time, my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars. i hadn't even seen the empire strikes back yet.and boy, did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. jabba. big rebel spaceships. the emporer. a green-bladed lightsaber!! wow! since that magical day, i must have watched this movie hundreds of times. i can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. with those multiple viewings, i have of course observed that this movie - the real episode iii - does have its flaws.of course in the context of a star wars movie, those "flaws" are more like "quirks".millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. in may of 1983, i had mine. and this was my star wars movie.

...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. the film is excellent, the acting by both denzel and dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. actually "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. the film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just don't miss it

certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time. exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked. a story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. the location of mexico city adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. all in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. highly recommended!

i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite. the gameplay is indeed very similar, and is very addictive. once i'd played it a couple of times, i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too.... i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie, it's brilliant. if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single-player game, simply set up a freelancer server on your own pc (easy to do and the software is included) and play to your heart's content. there are still a huge number of freelancer servers on the internet, so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening, because you don't often meant other players unless you want to. so go get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. the depth of this game is staggering, with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is nearly endless. fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay. get one with the full written manual if you can (blue box, not xplosiv red box), it's loads better!

this is a great game! okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but digital anvil have still come up with a good game. there is a certain similarity to elite(you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships, go on missions)however this game features a heavily scripted mission. it is a great mission. the control system is different it uses the mouse! you basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up! the game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003. it should run well on even a modestly specified pc. the story features some great voice acting from john rhys davies, george takei, jennifer hale(she appears in every computer game). stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on. there is even a race section, where you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course(it involves you going through rings). this section took me a while to beat. it adds variety to the game. some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game. the game has an active mod scene on the net. pick up some mods to extend the game. i haven't played any of the mods yet. sadly a sequel to this was cancelled, a shame!

this game is very addictive, i kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space contributed to this, at times i just had to play on in order not to loose any game data.so yes, "freelancer" is addictive but also quite flawed. also for instance, something that extremely bothered me was that you couldn't skip any of the cut scene's with as a result that at times you had to watch the same few minute cut scene time after time. a great opportunity for me to multitask to check my e-mail or have a chat with my friends and more things like that, while i had to wait for the cut scene to be over.the story starts of promising but the further you get the more ridiculous it all gets. also the game also ends quite abrupt, at least it did so for me. it is quite obvious that they are hinting at a upcoming sequel. i don't know if a sequel is in the works at the moment but i am sure that most likely i will pick one up once it will be released.the gameplay is very easy! even for those who are not familiar with flight games. to put it boldly, every fool can play this game. yes, some levels are quite hard and require lots of effort. it took me about 1-2 weeks for me to finish this game which might be a bit too short. but thank god for the multi-player option! it allows you to keep playing short missions, just like the single player game once you have completed it by the way.even though lot's of mission are the same, it just simply stays cool to be in the middle of the at times massive dogfights.the graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anything.addictive game but beware of its flaws.7/10

i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as were several of these. i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back, and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character(and also mark hamill, as an actor). after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks, they weren't so bad. i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and i felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. the ending (with some new additions, i presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn't already know, i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. oh, and, err -- carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.

i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished. the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor/darth sidious. he is about to be destroyed when darth vader, dark lord of the sith, eliminates his dark master. a nice sacrifice. the cinematography of this film is impressive. i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers. i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (lando's co pilot) and many more... most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- when luke sees the spirits of obi-wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker (sebastian shaw)(the greatest scene in star wars) 3- when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lord.i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader v.s luke skywalker on the death star. post-script: the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.

when i saw it for the first time i was really impressed.the director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it first.but..the main point was not conflict but..friendship!older and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life.it is amazing. every time i watch it i enjoy!of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable. thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger! amazing film!i advice everyone to see it.i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time.

this is the best movie i`ve ever seen !!! thomas beckett & richard miller -two mankinds who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madnes, one shot - one killed !!? you must kill, if you getting doubt about something, you must survive !!p.p.- i appologise of my bad / worst/ english !!!

i am curious of what rifle beckett was using in the movie, and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing. if this is loosely based on carlos hathcock's sniping, i am guessing that it is a 7mm. round. i am also curious of the rifle itself. he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle that the vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father. beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. i would like to know which rifle that is also. i know that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand. i just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it.as for mr. hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills. after his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the usmc the skills that they would need in the field. his sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the usmc. i found out his name from my friend who is a former marine. any information would be great.

as most off you might off seen star wars: return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m|might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one (live tv) when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader (real name: anakin skywalker) when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground

this was another great tom berenger movie.. but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome.. tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama! billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end! sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it.. i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick.. i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent!

this is one military drama i like a lot! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett. this marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. there you have billy zane("the phantom" and others) who plays richard miller, a former swat form d.c., works for the government and takes orders only from them. who needs a bureaucrat? i don't! when these two are paired, sparks should be flying. and how. however, beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. when the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. and when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him. who needs politics when you a pro like beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. the movie was a direct hit. watch it. rating 4 out of 5 stars.

just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt. barnes, he has done it again with thomas beckett. if i thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes, it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes. great movie, even for a girl.

zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. i don't typically go for military/war movies, but this was worth my time.it was serious, but it was also humorous. beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest. no matter what, you know that he's got your back.zane's character developed throughout the film. he wasn't just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun.the ending through me a little though. it didn't really go with the action throughout the film, but i'm glad that i saw it, nonetheless.it's worth checking out.

there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism. if you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war, take a look at this one. i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle, no-one quite sure where that shot came?and, they nicked one scene to saving private ryan, so it has to have some merit in the scene.

sunday would not be sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense combat, you turn to tom berenger (platoon).here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords. life's a bitch, so he gets a green office type (billy zane) to help on the mission.the film is in the hands of luis llosa, who stunk up anaconda. he doesn't do much better here, but berenger makes the movie worthwhile.sure, it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but is is good, tense action when the time is right.

some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. however, i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one.the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. tomas beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. however, after beccket showed his day dream of montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-hearted.millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart"(as what beccket said). what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. these two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one.

"one shot, one kill, no exceptions." a must see if you are into marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! great overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details, and more. pretty close to the real thing. but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults. this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins. the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think. its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action. sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie. tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life. the plain of dealing with all of the death. must see for sniper fans.

two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets; a slimy south american drug-lord and a prominent general.moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere, sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller, taking it's time, establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. director llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. but this film is far better than his stallone/stone travesty the specialist.billy zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger. as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture. he can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here, reprising the role twice more in direct to dvd sequels.

sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies. i remember movies about vietnam or wwii, lots of firing, everybody dies, bam bam. "sniper" takes war to a new level or refinement. the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for - the helplessness of humans in the jungle, the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller, and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger. a seemingly low-budget film makes up for every flaw with action, suspense, and thrill, because when it comes down to it, it's just one shot, one kill.

no, there is another !because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i, ii & iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, i will state the good points of "the return of the jedi" and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel. of course, i loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been overly debated elsewhere.what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - a strong ecological concern - anti-militarist positions - fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force - cute creatures - harrison ford's smile - a killer scene : near the ending, when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor. the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet. and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke, thereby risking his own life ! oh, boy !what is wrong in the prequel inmho : - the whole "human factor" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults, than about wisdom - too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen - the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot by the way, if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web (obi wen, i mean) and yoda, then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japan.the magic of star wars, imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, albeit the difficulties. "de mon âme à ton âme", (from my soul to yours), as would write bejard to the late zen master t. deshimaru.

this will be somewhat short. first, don't listen to the critics, as it is not as bad as most say it is!! sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie. while sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper. and yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie doesn't? there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger. i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine's bar scene. the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it!! also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope. and yes, the sniper motto is `one shot, one kill'. judge sniper for yourself!!

despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages, it's still worth a look as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the panamanian jungle.peruvian director luis llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in panama. the film has some good moments as beckett, the veteran marine, takes a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country. the only problem, miller, has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve.miller, the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the guerrilla warfare between the military and drug lords against the infiltrated american intelligence men, learns a valuable lesson from beckett. what looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle.tom berenger, is an actor who doesn't register much, as he proves in this movie, but in the context of the movie, he is right as a man of a few words. billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until the crucial end.for lovers of action film, "sniper" offers an 112 minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a more satisfying movie.

****spoilers**** the film "sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos "gunny" hathcock. the unassuming soft-spoken mister rogers look-alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in "nam".which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is.tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgt.thomas beckett who's at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless. since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit-man. backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country.the story of the film "sniper" is focused on sgt.beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller, billy zane, being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle. the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze, frederick miraglittoa, and colombian drug king-pin raul ochoa, carlos alveraze, who's supporting him in a planned a military take-over of the country. we see earlier in the movie sgt. beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in "sniper". for it shows step by step how sgt. beckett with the help of his spotter cpt. papich, aden young, does his job. there's also a sub-plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva, eward wiley, who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter. you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt. beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait.what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo-like ending with sgt. beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog."sniper" is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies: a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy.

i've heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull. i don't think they were watching the right movie. this isn't the prototypical action movie, thank god.this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people. in this way it works extremely well, with terrific performances from berenger and zane (who doesn't sleepwalk through the movie like he has in other roles - he actually looks like he's acting).i was disappointed with the action towards the end - a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie. but watch zane's face as he panics, alone, while berenger does the dirty work.

overall i would have to say that i liked the movie. some of the fight scenes are really good. especially the fight against leung ka-yan. one point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an asian to play a black man. i mean really. talk about bad taste. during a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. otherwise, sammo copies bruce lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 stars.

"return of the jedi" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.yes, there are ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the "empire strikes back" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at jabba's palace, a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor, luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of solo and leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moon.yes, there are slight annoyances. but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. it's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. it's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!

the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. an early sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero, bruce lee, sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting. the way he slips into bruce's style and then back to his own, more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art. throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all - comedy (some unintentional, like the fake black guy), action and some incredible fight scenes.a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time.

"one of hung's better early efforts. the humor is dead-on in parts as hung tries to imitate lee's moves and facial expressions, and also in a bit where hung pokes fun at jackie chan's drunken master. the action is also pretty good, especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end. it's not the greatest film, but pretty good for '70's kung fu, especially if you're a fan of hung and/or lee. be warned, though: most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality. there is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive.sammo hung is a rural swine-herder who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys. sammo turns on his dead-on bruce lee impersonation when fighting! this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lee's "enter the dragon", but it's not exactly that... sammo is a rural swine herder--obsessed with bruce lee--who moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small open-air restaurant. once situated at the new job, he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money. when sammo switches into fighting mode, he switches on his bruce lee impersonation, which must be seen to be believed! this film is pretty sloppy, in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists, and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy (and preposterous) makeup. but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy, it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy. highly recommended for a good mood."

this movie is not a kung fu movie. this is a comedy about kung fu. and if, before making this film, sammo hung hadn't spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker jaques tati (i.ie., e.g., esp. jour de fête), he is certainly on the same wave length.personally, i think tati's films are hilarious; but they're not to all tastes. some have told me that they loathe his work. i've never figured out why, but i think it's because the character that tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan, so unaffected by the events around him (which he is usually causing) that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him.at any rate, tati's main shtick - or at least his best known - is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities. he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios. he's a hazard in a car, but the world's no safer when he rides a bicycle. but through it all, he never loses his aplomb, which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall.in a similar fashion, the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong, utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there. this gets him into trouble in small ways, since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city - such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street, a cop stops him, only to discover that hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt, soaked during an accidental dip in the bay. what's interesting about this gag is why it is hung doesn't understand what the cop's fuss is all about - in a country town, as long as no one's looking, if you gotta go you gotta go. in other words, hung is not really urinating in the street - but he certainly would - and what's the problem officer? of course hung's obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well. he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurant-owner uncle. of course, in a bruce lee movie, the thugs would be considered trounced, and they would have learned their lesson. but in hung's hong kong, reality unfortunately prevails, and the thugs return when he's not around, to trounce his uncle.of course, hung finally triumphs in the end, just as tati always did. characters like this must always triumph (at least in comedy) because they are completely innocent, and as such, despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings, they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be. we don't really want to be bruce lee (who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the bad-guy), we, in our own innocence, really want a world where lee's heroics are possible.unfortunately, that world only exists on film."ah, but what if...?" - and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best.

this is of of sammo's great early comedy films. this isn't a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (sammo) is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size. nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. oh, the fighting. good, fast-paced scenes with high impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of sammo's kicks).the funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional. there is a jim kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out sammo), but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. come on, didn't they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978? well, i guess i've seen enough white fake-as-hell "chinese people" in old american movies too.this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan.

"enter the fat dragon" is one of the funniest martial art movies i had the opportunity to see. sammo hung portrays a chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. just like tang lung of "way of the dragon." wherever sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. luckily, sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, bruce lee. he even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way bruce lee does and also releases his screeching yell. he also uses nunchucks in a scene. it was like watching a fat bruce lee. there's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. sort of like "the game of death", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.this is one of the films i really enjoyed watching and also the very first sammo hung movies i've seen. excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs. a rare classic sammo hung film i highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10!

dear readers,the final battle between the rebellion and empire. the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance. luke skywalker, now a jedi knight, returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia, now revealed as luke's twin sister! they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star. little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star.return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. it's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by john williams. mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy. leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando. 3p0, r2, and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema's greatest villain: darth vader. ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine. the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. john williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.signed, the constant dvd collector

i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say. even though this movie did not get the best comments, this movie made my day. it got me thinking. what a false world this is.what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you. it's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. same way some people are such that they are never grateful. this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself. a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster. the surviving brother decides to take revenge. through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone.amitabh gave the performance of his life. the new actor aryan gave a good performance. the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show. her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance. chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself.a great movie by raj kumar santoshi. his movies always give some message to the audience. his movies are like novels of nanak singh (a punjabi novelist who's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message for the audience. they are entertaining as well as lesson-giving.

family is about two families who are after each other's blood.viren sahay (amitabh bachchan) is an underworld don, operates from bangkok. he has a family in india. once by mistake he kills shekhar (akshay kumar). like viren sahay, he also has a family (a brother, wife and parents). aryan (aryaman), shekhar's brother is out to take revenge of his brother's death. he kidnaps viren sahay's family for the same reason.the film has got one turning point (amitabh bachchan). second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs, expression matters more. akshay's minuscule role has also put him at par with amitabh. i didn't understand what bhumika chawala was doing in this movie.there were a few loose points in the script; like; amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot-free in the city. kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague. how can the family of such a big don doesn't have any security cover?

a movie made for contemporary audience. the masses get to see what they want to see. action, comedy, drama and of course sensuous scenes as well. this is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family. it isn't for eyes of children. i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes.if it is just entertainment you are looking for, then this movie has it all. the songs are catchy. a lavish production, i must add.however, the message of the movie is not universal. it emphasizes on the idea of karma. that is, if you do good, you will get good. and if you do evil, you will get evil. the fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. in real life, this is not always true. it is well-known that most people do not get justice in this world. while it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end, there are many who escape. and then, there are many people who do good, and yet in return they meet with a sorry end.if you don't care about the message, and all you want is an escape from worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer alright.

even though this was a disaster in the box office, it is my favorite film. it gives a powerful message of family. it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan. if you want to see the indian godfather, amitabh portrays that in this film. don't read reviews by critic, they're just ignorant. this movie has good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon na(still good movie), this is the movie.

not many reviews, hence thought i would add one.do not go by the other reviews! this was a excellent movie.rks is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie.ab and akshay given yet another example of great acting, as does bhoomika too, which was a little unexpected, but great to watch.am surprised there has not been much hype around release.or filmfare/other awards nominations, considering how good the movie was.better then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good movie.is a fairly long movie, but definitely worth it and while watching it, definitely does seem long.cant wait for rks next movie and the next ab, akshay movie they always seem to do well together... e.g. waqt.bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future.

i only wish that return of the jedi, have been directed by somebody else, i mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. besides this time our heroes look like different people: princess leia no longer fights with solo, luke looks boring, darth vader is not as evil as before, and yoda just dies.but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence. 3-the emperor (now that's evil) 4- the speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-the last battle. 6-the dark side seduction scene. 7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force. 8- and the last celebration.some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. if some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.

well, i get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don't reflect my experience at all. to me, amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. he was a die-hard villain, a no-apologies villain. to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way.the kid who played aryan was probably over his head with this cast. there i think maybe the director could have done better. but, to be honest, the very best part of this movie was shernaz patel. she is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly as she played virendra sahi's wife. she may be given little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. i'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.so if you are in a habit for settling for bollywood average, you won't get much out of this movie. but if you constantly search for something more, then this might give you some of what you've been missing.

a very good movie. a classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything. this movie offers a greater number of aliens. we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces. the emperor is somewhat an original character. i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese. (excellent references) i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga. in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls. i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi-wan. it gives a sadness and a tear. the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie: when vader turns on the emperor. luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi-wan, yoda and...his father (1997 version not hayden christenssen). the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia. there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. i felt there was much more than meets the eye. and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe.

this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies. the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious. he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of bantha, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off. adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo, who was frozen alive at the end of episode v, jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside.but all of the star wars "good guys", especially r2-d2, had other ideas...and those other ideas fended off luke's execution; in the end, most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death.like in episode iv, the death star in episode vi makes its appearance. as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star, the star destroyer personnel, i guessed, sped up the arming of the main laser, using the imperial fighters as a diversion. the 20-25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise. once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out. and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience.like in episode v, the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the ewoks...but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. for instance, chewbacca, as well as another ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre, like, for instance, the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike, and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike. or, in a climax, using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader.you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown, complete with a short display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (e.g., storm trooper masks), and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis---darth vader, now dead, is burned on a pyre. the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer john williams.on the home movie version, i think lucas himself wanted a different ending. in addition to the celebration on endor, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith. the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.

when i think of return of the jedi i think epic. yeah ewoks were in there so what? they're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies. emperor palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid) was one the best parts of the movie. palpatine is so evil and vicious, vader looks like mr. rogers compared to him . speaking of darth vader, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out. his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you. the best part was of course the special effects. it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics. the scenes at jabba's palace (leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at. in all jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.

i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia, the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister darth vadar. in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time.when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. vadar it seemed had won the day. how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul.old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself ( played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud.how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar.all in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold. his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good. lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks ( who i really do not believe take from the movie at all. in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star) and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers. we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all. and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back.but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar. for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings. vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke. never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on vadar's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke. there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible. he is conflicted. the apprentice as much as the master. the victim as much as the villain. without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.so in conclusion what can i say. george lucas is the master of the saga. star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it. return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves. it's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of.

after ''empire strikes back'' ''return of the jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the star wars series.luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba. at the same time, the galactic empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous death star. if this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the rebel alliance. both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.r2 and c3po are inside jabba's palace to send a message from luke to jabba,where lukes pretends to negotiate han's life. he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan. jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(han still is frozen in carbonite) lando is hidden as jabba's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter. when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise. the problem is that jabba discovers leia's plan and takes her as his slave,while han is thrown away in chewbacca's cell.luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends. at his first try to kill jabba,he falls into jabba's monster cell (bantha),but easily kills it. jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han,chewbacca and luke to sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'. luke,han and chewie has success in scape again, and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc's mouth. leia kills jabba and goes after han,luke and chewie as well c3po and r2. everybody's safe again,luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi,as well his promise to yoda. the problem is that yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, yoda says to luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a jedi, he must fight with vader again. he confirms to luke that vader is luke's dad, and that there is another skywalker besides luke. in his last moments, yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people. when yoda dies,obi wan's spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke's father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia, and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies. he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader, the emperor will win the war.at the same time, the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up, since luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side.now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station, the '' death star 2'', luke will confront vader and the emperor, and leia, han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field, with the help of the ewoks. (little creatures who looks little bears)this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!

thanks to kevin smith, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch. and oh no! muppets are involved! that makes it bad! everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it. now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it. this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it. this movie is good fun! it's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six! enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith's opinions! his aren't correct!and that ewok song at the end ruled! i bet you people don't even enjoy "ewoks: battle for endor"!!!! i'm going to set you all on fire!

this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. however it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. it's still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.one problem here is the look of the film, which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films. i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz. the first 2 films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. in "jedi" on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. this makes for a much less textured film. also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. at this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.another aspect is its lack of originality. where "star wars" created a whole new experience in cinema and "empire" brought us to alien worlds of swamps, ice, and clouds, "jedi" lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. first we are back on the desert planet tatooine, and then we are watching them face another death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new... but you'd think lucas or kasdan could). also we have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of "star wars" if they hadn't run out of cash. it just feels like lazy construction.the most unfortunate aspect of "jedi" for me is the weak handling of the han solo character. whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke -- as if the conclusion of "empire" where she confessed her love of him had never happened. the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. ford, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. this is more like a 1990s ford performance, bored and looking "above" the film itself. fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes. lando, an interesting character introduced in "empire", here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. only hamill, given an interesting development in the luke character, is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor. the film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).visually and in terms of effects work, other than the "clean" look of everything it's hard to find fault. jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed. the space battles towards the end are very impressive.ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. but on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas' later productions.

first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427. what i know is this: star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. star wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.how, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. episode vi does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's darth vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about anakin, not just luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.star wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.

i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies. i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted. to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie.it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. i have heard many strange reasons such as: a) because yoda died b) because bobba fett died c) because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) because darth vader was revealedi would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely. first off, who cares if bobba fett died??? if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. don't get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be. his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett's name!!! judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think... secondly, many fans did not like yoda dying. sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. all the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon. another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda's death.. well, nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope. (many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy) why was obi wan's death okay but yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. that is utterly ridiculous!! i can not believe this one!! first off, the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) they had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. the only thing they had was their blasters. to add, it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo, chewbacca, and the princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! and not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters. the troopers must have very, very bad aim then! at least in empire strikes back, the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. don't believe me? check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando's base. or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star.the last reason that i care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like darth vader being revealed! well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father, annakin skywalker. it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. by annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was annakin skywalker (by removing the helmet). the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. in fact, that's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke's father...isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?on another note, i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves. i never go into a film with that deception in mind, i always try to go into a film with the attitude that "well, it might be better or worse that the original .. but i can not know for sure.. let's see." that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.i am not sure who criticizes these movies but, i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite) that it is rotj. i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.bottom line, the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy. this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. for example, the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day!!!finally, i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as "just another sequel") to trash the movie such as "this movie stinks because luke is not in it!" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately.

return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga. with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.the opening sequence, set on tatooine, we see jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to han solo, as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with luke's jedi powers, they have the edge.we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. han, leia and chewy battle it out on endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star. the rebel fleet led by lando, battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and luke has a final showdown with darth vader. an epic end to a classic saga, and it's only just of the pace of the first two.10/10

despite the feelings of most "star wars" fans, in my opinion "return of the jedi" is the greatest cinematic film ever created. ever since the first time i saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the "star wars" saga in "jedi".film summary (contains spoilers for those who have not seen it)after "the empire strikes back" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in "return of the jedi". darth vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee it's construction. the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side. luke, lando, leia, chewie, and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord; jabba the hutt. after han has been rescued, and jabba defeated, luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth; darth vader is in fact his father. the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet. now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed. while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon, the rebel heroes must disable the death star's shield generator on the forest moon of endor. it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty ewoks. during the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side. in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions. as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine, vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life. filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, "return of the jedi" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us.

main theme in this dirty harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold. sandra locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful. locke is an "8" normally, but, with a deadly pistol in her purse, "cocked" for the bad guys, she climbs all the way up the scale to a "10". having been gang-raped, along with her younger sister, some years ago, locke, as jennifer spencer, has tried to block out the attack from her life, as best she can. her sister, tho, is almost comatose as a result of the trauma, so the memory is never far from her mind. one day, jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in s.f.; she buys a pistol, follows him to a bar, lets him pick her up, then when they're alone in his cadillac, beginning to make love, she shoots him....once in the genitals, once in the brain - - this in the opening scene!! ya gotta love this spunky lady. she's got her priorities straight. plus, jennifer is a professional artist, putting all her anger on canvas until now. after executing her first perp, jennifer curiously watches det. insp. harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy. then, she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street, visits her sister in a nursing home, then goes a'hunting in san paolo, ca "up the coast" where the rape event took place years ago. with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind, our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall, as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist. not uncommon to us right- wingers, when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal, don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity, we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted. such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals, once in the brain. throughout the movie, scenes of jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good, il' dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop, remember "go ahead. make my day."? later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid (who'd just insulted callahan) in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog- s**t....leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say "i want to have your baby." my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action, when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel. michael grazzo (pantangeli in godfather ii) does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don, even if he's only in one scene, dying in a most-convincing manner. however, harry's troubles aren't over with yet! the elevator punk's gang and threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close-ordered scenes, and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly. yup, some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence....looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie. but, there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets. the punk kids die much more creatively, though, as they both burn to death and drown in s.f. bay. warms my heart. with so much violent intent directed at insp. callahan, his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the "22 caliber vasectomy killing" as jennifer spencer's crime is now known, but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals. love that harry. while our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo, two more murders happen, same m.o., on a sleazy, lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur. then harry meets jennifer! they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order, making the guilty pay, etc. could a hot, love scene be in the offing soon? we're led to believe just that. characters abound in this real-man meets real-woman crime drama, and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named raye parkins who's both irritating and entertaining. raye set up jennifer's rape for her "boyfriend" years before, and she'll get hers eventually. the san paolo police chief, played by reliable eastwood co-star pat hingle (the hanging judge in 'hang em high'), is strangely at odds with callahan's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies, until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists. much like jennifer's sister, chief janning's son is now a comatose adult, but driven mad by guilt. it can't end here, though. the dyke's rapist boyfriend, mick, now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal, drives in from vegas becuz raye's dropped a dime on jennifer, summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions. mick sleeps at raye's house, but his timing is all wrong, and he's arrested before he can spend more time with raye, mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer's revolver. psycho mick makes bail at long last, with jennifer gunning for him. a desperate chase ensues, as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other. it all turns out well in the end, with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song.

despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best dirty harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early '80's. it's also a kickass action movie.opening with a liberal, female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous, "go ahead, make my day" line), "sudden impact" is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. it gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the '80's.

sudden impact is the best of the five dirty harry movies. they don't come any leaner and meaner than this as harry romps through a series of violent clashes, with the bad guys getting their just desserts. which is just the way i like it. great story too and ably directed by clint himself. excellent entertainment.

i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie. its got a pretty good plot, some good action, and the change of location for harry does not hurt either. sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that. eastwood is in good form as dirty harry, and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop. if you liked dirty harry, then you should see this one, its a lot better than the dead pool. 4/5

****excellent***good**fair*poor`go ahead, make my day!' the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself (who was rumored of directing most of magnum force) and he brings back the violent society from the first two films. however, the film still lacks impact and believability. this film was released in the early `80s, the time of regan and the young republicans. the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame. this plot would have been better for the enforcer, which actually would have made it a good movie. what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle. rating: 3 stars

dirty harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them. probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has...anyway..... an action-packed story set again in san francisco and santa cruz. the chief rapist, played by andy drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end (of course!). not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original dirty harry.

after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer(1976) to be the final chapter in the series. dirty harry is back, older, more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic.dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer, vigilante cops, and vietnam veteran terrorists. but now he's after a new killer, a killer who wants payback, by gunning down her attackers.sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry. callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman(played by sondra locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who is left traumitized. ten years after, she's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers. at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack, of which the mob are hunting him as well. so in order to let the heat die down within the city, harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town, but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well, while hunting her attackers one by one. harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar, as he homes in on the killer's trails.sudden impact in my opinion, has to be one of my top 10 revenge films, as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet, far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined. sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had, a dark tone with entertaining value.so do you feel lucky, punk?

this final entry in george lucas's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. however, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. on the contrary. sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.the first third of the movie, where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt, is a classic. jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster. it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.things get a little bit slower around the second act, where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks. most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. i don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. however, their leader, wicket (played by warrick davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.by the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops, lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire's all-new half-completed death star, and luke's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor. the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance. also, as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid. the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. of course, given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. the acting is classic star wars fare; hamill, harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c-3po. frank oz's yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. and yes, there's also john williams' music.all told, while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.in 1997, george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored (and revamped) "special editions", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. of the three, return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans. perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) "jedi rocks" musical number in jabba's palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. however, i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on naboo, where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming, "wesa free!"), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes. probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii: attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. however, if you're watching the star wars saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the "definitive" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga (as lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. the original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.

clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this, but this one does not embarrass him. dirty harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance, there is no reason why you won't like him. he is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thinking, is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care.from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts, the character of the lead role always captivates the audience. in white hunter black heart, he is the crazy director, in "in the line of fire" he is the "old 'un" while here is the "almost" jobless with his job, that is to say he makes work for himself, doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation.based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all the "no non-sense" movie watchers. the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot. however, what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not, as it is far too obvious from the beginning. it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving. also, there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry.

sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director. the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film. one might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution. for me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. however, in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. forget the "go ahead punk, make my day scene", that's iconic but not original. but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director. and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. also, i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed. although eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see play misty for me, breezy etc.) thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.

this was without a doubt the best of the "dirty harry" series. from the opening credits, you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing. sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show harry at his bad-assed best. loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks. this is the one dirty harry flick that's raw and devoid of any "fluff". i can watch this again and again (okay, not in one sitting) because it's a gratifying "out for revenge" yarn. the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable. "go ahead - make my day...you feel lucky, punk? ...." classic eastwood as only eastwood, with his anguished, rubbery expressions, and whispery, menacing voice can do it.

when this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline "dirty harry is at it again". whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it's complete and total accuracy. "sudden impact" retains all the aspects that made the previous three dirty harry movies so successful- tight pacing, a compelling plot, strong supporting characters, endless gunplay, and bone-dry humor. some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest, bloodiest, and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise.the plot is somewhat intriguing: after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums, inspector callahan is sent on a forced "vacation" by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of san paolo. he is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his (no doubt considerable) misery by a second shot to the head. early on in the film, the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named jennifer spencer (sondra locke) who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier. this incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback, snippets of which recur before each new murder. as more bodies start to appear with the same m.o, it becomes clear to harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest (guess who?) know more than they are telling. to make matters even more complicated, the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard."sudden impact" offers relentless action from beginning to end. clint eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax. sondra locke's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character. that having been said, it is fair to wonder if another actress (who was not eastwood's off-screen companion at the time) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- theresa russell and cybill shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates. members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include albert popwell as harry's partner horace, paul drake as the psychopathic mick, and the truly scene-stealing audrie j. neenan who portrays the vicious ray parkins. however the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots (the animosity between harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums, a mob vendetta against him) take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story. their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels. in the first half of the film it sometimes appears that dirty harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom. however the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between callahan, spencer, and her former tormentors assumes prominence. this second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given "sudden impact" the potential to be a first-class, neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough .44 magnum heroics to satisfy the harry loyalists. instead we get the film that eastwood and warner bros. clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it's intended audience. this was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why. though not the film that it could have been, this is still big, trigger-happy fun. even after repeated viewings, it's going to make your day.

sudden impact was overall better than the enforcer in my opinion. it was building up to be a great movie, but then i saw the villain(s) and was disappointed.sudden impact was different than the previous installments. the plot went a different direction in this movie, as dirty harry doesn't take as much of a police approach this time around. we also don't see the villain(s) until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for us all.clint eastwood once again steals the show as dirty harry, enough said. pat hingle was enjoyable as chief jannings, harry's new assigned boss. bradford dillman seemed to change his name to captain briggs here, either way, he wasn't any different. michael currie is decent as lt. donnelly, harry's annoying superior. i personally enjoyed kevyn major howard as hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against harry. albert popwell was excellent as horace, harry's buddy. audrie j. neenan was good as ray parkins, a famous lesbian around town. jack thibeau was well cast as kruger, a pervert. now for the really bad part. sandra locke, eastwood's long-time lover was horribly miscast as jennifer spencer, harry's love interest. and paul drake was just horrible as mick.the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts.8/10.

in don siegel's 1971 masterpiece "dirty harry", clint eastwood epitomized the super-tough, super-cool unorthodox, no-nonsense cinema-cop with his role of the eponymous inspector 'dirty' harry callahan. two sequels followed, the first of which, "magnum force", tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences. the second sequel, "the enforcer" was grittier again, and was promoted as "the dirtiest harry of them all". this title, however, truly belongs to the fourth film in the series, clint eastwood's own "sudden impact", which is doubtlessly the grittiest, nastiest, most violent and downright dirtiest of all harry films, and, in my humble opinion, the second-best after the masterpiece original.***warning! spoilers ahead!*** in a small town near san francisco, a mysterious sexy lady (sondra locke) lures men into being alone with her. what these men don't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim, longing for bloody revenge. as fate wants it, san francisco's toughest cop, inspector dirty harry callahan, who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors, spends his leisure time in this exact little town... "sudden impact" is the dirtiest callahan film in several aspects. the film is extremely gritty and graphically violent. harry callahan himself is dirtier than ever. not afraid to make use of his 44. magnum in order to stop trouble, harry treats 'punks' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge-murders are justified in his opinion. clint eastwood is, as always, brilliant in the role of harry callahan. eastwood epitomized coolness and bad-assery as the "man with no name" in sergio leone's dollar trilogy, and he did so again in the dirty harry films. "sudden impact" gives us the dirtiest harry we have ever seen. eastwood's real-life girlfriend sondra locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty. the great pat hingle, who had already worked with eastwood in ted post's tough-minded western "hang 'em high" in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town. the film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters, including a pathetic criminal played by kevin major howard (best known for his role in stanley kubrick's "full metal jacket") and a woman named ray perkins (audrie j. neenan), doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema. albert popwell, who played the bank robber in the famous "do you feel lucky?" scene in "dirty harry" and the black militant leader in "the enforcer" is also part of this one again, this time as harry's colleague and buddy. overall "sudden impact" is the grittiest, dirtiest and probably the most violent of all "dirty harry" films, (though "the dead pool" isn't exactly tame either), and my second-favorite after the brilliant 1971 original. an absolute must-see for callahan fans, and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad-assery. my rating: 8.5/10

clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series. clint is older but he's still got it, harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where the memorable "make my day" catchphrase comes from!) but the city he took a vacation was worse, a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one. the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie! an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. clint eastwood's sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator. worth a watch if you like clint eastwood, the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers.

sudden impact is a two pronged story. harry is targeted by the mob who want to kill him and harry is very glad to return the favour and show them how it's done. this little war puts harry on suspension which he doesn't care about but he goes away on a little vacation. now the second part of the story. someone is killing some punks and harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet. the police chief is not a subtle man and he warns harry to not get involved or cause any trouble. this is harry callahan trouble follows him. the mob tracks him to this town and hell opens up as harry goes to war. meanwhile the vigilante strikes again and the gang having figured it out is ready for her. jennifer spencer is caught and harry comes to her rescue during the film's climax. sudden impact is not the greatest dirty harry but at the time it gives us a harry that is very much an anti hero ready to go to war just to pursue justice. again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line. go ahead make your day.

i liked nearly all the movies in the dirty harry series with the exception of the one i think is titled "enforcer". "deadpool" was a bit weak in areas too, but i still enjoyed it. this one is one of my favorites of the series, if nothing else for the great line of "go ahead, make my day". this one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong. just think "magnum force" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park. it also features dirty harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up sandra locke in a rather humorous scene. the only question that remains is why clint eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress sandra locke in so many of his movies. she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me. granted she is not to bad here, but her character could have been so much better by someone else. another problem with this movie and other dirty harry movies, at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns. i like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds? still, very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies.

clint eastwood would star again as the battle-weary detective harry callahan, but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'dirty harry' series. 'sudden impact' again like the other additions, brings its own distinguishable style and tone, but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments (and bestowing a classic line "go ahead. make my day") but some of its humor has to been seen to believe. a bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts. oh yeah. however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco.the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes. after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood. he's ordered to take leave, but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town san paulo, where a murder has occurred similar in vein (bullet to groin and between eyes) to his case. there he begins to dig up dirt, which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge.to be honest, i wasn't all that crash hot on eastwood's take, but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'magnum force'. this well-assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon (even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time), quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging. it's like he's experimenting with noir-thriller touches with character-driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework. his use of images is lasting, due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics. dark tones, brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure (harry with his new .44 automag handgun) moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks. it's a striking sight that builds fear! mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor. it seemed to come off. a major plus with these films are the dialogues, while i wouldn't call 'sudden impact' first-rate, it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines "you're a legend in your own mind". don't you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip, before pulling out his piece. the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages. lalo schfrin would return as composer (after 'the enforcer" had jerry fielding scoring) bringing a methodical funky kick, which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get-go. bruce surtees (an eastwood regular) gets the job behind the camera (where he did a piecing job with 'dirty harry') and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes, but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments.eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch, going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan. this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry's quest for justice by the badge even though he doesn't always agree with it. i just found it odd a real change of heart. across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time sondra locke. her turn of traumatic torment (being senselessly raped along with her younger sister), is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity. when the anger is released, it's tactically accurate in its outcome. paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and audrie j. neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big-mouthed performance. these people are truly an ugly bunch of saps. pat hingle is sturdy as the chief of the small coastal town. in smaller parts are bradford dillman and the agreeably potent albert popwell (a regular in the series 1-4, but under different characters). how can you forget him in 'dirty harry' yes he is bank robber that's at the end of the trademark quote "do i feel lucky? well, do ya, punk?"

after "star wars: a new hope" redefined science fiction, and "the empire strikes back" redefined "star wars", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the emperor. when the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including han solo, chewbacca, and leia), the battle raging on in space (including lando), and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star, which leads up to another duel with darth vader. it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of "the empire strikes back", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. with the light tone of "a new hope" and the more sinnister tone of "the empire strikes back", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. the special edition for "return of the jedi" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter, but other than that it was good. the gaping non-threatening sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. also, the disco was taken out of jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. it's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. a third must-see for film fans.

clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante (sondra locke)who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk, not that i'm complaining. sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment.

having never seen the original dirty harry, i judged this movie on a clean slate. and i must say, i quite enjoyed it. sure, some of the acting by sondre locke made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was the 80's. but even if you can't get past her (and i almost couldn't) or her revenge killings (which seemed a little.. overdone ;p), it's worth it just for dirty harry. or at the very least, the bull dog he affectionately names 'meathead' :p7/10.

director/star clint eastwood's "sudden impact" is an intriguing addition to the "dirty harry" series - a combination of crude film-making and genius. it's mediocre and silly in parts, brilliant and classic in others, with compelling, gripping pacing. there are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up "make my day" scene recalls the "do you feel lucky" one, one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's scorpio, an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry's partner - just to name a few.harry callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department, still mean, still tough, but now he's older and wearier. his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice, the two things not always being compatible. this "incompatibility" is the underlying theme of the series. the first film posed a simple question, "what about the victim's rights?" - (do they outweigh those of the criminal? vice versa? depends?). that film's answer was controversial, prompting a sequel (the highly enjoyable "magnum force") which set out to draw the line between harry's brand of justice and pure, heartless vigilantism. dirty harry, like many of clint's other roles, is the personification of vengeance, the protector of the the defenseless. this movie however brings it back to the victim, in this case jennifer (portrayed by sondra locke), who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men (and one woman) who committed the crime.without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie, i will say this - i mentioned earlier that "sudden impact" echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series (the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example - an intentional prank, i believe). the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante? and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights? the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series, one which i personally (as a fan) found quite moving. that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the "dirty harry" collection, the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film. (not to knock "the dead pool" - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan, rather than a character-defining film like this one).this movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing, and the president himself frequently quoted "go ahead, make my day."

anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying. there weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society. the popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby, lily-livered, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of "political correctness". the performances across the board were compelling. i sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. in particular, i found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films i've seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. the lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that dirty harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end. this was the only sequel in the dirty harry saga that equaled the first.

inspector "dirty" harry callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco. however, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary "go ahead, make my day" line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. very badass and it just what fans can expect from him. however, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. the problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as harry is. this really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, magnum force.on the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. however, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different, it is a good movie for fans. --- 7/10rated r for violence and a rape scene

it's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly (if only in comparison to other films in its legacy), and others in a 'sub-plot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong. sudden impact is one of those cases, where clint eastwood as star/producer/director shows when he can be at his best, or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime/mystery/detective story in his dirty harry fame. we get that 'make my day' line, and un-like in the first film where his 'do i feel lucky' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails, here it's switched around. he gets into another shamble with the department, as usual, when he tries to fight crime 'his' way, in particular with a diner robbery (inspiration for pulp fiction?) and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus. he's told to 'take a vacation', and that's the last thing on his mind. this whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines, which just adds to the frustration. but soon his story merges with the sub-plot that eastwood develops from the start.enter sandra locke's character, jennifer spencer, whom we soon learn after some (appropriately) mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel, unjust sexual assault (err, outright rape), and is sleekly, undercover-like, getting revenge. her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film, the most intense, and finally when it goes into callahan's storyline (he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder), the film finally finds a focus between eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs. evil (though sometimes blurred, to be sure). eastwood films the flashbacks, not to say too much about them, expertly, in a fresh, experimental style; the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others. it almost seems like a couple of times an art-house sensibility has crept into eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style, which helps make the film watchable.it's a shame, though, that in the end it goes more for the expectable (or maybe not expectable) points, and until the third act callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual 'it's smith...wesson...and me' shtick. however, with locke he gets out of her a very good performance (more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet) and an exciting climax at an amusement park. in a way i do and don't agree with ebert's remark that it's like a 'music video' in eastwood's style here. i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both, the directness, but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video. it's cheesy, it's hard-edged, it's not up to par with the first two 'harry' pictures, but hey, there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the .44.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** after two so-so outings ("magnum force" and "the enforcer"), dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in "sudden impact," a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of clint eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes.for once, the case takes harry outside his native san francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask questions later" tactics), to the hamlet of san paulo. there, (warning: potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered, one at a time, by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack.the killer is portrayed by sondra locke, and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. locke's cold eyes and frosty voice, when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit.the rapists are a despicable lot, especially the leader, who has "psycho nutjob" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate. the flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are nightmarish enough, and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants.some will dismiss "sudden impact" as trash: a mindless, manipulative revenge tale. on a certain level this is true, but it's well-done trash. what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. what we have here is an action movie with a point of view.you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry (a realization that, wisely, is not spelled out with dialogue), he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate. this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare.the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction. this is, after all, a dirty harry movie, and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. the movie is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff. some of the best "harry moments" in the entire series are here, including harry's best-known line, "go ahead -- make my day.""sudden impact" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. it is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told. and it is certainly never dull. on those criteria, it succeeds tremendously.

with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars, but produces and directs as well, you know it's got to be good. although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series, i completely disagree. in my opinion, apart from the original dirty harry, sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series. although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences, it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do. this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good, and it's got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good. in diry harry it's "..well do ya, punk?"; in magnum force "a man's got to know his limitations" ; and in this it's "go ahead. make my day." also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery, as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series. with great acting by clint eastwood and co-star sandra locke, and good directing by clint, this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever.

with harry callahan getting up in years, the inevitable `old man with a chip on his shoulder' story had to come into play eventually. callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, his demeanor still was unwavering. thankfully, this film took some time off to develop a different type of story, one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre. while the film fell short in doing so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music.

the dirty harry series began with very gritty cop action, and was almost immediately lightened up for "magnum force". by the time that "the enforcer" rolled around, dirty harry was little more than a television cop show (saved only by tyne daly). after a break of seven years, dirty harry has finally gone back to his roots. maybe he's been gone for too long this time.clint eastwood makes the first well-directed harry film since don siegel made the first, which helps considerably. harry is a darker character once again, not the nice cop he had become. he can once again say things like "go ahead, make my day" and really mean it. "sudden impact" is a true dirty harry sequel. "the enforcer" should never have been made.7.2 out of 10

the last film in lucas' saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but i think it is a notch above episode iv (and just a notch below episodes iii and v). in fact, i think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga. as far as i'm concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. it is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to lucas' universe. there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. also, it is a lot of fun. new characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. c3po and r2d2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and luke is still a great character to identify with. again, it is luke's (and vader's) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone. lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii, viii and ix, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga. not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style.

the fourth in the "dirty harry" series, this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikable, profane, disgusting females i have ever seen on film: "ray perkins," played by audrie neenan. she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 "detour" character, "ann savage."her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up....and least some of her! then i could enjoy the rest of the movie.everywhere "harry callahan" (clint eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows.....within minutes! it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving, entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one.this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts.....and connects, sad to say. most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end, and who does it better than dirty harry?

sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next. thus, sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan. this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation. harry's always on the job it seems. clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80's, sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that characterizes the first three films. this doesn't mean that it's quality is any less. bottom line: brimming with intensity and action, sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series.

the vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts. it is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan (as played by clint eastwood) so popular. he carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing. but it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen. and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `sudden impact,' directed by and starring eastwood, so successful. in this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception: whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.in his own inimitable way, inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time. so he does; as only `dirty harry' can. in a small town north of san francisco, harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m.o. employed by the perpetrator. unaccountably, harry encounters resistance from the local police chief, jannings (pat hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere. not one to be deterred, however, harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, jennifer spencer (sondra locke). gradually, harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture?eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `dirty harry.' it had been seven years since the last `harry' offering (`the enforcer,' 1976), but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor. and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4. as with all the films he directs, eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end. the screenplay, by joseph stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `dirty harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by charles b. pierce and earl e. smith) is the most engaging since the original `dirty harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action. the characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of harry's best catch-phrases: `go, ahead-- make my day...'as harry, clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular: he lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today. harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before. no matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry, or at least have him around. `dirty harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, eastwood `is' dirty harry, without question, just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone, sherlock holmes.sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.' she manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre. even amid the violence, locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life. her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwood's harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.in supporting roles, two performances stand out: paul drake, as mick, creates the best `psycho' since andy robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `dirty harry.' with actually very limited screen time, drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience. this is the guy you can't wait to see harry take care of in the end. also effective is audrie j. neenan, who makes her character, ray parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city. it's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.the supporting cast includes albert popwell (horace), mark kevloun (bennett) and nancy parsons (mrs. kruger). with a perfect blend of drama and action, `sudden impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience. 9/10.

up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. the varied action scenes and really different characters (jabba the hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.none of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth vader.another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford. finally, everyone was on the same page! it was nice to see.in the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.

when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective. the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor. it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padmé and the love she felt for her children. actually while the new films (especially episode ii) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. they make the old films seem even better.mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real. in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. harrison ford is still good. however, you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. he adds more comedy (obviously inspired from raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. in short han solo is better than ever. carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very, very good.in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always lucas' forté so that is really to be expected. the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax. the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks. these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. also george lucas' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.8/10

a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....there was a boy who was only two years old when the original "star wars" film was released. he doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. he does remember the first "star wars" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. but years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, anakin skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a northern illinois university thing).i can't review "star wars" as a movie. it represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. there's no separating it in my mind from christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. in the winter, my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth (i was always han solo). my friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the ewok village. they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda's home. i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to "star wars" and i think people either just understand that or they don't. i don't get the appeal of "lord of the rings" or "star trek" but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas's films.i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. every time i put them in the dvd player, i feel like i'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker.grade (for the entire trilogy): a+

i'm sick of people whining about ewoks! true, they're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars, but they did happen, so deal with it! besides, they are cute, and i don't care if they're marketable. yubb nubb!this movie always leaves me in tears. it's perfect. the end could not be better. i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin. i love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. so those of you who are complaining that vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. it's very effective. vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. he is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.i don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope. they all do so well. they are believable characters. hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. fisher does a fine job being a female role model (i mean, come on! she killed jabba even when so many others had failed!). harrison ford - need i say more?the music is once again brilliant. it's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. the best climax is when luke shouts "nooo!" and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle. john williams is nothing short of a genius! what an amazing man!already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i. i can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (can i wait???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.bravo!

perspective is a good thing. since the release of "star wars episode i: the phantom menace", claims and counter-claims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies. what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films. this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: "return of the jedi". often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect "the empire strikes back". indeed the 'cute' element of rotj, namely the ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities? only he can answer that question.this cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga. following on from the conclusion of "the empire strikes back", luke skywalker (mark hamill) follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine, his home planet, to rescue han solo (harrison ford), the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts.skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi (alec guiness) to fight the evil empire. now swathed all in black, luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn. his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side.early scenes in tatooine are impressive, from jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete.when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime. undoubtably the star of "the empire strikes back", yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen.rotj really is luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original. his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate. the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. the romance between leia (carrie fisher) and solo is all but non-existant, unlike in "empire". in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj, solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion. this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all, while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) darth vader. the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than governor tarkin (peter cushing) from "star wars", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid, the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. hamill surprises as the more wisened luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series. ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the real star of the first film after all. fisher's leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about... add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi, yoda and the loveable chewbacca, c-3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on endor, in space and on the death star, each with very impressive special effects. the music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance. just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for "2001: a space odyssey", john williams' score is as much a part of "star wars" folklore as light sabers and the force.lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made. indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii, viii and ix in their heads over and over again. rotj works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.when all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made. is it already? the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series. this is why "return of the jedi" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.

i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10, but that this one isn't even in the top 100.this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:-the rescue of han solo from jabba: this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope.-the emperor was finally revealled: well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids.-the speeder bike chase: alright, so this was a special effects moment. but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!-the 3 part climax: 1) the battle of endor (led by han and leia) 2) luke confronts his father & the fall of the emperor 3) the destruction of the second death star (lando's moment)-the final celebration with our heroes: like i said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story.

as a 90 minute experience, it is not up to the standard of `drive', as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the `who am i?' academy, while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat 'em-up. however, those who enjoyed `drive', (and i thought it was wonderful!), will undoubtedly enjoy this too. you certainly won't rewind back to the start and watch it all again, but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come. it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced, even if not in hong kong, and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets, time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen woo-ping and corey yuen kuei. if you sit through the first half hour and aren't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat. bosch is magnificent, and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of bravery. if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy, then track it down and watch it. it's not shakespeare. in fact, it's less articulate than coolio in `china strike force', but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team - (i'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head, or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car!?).

this movie has great fight scenes. now its true that the acting is a little rough. but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty. but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix. then watch this. now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p**s his pants. and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire.

its no surprise that busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity, this film is also a poor decision, but one i enjoyed fully. the first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with a spiderman stance, busey yells the best-worst line in any film ever created..."your worst nightmare butthorn!" i coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard. that line resonates so well, it even tops clooney's infamous "hi freeze, i'm batman" line. other classic moments is busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex-cia partner killed...which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest (all made possible by a super slow-motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting). there's an ashtray to the nads, punches to the face, and a "that wasn't my fault and you know it!" well, the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy, so... other scream out-loud moments has to be his ex girl-friend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape--a plan that defies all logic, physics, and absurdity. and lastly, when mcbain jumps out of the thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and starts to run and hurdles a small object, i almost wet myself. some of busey's best work by far, rent or buy it today "butthorn!" my vote is a perfect 10 (on the poo meter that is).

gary busey is the title character, frank "bulletproof" mcbain, your standard-issue reckless maverick cop who's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and counting), he never stops going after the bad guys.when a cutting-edge u.s. tank dubbed "thunderblast" is driven across the border into mexico, it's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by general brogado (rene enriquez) and libyan colonel kartiff (henry silva), who's aligned himself with russian villains. the army personnel involved are kept as prisoners, chief among them devon shepard (darlanne fluegel), who happens to be mcbain's ex-girlfriend. mcbain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission.busey may not have the physical presence of say, someone like schwarzenegger, who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type, but he's a blast as a self- confident dude who's quick with the wisecracks. fluegel is a great female lead; she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt-kicking action babe. enriquez, silva, juan fernandez, and the always welcome william smith (as a russian major) are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition. the supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors: l.q. jones, r.g. armstrong, thalmus rasulala, lincoln kilpatrick, mills watson, luke askew, danny trejo, and cary-hiroyuki tagawa.t.l. lankford and b.j. goldman supply the script, based on a story by lankford and veteran b director fred olen ray. it's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks: they know their material is absurd and cheesy, and just have fun throwing credibility out the window. veteran action director steve carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire, explosions, and general all-out mayhem."bulletproof" is good fun for the action fan who doesn't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor.7/10

guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that's just the first ten minutes. this action-packed film involving a rogue ex-cia mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. tough and toothy gary busey, usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks, has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued: after all he's carrying the entire show. which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith, luke askew, mills watson, r.g. armstrong, henry silva, lincoln kirkpatrick, thalmus rasulala, and several other "forgotten" character-actors. there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story: busey has to free a group of "kidnapped" american military elites and return a high-tech "supertank" (a normal tank with a cheesy add-on pasted to the top) back to the states. but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys? this question is asked, of course, like in any film centering on the cia... but without getting preachy.

this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage. straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks, shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can't help but amuse and entertain. there are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one...danny trejo. and if you don't know who danny trejo is then you probably won't like this film.

i caught this film late on a sat night/ sunday morning with my brother. we had been drinking. this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen. from the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film rocks!! the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it, it slaps you in the face with the holes. in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. cut to his son and new girlfriend (the ships pr director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ......then the dad is there hugging them. how???? who cares, its magic. there is not one redeeming feature to this film. the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide, you've guessed it. enter the villains who, instead of checking under the one table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and 'take them out'.get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl.

robot jox doesn't suffer from story or bad effects. i mean, this was 1990 if you know what i'm talking about. robocop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s. if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time. it wasn't until terminator 2: judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized, and story boarders began to use that motive. but you'll have fond memories of transformers, gundam wing, even power rangers, if you watch this film. the enemy robot is very menacing. it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back-up plan. and there are some great moments within this film. a traitor/spy is working within their midsts. who you think is on your side, backing you up all the way, could be the person you didn't expect him/her to be. and that's very troublesome to think so, don't you agree?

yep, you read that right, kids. michael bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped, overlong, overly pointless "transformers" movies. "robot jox" is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the "transformers" crew spent on megan fox's personal trainer.thankfully, this little robotic gem, initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert band's empire pictures studio, seems to have developed a cult following over the years. i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold war-era politics/stereotypes were already out of date by that time (just the bands' luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released, eh?), it's still a pretty damn cool little b-movie. they really don't make'em like this anymore, or if they do, they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportions.for those who are unfamiliar, here's the robo-scoop: we're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust, large scale "wars" have been outlawed. disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano (or perhaps that should be machine-o-machine-o) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots. whichever 'bot walks away from the fight wins for "his" side. gary graham (who would later go on to play detective sykes in the "alien nation" tv series), plays "achilles," the greatest robot jock in marketplace (a.k.a. the good guys) history. achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts (ten being the maximum number of battles before a "jock" is retired) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the "confederation" (i.e. the russkies!), the psychotic alexander (who is the most over the top "evil russian" stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgren's infamous turn as ivan drago in "rocky iv"). the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles, but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain. a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout, but achilles simply wants to bow out, hang up his helmet and move on with his life. rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more, i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns, behind the scenes skullduggery, and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow "jox" before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale.i hope i'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction, because it isn't. "robot jox" is just plain fun. i'll grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average b-grade sci-fi movie, and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known (especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery), it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empire/full moon pictures factory. the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques, and the sets and costumes don't look half-assed in the slightest. empire pictures and director stuart ("re-animator") gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture. unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them (or the studio) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal. bottom line: if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours, feel free to rent a "transformers" movie. by the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game. if you want to have a rock'em, sock'em robot good time, pick up robot jox instead.

from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life. the idea of two giant robots, manned by brilliant humans, fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced. i can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script. let's just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures , combined. the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is.....robot jox.

after seeing this excellent film over 100 times, i still find new things that blow me away with this movie, great special effects, incredible acting, and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism, and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well. best movie ever!!!

the one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. not only a movie but an incredible future vision, this movie establishes a new standard of s/f movies. hail and kill!

hrm-i think that line was from the old movie posters.this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator. here's a tip: any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading "in the future..." is going to be fun. this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you.in this case, "in the future..." means that, instead of fighting wars, nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine, well, that's never terribly clear, but it's probably something really important. there are good guys (obviously capitalists, i.e. "us") and bad guys (commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots.sadly, the effects budget was pretty slim, so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots. there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. the space fight is especially nice, as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget.with said money now spent, the climactic fight degenerates into (and i'm not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. i can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.like i said-it's dumb. that's why i bought the tape.

the scenes are fast-paced. the characters are great. i love anne-marie johnson's acting. i really like the ending. however, i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship. it only blossomed when they kissed each other.

what a master piece. to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future. this film is satire of the highest order. in my humble opinion it outranks dr. strangelove.the clever naming of the two superpowers, as the confederation and the market. cons being commies and market, the west! outstanding. the clever use of gen joxs, was ahead of its time. only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering. robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989.the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government. this movies screams don't do it you fools you'll kill us all.excellent 10/10

note to previous reviewer: this movie is "science-fiction adaptation of the iliad" according to the screenwriter. so whether the references are painful or not, no apologies, it is the basis for the film. they admit they stole...though adapted is the p.c. term.great flick but too short. probably didn't come out as well as the author, director, or studio wanted, but pretty damn fun. the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy.a big-budget remake wouldn't be as fun, and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice. but it's fun to dream about the potential there. a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players. i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out. for now, i live with the vhs incarnation.

ok, this movie was cool. i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. judgment is victory for robot jox.

robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age. you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts. so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it.

one of the best movies out there. yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. something different from the usual movies and great fun. one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while. the sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the film. this movie is very hard to find on dvd, but also on vhs. check it out cause i have loved it since it came out. not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. take a look and think like a child. it's a great view and very fun.

my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots. so i try to seek out movies that have robots. and this movie has robots. big ones. they beat the clang and bang out of each other, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. it's really cool. you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. it is very hard to dislike this movie. because of those big robots. they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! it made my girlfriend smile. and that is good enough for me. and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo: as the maniacal russian villain, whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste "like blood" (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-bela lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation.

what a great film it is. the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky. the ending is not just a fitting one, it's more inspirational.but i am intrigued by the characters. it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and athena's fear for achilles's safety. their romance is very enjoyable.

i remember this movie from when i was 12, it was amazing.. i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then, i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh*t! anyway, the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch, i must have watched it about 20 times. it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots, pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off "crash and burn", don't watch that movie by the way it is total pants! if your a real sci-fi movie fan then watch this, if it was re-made today it would be a winner.. i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it.

now i've always been a fan of full moon's puppet work. but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects. yes, you heard me. the story works wonderful, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job. gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name. the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better. the color was wrong, they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be. but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox, if you like gary graham or other full moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 stars out of 10.

this movie i've loved since i was young! its excellent. although, it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film (for example, our hero's name is achilles, and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the heel with a rocket, just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel). that's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing! anyway, great movie, good story, it'd be neat to see it redone with today's special effects! oddly enough, gary graham had average success, starring in the t.v. show alien nation. this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!

if you like mech war games it's pretty good. some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing. i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $350 to spare steel battalion. the movie is worth seeing at least once. there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there. less remakes and more original works. enjoy

robot jox tries hard, but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together -- robot against robot, man against man, man against woman. the premise had potential, but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed. still, it was fairly good, for a science fiction action movie. part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman. for those who aren't familiar with the name, haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "the forever war." it's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels, right up there with robert heinlein's "starship troopers" and john steakley's "armor." and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie, rather than giant robots. it's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven's "starship troopers," which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on.despite some assumptions, this really isn't based on homer's "iliad." a couple of names are all they had in common. achilles having his robot's foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad, which didn't include achilles' death. nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior. he was the mightiest, but also vengeful and petty. even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit. he was named hercules, while the greek iliad would have had herakles.the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget. true, it wasn't comparable to "terminator 2" a year later, but that movie cost ten times as much. the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in "the empire strikes back" and "return of the jedi." better, in fact, than a lot of ray harryhausen animation, which is highly regarded, but quite dated.don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed. it's better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts.

i read somewhere (in a fairly panning review) that this is something of a live-action mecha anime, and i think they're on the right lines. i first watched this movie when i was very young and i've been dying to see it again, and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back. i don't think this is to be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of good old 80's almost-a-tv-movie fun (it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future, although this point isn't stressed too much). what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn't sound generic - no clichés, no predictable lines - all in all just good fun! maybe time hasn't been kind to this little movie, but still i can find appreciation for it in me. it's by no means perfect, but it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything other than that. let the nerds and comic-store-guys worry about technicalities - who cares? see it for yourself and make your own decision. no-one else's opinion matters.

this film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason. probably just by the mass populace. anyhow, this is actually a very interesting movie. the film is an under-budget sci-fi movie which actually works, due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes. this movie may not be for everyone though. if there are any sci-fi fans reading this, i truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction. the film has crazy ideas. the setting includes nations going to war with gigantic machines which the entire countries invest all it's money in! the world has been divied up into territories. anyone can challenge anyone else to a war, or rather, a 'robot-duel'. the method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, since now everyone is wearing those breath masks. definetly a movie that makes you think. intelligent, well written, and good effects for the measly budget.i tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work.

zatoichi the outlaw was the first film made by its hero's (shintaro katsu) own production company, this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series, though it is by no means weak overall. it tells of our hero coming across two towns, rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy, violence and no little interest, all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks. it is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion, but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff. the helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character, upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure, zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions, whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor. its a harsh world, with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting, though things aren't as rousing as they could be. shintaro katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as zatoichi, mixing wisdom, deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability, while solid work comes also from rentarô mikuni and an effectively baleful kô nishimura (later to appear as katsu's superior "snake" magobei in the hanzo trilogy) as the two main bosses in the film. there is also a good emotional turn from yuko hamada as a wronged woman. the film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events, there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost, meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be, emotional impact is lost also. the action or scenes of zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director satsuo yamamoto, though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way, without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments. still, i enjoyed this one, it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment, a good story and decent doses of zatoichi's trademark ingenious and quirky cool. recommended for fans of the series, and a reasonable entry point, classy stuff though not a true great.

this is one of the oddest films of the zatôichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that ichi plays in the film. interestingly enough, this was the first zatôichi film made by shintaro katsu's new production company. now, instead of just playing the blind swordsman, katsu is in charge of making the films. this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films. as far as ichi's role, the film is very different because he isn't in the film as much as usual. he's also easy to fool and actually, for a while, does a lot to harm people instead of helping! "zatôichi rôyaburi" begins with ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness. oddly, in this scene, ichi says that he's been blind since a toddler, though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8. this is a minor mistake, and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed.this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year--so you can see what i said about odd pacing. most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks. ichi comes to a town where there is a boss (asagoro) who tries very hard to be nice to ichi because he knows of the blind man's reputation. the boss is quite charming and surprisingly ichi is totally taken in by the evil man. at the same time, he meets another boss (shushui)--a sort of guru to the poor. shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even ichi falls under his teaching--giving up his blade for many months. shushui's teachings are very similar to daoist teachings from china--non-violence and acceptance of life as it is (for good or for bad). months after leaving this town and thinking all was well, ichi learns that as soon as he left, asagoro showed his true colors--enslaving women, oppressing the poor and being an all-around jerk. in a way, ichi is responsible for this, as he helped asagoro and counted him as a friend. now, asagoro has captured shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss' actions.when ichi returns, he doesn't accept automatically that asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly. this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where, what else, ichi kills the baddies and frees shushui. this finale was very good and occurred in the rain. then final scene with asagoro and the rocks is great, though the beheading is a tad cheesy by today's special effects standards.pluses for the film are that although poorly paced, it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15 (which often seem very similar). additionally, it does end very well. minuses (aside from pacing) are that some might dislike seeing ichi so fallible and the scenes with ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat...very, very, very flat. they are tacky and unfunny...that's the sort of flat that it is.

if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best. it is good enough, as most of them are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. the situation is unusually intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of grange; both run afoul of the usual local gangsters, who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land; their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites. (he also resembles dracula, as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do.) these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally, but by now he has lost many of his nuances, and the changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed, need more time then the movie has to give, so that the story seems choppy, as if some scenes were missing. other than that, the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a vivid, believable, and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it), and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist. and of course there is the keynote actor, whose presence, as much as his performance, makes it all work. this must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history.

how i got into it: when i started watching this series on cartoon network,i have to say that i've never seen anything like this,and it was the best. but when i started collecting the series on vhs,and years later on dvd part of bandai's anime legends collections. it was amazing,and truly worth watching. it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat. and of course,the theme songs "just communication",and rhythm emotions" were the best.characters,and gundams: my favorite characters in the show were:heero,duo,relena,treize,lady und,noin,and zechs. my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero,and epyon,and of course the altron,and deathscythe i,and ii.meaning of the show: what this series also tells us that in real life,wars are very hard and we can sometimes win,or lose. but peace can also be hard to obtain,and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing,and are trying to obtain world peace.but however,this show is truly the best of the best. so in closing to this review,after you watch this show,see the movie endless waltz.

over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - check! weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - check! mobile suits based on angels - check!ok - its a gundam series. this one, gundam wing, has good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy.with characters, the initially weak relena dorlan (later peacecraft, then back to dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy, the series main character). the aforementioned heero, initially a cold, hard butcherer, becomes more and more human, while still remaining in-character. and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise) float between oz, freelance, and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations.the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works. however, in 49 half-hour episodes, it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn't used to its full potential.the ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting, the desire for peace, etc - are ones that resonate even today. in retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the "war on terrorism" and all. but its exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of treize kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece, forming some of the best writing in the series.but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor, which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge.in terms of eye-candy, which is what this one has in bucketloads, everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra (no not the tampons you idiot!) is wells designed, and explodes in big balls of orange (which is bad, because better animation would've had better explosions). but who cares?! stuff explodes, and thats all that matters.in short though, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes, you've missed out on a lot. the poor writing can leave you cringing, and sometimes the animation makes you go "wtf?!?!" but this is made up for in its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration that one expects of such japenese animations.

i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing, they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss.it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months... years, and then go back to and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub). it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series. the relationship between heero and relena, and milliardo and noin are joys to watch. the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely, if at all see, which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic. it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but he gets there, and when he does, its a big pay off. and then there's the giant robot fighting. fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene. any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids, as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos, usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating, thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body.

the second alternate gundam universe tale (g-gundam being the first), gundam wing is yet another different view into the gundam verse. the familiar elements are found but gundam wing is actually different then its counterparts. the biggest being the gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization. in truth, the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict, the eve wars, don't happen until the later episodes. the greatest positives of this series are it's characters. all the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in. another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. the designs put some of it's other gundam counterparts to shame. one of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard uc fans claim rip off of the original uc saga. why gundam wing gets this rap when the more apparent uc clone of gundam seed is out there is beyond me. true there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well.take for example, the usual comparison of zechs merquise and uc icon char aznable. throughout the series, zechs is more the outcast in the alliance and in ways oz as well, while the red comet was shining symbol of zeon. another big difference is the fact zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he's given in the early episodes: "killer of his own men." char isn't given this label. the problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems. the first is the reused animation footage of the gundams attacks. sure it's fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks, ms, and planes the first time. but on it's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old. the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year. if you really think about all the events springing in the series, a lot happens in just one lone year. but i guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often. as it ranks, this is probably the best of the alternate universe gundam tales and a great introduction into the gundam world. after all, this was the very first gundam anime to air in the us television.

while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series, upon re-watching the series, i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam design, character design, and character depth are masterfully executed. while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art, with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters. consequently, it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character. personally, i liked heero because of his stoic personality. while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we obtain peace?) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits, which, to say the least, is excellent.

i've watched almost all of the gundam/mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story. the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted. gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war. the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams. the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz. as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate. old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting. but, how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal. i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot.

gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime. a bit slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but over all enjoyable. now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a "winger", i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam, gundam 0080 and 0083, the 08th ms team, and gundam seed.i will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be "rip-offs" (i.e. zechs marquise to the original gundam's char), but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series, as is seed.if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first, and then know that you are watching an au series.

gundam wing is an amazing show from start to finish, every single episode is a joy to watch. the story is typical gundam fare, in the future earth's populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand. the story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other gundam show. it is the year after colony 195 and the corrupt earth government, known as the earth sphere alliance, is violently taking over the free colonies. to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come (an evil militaristic organization hiding within the alliance known as oz, which later takes control of earth and the colonies), select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come. these mechs, known as gundams, fight oz and try to regain peace in the colonies as oz takes the front-stage, completely eliminating the alliance and taking control of earth and its colonies.gundam wing as i previously stated, is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion. a large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before it, but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other gundam series. gundam wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other gundam show i have ever seen thus far. this particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle. now don't get me wrong, this show still has many epic battles within it, and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other gundam series have, but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1.no matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there, and i strongly recommend it to any fan of anime, or sci-fi in general. the show sports some amazing animation and superb action, but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more. the characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them. this show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed.a perfect 10/10!

i'm not a big fan of most anime, but gundam wing is truly something else. gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits, gundam wing gets right down to business. gundam wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series. large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war, not only the battles. though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate, individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. to my knowledge, this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000, and then professionally dubbed by them too. the dubbing is simply flawless. not only does every word said match up, but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable. many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in english, but i simply don't have the determination to do that. not only are the voices good, but the score used over the series is quite impressive. i'll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack. the plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers, and no, not hook you like some prime time drama like lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you. explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series. the rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace. thus a war is started, leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. i feel that any more detail would begin to give away information, which is crucial to the plot. i'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime, anyone that thinks all anime is stupid (they have good reason to think so), and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it.

gundam wing is a fun show. i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general. however, after watching its predecessors, such as mobile suit gundam, zeta gundam, and even g gundam, i find wing to be gundam lite.characters: an aspect long held by gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity. this does not happen in wing. heero is top dog at the beginning, and he's top dog at the end. personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. the best character is zechs, who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series. but suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.mecha: wing has great suit designs. the gundams are super cool, with the epyon being my favorite. i even consider a few of the oz suit designs to be on par with some of the classic zeon suits. but sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters.conclusion: in the end, wing has cool fight scenes, though riddled with recycled animation, but shallow plot and character development. enjoyable, but not moving like previous gundam outings.

since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english, i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing(2000) as presented in the bandai released dvd set. my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of ""shin kidô senki gundam w"(1995).very little is changed in respect to plot, script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in. purists can stick to japanese all they want, but for a more "realistic" experience i recommend the english track since all the characters, except heero yuy, are not japanese.(most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non-japanese asians.) for one thing, the characters' personalities come across more "directly" than in the japanese version. the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take performances but a very well cast group of actors.wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity. voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad acting" but it matches heero's personality very well.deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell, ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends. he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show, masterfully played by scott mcneil. he may sound a little too old for his age, but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one.trowa, the pilot of heavyarms, is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to befriend. kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton.quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand. a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl(and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version) but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy.the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over-the-top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa.relena darlian sounds older in english, voiced by lisa ann bailey. this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story, her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development.zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version. both voices bring out different sides to the same character. his japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and commands respect , keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature. his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued, sounding more devious and "snake-like", highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals.the members of oz are a mixed bag really. treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life japanese style of speaking. however, lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds.........bored most of the time. the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either.i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents. the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility.despite underwhelming acting from the side characters, the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script. very faithful to the original japanese script, keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics, war and human nature. sadly, it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script.

i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes, i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow, yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling. i am still a fan.....with some minor pains.though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything(sound familiar?), i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plans(especially the character called wufei...i mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera. get a counselor,will ya?)besides for the over-exaggerated drama(i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again. i mean it can always be worse. it could be like the recent installment, seed......eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic....i'll chat about that one later.

mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles. unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars, this one is a little different; instead of having an army-vs.-army situation, this one is led by five teenage boys (due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults) and their machines called "gundams" because of the metal alloy used in their construction. which leads to problems, since gundams are supposed to be destroyed, replaced by "mobile suits", which are piloted less-destructive weapon platforms and "dolls" which are ran on a.i. and are used as grunt infantry.the whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes it's way here. especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines, such as naruto, dragonball, one piece, dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump, which is now available in america.mobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over-the-top battles between mortals who more resemble gods, gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully. normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a "small" battle is to have it take a half-hour - something that would never happen in real life. gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die, machines will be destroyed and rebuilt, battles will be lost and won, and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical.but the magic of gundam wing is in the details, and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having. emotion. instead of mythic prophecies, magic, or overblown martial arts, gundam wing is hard-line science fiction from a country that hates hard-line science fiction. (note: the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hard-line-plausible-in-real-life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series) they love star wars, but hate a.i. (the movie). henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and u.s. releases at the same time with two voice teams. american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon network.the emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards. the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing. this is not war, this is "total war". every person, every building, every street is a target for attack, both on earth and off.my only complaint, and the reason it didn't get the score of ten, is that at about three-fourths of the way through, it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes, and no one really seems to change. kind of like a present-time flashback, which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters, but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project: meteor and oz. but the final two episodes and the overplayed-on-cartoon-network (back in 2001-2003) mobile suit gundam wing: endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack.

dear readers,with high expectations, human beings leave earth to begin a new life in space colonies. however, the allied forces of the united earth sphere alliance gain great military control over the colonies and soon seize one colony after another in the name of justice and peace...the year is after colony 195. operation meteor. in a move to counter the alliance's tyranny, rebel forces from several colonies send new arsenals to earth disguised as shooting stars...however...the alliance forces catch on...gundam wing is the most popular and most successful of the entire gundam series. with cutting-edge anime animation, stunning action, amazing mobile suits, breathtaking scripts, and some of the most unforgettable characters in anime history.i'll try to explain the plot of gundam wing as best as possible. earth has now colonized space, but the uesa forces have forcibly occupied them along with the help of the mysterious elite force oz and their shadowy leaders, treize kushrenada and the romefeller foundation. five pilots are sent to earth piloting mobile suits with extraordinary power known as the gundams. pursued by the mysterious lieutenant zechs merquise, treize's second-in-command, a young teenager named relena, and the alliance military, the gundam pilots unleash hell upon earth for the freedom of the colonies while all the while, a plot most sinister architected by treize begins to start.signed, the constant dvd collector

i generally love these 1930 mystery/police charlie chan type of movies, and this is no exception. however, something seems bad with this movie. a late attempt to switch from cerebral moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet. a typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief. the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today, but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real, but a commonplace occurrence.

a team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the crown of the queen of sheeba. from egypt, the crown is to be transferred via steamship to san francisco. but it won't be an easy journey. there are plenty of would-be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown. fortunately for all involved, mr. moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey. however, that doesn't mean someone won't try to get their hands on the treasure.after the disappointment of mr. moto's gamble, i went into mr. moto takes a vacation hoping for the best, but, admittedly, fearing the worst. but within the first 10 seconds of the film, i knew i would find it more enjoyable. i'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in egypt. and seeing moto disguised as a german archaeologist (imagine that, peter lorre playing a german?), the beginning scenes really drew me in. while the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic san francisco, it remained just as enjoyable. dark, sinister characters lurking in the rainy night; gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero's head; sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them; and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that i love. and mr. moto takes a vacation's got 'em all. a couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable lionel atwill in a nice little role, comic relief from g.p. huntley that's actually funny, and a return to form for mr. moto. i've already mentioned his disguise in the movie's opening scenes, well the athletic moto comes out near the film's finale. moto is a like a whirling dervish of activity as he goes after his prey. all this and i haven't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre. any way you look at it, mr. moto takes a vacation is a winner.as much as i hate that the mr. moto series had to end after this installment, it's understandable when you think about it. wwii was just around the corner. and after pearl harbor, a movie with a japanese hero wouldn't have gone over very well. at least the mr. moto series ended on a very positive note.

this is one of my favorite mr. motos, and i have seen them all. as usual lorre is his charming self as the debonair mr. moto. lionel atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator, the usual comic relief is quite funny here, and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye. it's fast paced and fun.the archaeologist doesn't have quite the same flair as thomas beck, the usual second lead in these programmers, but he's adequate. stepin fetchit is on board, and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny, not demeaning to his intelligence, and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen.

you play as b.j. blazkowicz, a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii. that means everything from breaking out of a nazi dungeon to thwarting hitler's war machine and even the fuhrer himself.this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time. that's because it literally inspired obsession. many games existed at the time and even more do today, but every so often you get a real grabber. this is one of them. just like tetris before it and more recently gta iii in 2002. yes, doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by b.j. blazkowicz. the space marine, duke nukem, max payne, serious sam, john mullins, jc denton, agent 47, gordon freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at id. whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.even with its old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games now border on the "experience level") and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun. especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.also: "halt!" *bang! bang! bang!* "aarrrgh!!!" never grows old. --- 8/10voluntarily rated pc-13 for "profound carnage." however, it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today.

many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game, or even the first shoot-'em-up. it's also one of the first stealth games, one of the only(and definitely the first) truly claustrophobic games, and just a pretty well-rounded gaming experience in general. with graphics that are terribly dated today, the game thrusts you into the role of b.j.(don't even *think* i'm going to attempt spelling his last name!), an american p.o.w. caught in an underground bunker. you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes(but, let's face it, most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon, surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders). the graphics are, as i mentioned before, quite dated and very simple. the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators. if you can get over that, however(and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you), then you've got one heck of a good shooter/sneaking game. the game play consists of searching for keys, health and ammo, blasting enemies(aforementioned nazis, and a "boss enemy" per chapter) of varying difficulty(which, of course, grows as you move further in the game), unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms. there is a bonus count after each level is beaten... it goes by how fast you were(basically, if you beat the 'par time', which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level; this can be quite fun to try and beat, and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in, they are even challenging after many play-throughs), how much nazi gold(treasure) you collected and how many bad guys you killed. basically, if you got 100% of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach the coveted high score placings. the game (mostly, but not always) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see. you can either run or walk, and amongst your weapons is also a knife... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard, as is gunshots. many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you, meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them... nearly silently. in your inventory, you can get no less than four weapons and two keys... more about the weapons later. the keys unlock certain doors. most doors in the game aren't locked... only two kinds need keys, and these keys are only introduced in later levels(you restart in levels, resetting weaponry, health, score and lives in each chapter). much of the later game is spent looking for them. now, as i just alluded to, this game, like many of the period(late 80's, early 90's), is based on collecting extra lives... personally, i think it's completely and utterly useless(it was mercifully dropped from here on end... i think(?), from the next 3d shooter and onwards), since you can save anytime you want and 'using a life' resets weaponry, health and ammo, like starting on a new chapter(which is a real pain in later levels, where you *need* heavier artillery). now, i shall beat around the bush no longer... moving on to the guns! you start with aforementioned knife(which is silent but only effective up close) and a pistol... nothing special, but good for conserving ammo, unlike the next two bad boys. your third weapon is a german smg... a sub-machine-gun. it's faster and automatic, and some later enemies use it. and the last one... is nothing short of a gatling gun! oh yeah! think t2. think predator. think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun. it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds. most of the boss enemies use this, though, so be prepared. i won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies, however... that's for each player to discover for him(or her)self. the sound is excellent... very crisp and realistic. as you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing, the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german, you truly feel like you are there, trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems. that segues me nicely into the level design... as you run through seemingly countless, nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further, you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood. i almost got motion sickness more than once(though that might also have something to do with little sleep, lots of humidity and unusual warmth...) from playing. though the level of detail isn't terribly high, what there is is great. remains of victims, guards' quarters and countless nazi symbols... the list goes on. the game also features quite a bit of gore... for it's limited graphics engine, john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game. what is there left to say... the first of its kind, and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters. sure, weapon bobbing and different height levels(stairs and such) didn't come around until the next entry into the genre... doom... and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view(so it goes beyond simply left and right, adding vertical dimensions to it), and jumping didn't come around until a third, later title(the first quake, possibly? fellow gamers, help me out here)... but all of those games, as well as the rest of the genre, owe their existence to this one. so load up the luger, open the door to enter the bunker and step into b.j.'s shoes... he deserves the recognition, even(or maybe even especially?) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared. i recommended this to all fans of 3d games. 8/10

. . .but it was on a uhf channel and the reception was very fuzzy. i'd really like to own the movie since the reason i watched it in the first place is because i am a bus driver and at the time i saw this movie, i was driving that model bus. it was only (during his murder trial some 15 years later) that i remember vaguely that oj was one of the stars in it. i only recall that he was the driver and of the bus' being shot up and driven wildly. i've been looking all over for this movie to no avail, since viewing it in the mid-80s. i liked the movie, i don't usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the tv guide, and viewing its beginning (although fuzzy) i stayed for the whole thing.

well you take o.j. simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just incase no one else is going to and arte johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who doesn't know what to do but doesn't want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with lorenzo lamas as one of three baby faced bad boys who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a busload of people to die on the dessert and you have got to have action, plot twists and a lot of drama. everyone was good but seeing lamas as the baddest of the bad boys really blew my mind. he was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him. this was evidently long before he cultivated his good guy image. and believe me a 20 year old lorenzo in tight jeans you really don't want to miss!

lupin sets off for morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. it's a nice different location for lupin, with the desert and that hot exotic feel.one interesting thing about this movie is that jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place than lupin. on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed, but it is a change of pace. plus, this way, lupin can focus on the ladies...fujiko rules in this. throughout the entire feature she is seducing lupin, and us viewers. then there's lara, the damsel of this particular tale, and she's quite likable. this one has more nudity than any other lupin anime, which is a fun distinction to have.there's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this, and naturally he has some great fighting with goemon, as well as some fun scenes with fujiko. inspector zenigata of course is also on a warpath here, in fine form.pretty much, this is a smooth ride with lupin. the plot is average and there are some slow spots, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure. enjoy.

this movie is more lupin then most, especially coming from funimation. other then the bad dub, it isn't bad.the first hour is a lot like the comic (which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on). lupin's trying to get a huge treasure. fujiko's using lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it. the last bit isn't that bad, he's with another women, but of course fujiko's still him number one.a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin. any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised (i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie). it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but overall, it isn't a bad film. good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies.

this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it, it has lot's of laughs, guns, action, crime,, good one liners, and a decent plot, with an over the top, donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain. tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too, thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character "max" a dea agent diane is the fbi agent, played by carerra, and john lithgow from frazier on tv, plays the bad guy,, "livingston". the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throw into the mix the assassain sutherland, who pretty much has all the good one liners, this is the perfect crime caper, there is the usual love story,, but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith. you also have the russian mafia, italian mafia, and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix,, the film is shot in boston,, where you have some great shots , and locals,, great photography and music in this film, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy,, it has everything that one could ever want. check out sutherland's toilet in a particular scene,, very unusual. this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me.

hollow point, though clumsy in places, manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie.the primary entertainment value here is humor - everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy.oh, by the way, advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie...

i think hollow point is a funny film with some good moments i have never seen before in action movies. well,both tia carrere and thomas ian griffith aren't so good in acting, but tia carrere is nice and good looking girl, isn't it? but donald sutherland is superb in his role so-so mad gangster.

this film is one of the finest american b-movies of the 90s. if you're looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. however, if you're looking for some action, a lot of laughs, and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters, this is well worth watching. everyone chews the scenery a bit, but that's really what the film is all about, and everyone is quite funny. donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together.

the plot: a crime lord is uniting 3 different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island, that would then serve as money-laundering facility for organized crime. to thwart that, the fbi tries to bust one of the mafia lords. the thing goes wrong, and by some unlikely plot twists and turns, we are presented with another "cop buddies who don't like each other" movie... one being a female fbi agent, and the other a male ex-dea agent.so far, so stupid. but the strength of this movie does not lie in its story - a poor joke, at best. it is funny. (at least the synchronized german version is). the action is good, too, with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher. but the focus is squarely on the humour. not intelligent satire, not quite slapstick, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of funny jokes. however, this film is the opposite of political correctness. legal drug abuse is featured prominently, without criticism, and even displaying it as cool. that's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me, and renders it unsuitable for kids, in my opinion. all in all, for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. just remember: in this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / tv room. then you'll have a good time. 8/10

the only thing serious about this movie is the humor. well worth the rental price. i'll bet you watch it twice. it's obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role.

this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. it shows us that real life and "ficticious" action can produce a winning combination. also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other. name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like "they're going to find your anus on a mountain on mars."

love the characters and the story line. very funny with plenty of action. thomas ian griffith and tia carrer give great performances. i enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of griffith and career. donald southerland plays a very likable, and surprisingly sympathetic, burnt out hit man. all three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat. a nice addition to my extensive dvd collection. i highly recommend this movie. if you like... mr. and mrs. smith, the replacement killers, l.a. confidential, the long kiss goodnight, the abyss and, the whole nine yards... you will love this movie.

welcome back kiefer sutherland. it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie,, and what a movie this was, was it 24 no,, but very intriguing, especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent. kiefer's character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie,, kiefer's partner,, is eva longoria,, the desperate houswife. wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good,, i wish though that kim bassinger had a bigger role,, but other than that, i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller, everybody played their part to the hilt. nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie,, so as to keep you guessing at all times. and i really think that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie,, but in my opinion michael douglas had the besxt performance of the day,, thumbs up.

my take: makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement. the plot is familiar. an innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the president of the united states, the first traitor in the united states secret service. as his fellow secret-service agents pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. of course we know his innocent, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but i was still entertained by the sentinel. in this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too abundant in action sequences, the sentinel is a good lick-back to all those good old-fashioned political crime thriller. the familiar plot is elevated by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances.michael douglas, the perfect man for the job, is long-running secret service agent pete garrison, who is framed for being part of a plot to assassinate the president. former colleagues in the secret service (kiefer sutherland and eva longoria) pursue harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the secret service. this leads to a lot of chase scenes that, surprisingly (and thankfully), are never unbelievable. the screenplay also offers a subplot involving garrison having an affair with the first lady (played by kim basinger). this thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films.the films director is clark johnson (s.w.a.t.) who manages to make the film look good. although many have criticized it as "should have been a tv movie", i must disagree. agreed, this is not a perfect film, and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political intrigues like in the line of fire or an episode from the tv series 24 (which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star sutherland), but even so, this film takes its plot into serious heights and doesn't abandon even its smaller details. the performances are terrific (with a top-notch cast, its bound to be, even with the by-the-numbers script.all-in-all, i award it ***1/2, not perfect, but not far from it.rating: ***1/2 out of 5.

it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about.the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate. the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this: a plot to kill the president of the united states. michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed.kiefer sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine. one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president,it also concerns a mole(traitor) in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction.

i'll be honest,i finally checked this movie not because of the stars--though they were reasonably watchable and compelling,particularly the three leads--or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service(something,i've been informed through the dvd extras of this show,has yet to ever happen.assuming that's true,that's remarkable!). i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective meldrick lewis!! well,okay,clark johnson,one of my faves from "homicide:life on the street" and a veteran (mostly) tv director. i'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average,despite the possibilities.veteran and ace secret agent pete garrison(michael douglass)has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend,targeted and blew up an air force one chopper and is gunning for the prez.(david rasche. anyone remember "sledgehammer"?). his affair with the first lady(kim basinger,clearly one of the hotter first ladies we've ever had,fictional or real)is certainly not helping his standing. he's got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief(kiefer sutherland,almost still completely in "24" mode). throw in some other pivotal service agents(martin donovan and the foxy,somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva longorria) and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired,if underwhelming,results.the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers. the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie,though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most (myself included) interested.

seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this. i also think this applies to eva longoria fans.the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president. as the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete (michael douglas). pleading innocence, pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.it's solid, but certainly not spectacular. a decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, but you could certainly do far worse.

this was a pretty decent movie. this movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained. just a typical hollywood film. this movie will never win an oscar or anything and definitely doesn't deserve one, but i thought it was pretty good. it's kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format. if you like the whole we've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick. i personally think that storyline has been done way too much, but the sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the secret service. all in all, this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life, but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good?

good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and passionless; the president was a cardboard cut-out. and who were the real villains anyway? nothing was developed or explained sufficiently. i still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved. the villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. michael douglas and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good. but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles, basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent. this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way, with too many unanswered questions. disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes. and did they use the 'west wing' set for the white house scenes? - i kept expecting cj or charlie to appear!

the sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichéd suspense/mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing. these stories have already for the most part gone through as many permutations as we can bear, so what we're left with is how good is the acting, how smart are the setups and bad guys, how well crafted is the main plot etc etc.....so the sentinel does a solid job given it's content. michael douglass and kiefer sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes. eva longoria (first time i've seen her on screen) brings some satisfactory support. the whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit, but it deserves slack. worth a viewing if you like the genre.

the sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right.a great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasn't and it was a very smart story. michael douglas in this film is very good and keither sutherland is too,but however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as jack bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in the sentinel than he is in 24.also another person trying to shrug off their tv role but failed.eva longeria.she wasn't that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing.after i saw the film i had constant dreams about the sentinel and couldn't sleep.overall sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it.

i can admit that the screenplay isn't very good, and that it has some slow parts, but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun. first of all, the performances are great (michael douglas, kim basinger, kiefer sutherland, and eva longoria. michael douglas proves he has still got it, and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife. kiefer sutherland and eva longoria, play the dynamic duo, both adding their incredible talent to the pot. and second of all, this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore. its plain and simple, if you want to go to the movies, and have a lot of fun see, the sentinel.

i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.when i finally saw it,i took a good surprise.the movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done.this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or alias.it's very similar to that series and it reminded me too,to the wolfgang petersen's thriller in the line of fire.if you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies,you will be disappointed.but if you go with little expectations,you will enjoy the sentinel.rating:7

i enjoyed this film. i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot. unfortunately, for michael douglas' character, "pete garrison," they think he's the mole but he isn't. he's just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the first lady! since he's doing that, he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the president."garrison" is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. douglas does a fine job in this role. i don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor. keifer sutherland ("david breckinridge") is equally as good (at least in here) as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth. when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. the crooks are interesting, too, by the way. also, i have never - and never will, unfortunately - see a first lady who looks as good as kim basingerthis is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish. are there holes in it? of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments. however, it is unfairly bashed here. it just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website. my advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. yes, it gets a little rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment.....which is what movies are all about.

at first glance, this film looks like the keifer sutherland series 24 for the big screen. with the focus on a plot to assassinate the president of the united states, a race against time, and plenty of secret service agents, the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel.but wait, the protagonist turns out to be michael douglas' character pete garrison instead, a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981. the ss agents are specially trained to "take the bullet", which is what makes them special - who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target? but garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot, and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot. all this because of his failure in a polygraph test, due to his adulterous banging of the first lady (kim basinger). tsk.there are shades of clint eastwood's in the line of fire. both featured aging actors, and aging veteran has-been heroes with a bit of a historical reference, who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty. while eastwood's movie has a more enigmatic villain in john malkovich, the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain, preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex-kgb villains, and the mole within the presidential detail. with douglas on the run from the law, he becomes similar to dr. richard kimble of the fugitive, hunting the proverbial one-armed man while at the same time, relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents, which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes, it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents.keifer sutherland and eva longoria, top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate housewives, get relegated into support roles as the secret service investigators who are looking into garrison's probable involvement in the assassination plot, and at times seem to have lept off the pages of csi with their forensics skills. the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled x-files' fox mulder and dana scully, but alas these two had very little to do here. we know the reason why they're in the movie, and that is to get their fans into the theatres. also, longoria's role seemed unable to shake off her sexy-mama gabrielle, and here, has her in fairly low cut blouses (sutherland actually tells her to cover up) and tight pants (ogle-fest for fellow agents).nonetheless, it's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world, and the typical threats that they face daily, including the following up on every nutcase's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world. it's a decent suspense and investigative thriller, with enough subplots to keep you entertained. but one thing though, like most ending action sequences, this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through.

it's been 19 years since gordon gekko used "wall street" to let us know that greed is good. now, michael douglas takes the gg persona and morphs it into a secret service agent, pete garrison. guess what? it works! this is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. the detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the ss on behalf of the president and first lady was likewise intriguing. all the leads were pretty good but, try as i might, i could not accept eva longoria as a secret service agent. whereas jodie foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was fbi agent starling in "silence of the lambs", you do not get the same feeling with longoria. nevertheless, this is a fun film, escapist entertainment with the beltway as the backdrop.

there was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer. for starters, the casting didn't seem right. kiefer sutherland had already done very well in "24" and the preview didn't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience. eva longoria appeared out of place, and the rest didn't seem very interesting.when the film finally ended, i was not completely displeased for i had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better, had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development. we have seen threats of this type before, and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers. as an audience, we don't want to sit through the same old story again. we want to see something different, be thrilled and entertained.there is nothing wrong with the casting. from kim basinger's delicious first lady. she carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable. michael douglas has been and done that before. unfortunately, the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate. sutherland rehashes his "24" tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and eva does a passable job, as the newcomer.don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ("north by northwest" and "the fugitive" come to mind). leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be. it's o.k.

what if a platoon of g.i.'s from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate? great pitch right? the movie does exactly what it says on the tin.thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the, usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies, scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport. no how's or why's. they just did. however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful, if not a bit dated. not as silly as one would imagine.the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t. but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g.i.s arrival to medieval japan, it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. undoubtedly it's the main order of the day. the whole concept and by extension the movie itself, was probably originated from this simple pitch: what if g.i.'s equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais? and boy does it deliver.the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70's action/war movies. not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length, it's also a terrific mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g.i. samurai can deliver. i mean, where else would you get the chance to feature tanks, ninjas complete with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurais in the same shot? the g.i. platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras, gunning them down with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks.this mish-mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of kurosawa's kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki's samurai banners, while the other is in western action and war movies. there are stylistic touches (like the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g. castellari circa keoma to mind. japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa, and g.i. samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film.the film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it. not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent, it's just that it doesn't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies. the budget was probably hefty, as it is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. the camera-work and editing are all top notch, almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves.it's not withouts its flaws either of course. there are many "song" scenes, where all sorts of 70's japanese rock, disco and country songs play over montages (there's a bonding scene, a love-interest scene, a "war is hell" scene etc). the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing. although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for the most part. still some scenes, flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect.the cast also deserves a mention, featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba, isao natsuyagi (goyokin, samurai wolf), tsunehiko watase (the yakuza papers) and hiroyuki sanada, all of them hitting the right notes.

"gi samurai" sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason, and much carnage ensues. it's a rather over the top essay of sword vs. machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results.the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title; initial fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal box?" etc etc), "aren't we better off here" discussions and ultimately a huge battle. the latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all, the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chiba's platoon; a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance. it's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length.chiba gives a gruff performance as iba, initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him. this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv. by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, as they seem to be asking "weren't we better off back then?'. but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of (almost) non stop action.

pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history. what do you do? well, if you're a hollywood studio, you change the japanese g.i.s in g.i. samurai (aka timeslip) to the crew of an american aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie. but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other. and yes, there are decapitations.of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it. impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version.

i would firstly say that somehow i remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, i couldn't read the subtitles and i thought sonny chiba was sean connery. but i did really like the concept. if you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie. that said, having just watched the restored 137 minute version on dvd i have to say i enjoyed it, though not as much as when i was seven ( i remembered the ending ). there are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments, my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ). for an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll. by the ending of the movie i had decided that this was a good thing, when seven i though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing.for an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action, especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of shogun era warriors. the makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, lets face it, humorous. i thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when i was a kid, and i am not ashamed to say that i still do.i also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum, they've got heavy calibre machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal japan theirs. which is what i'd like to think any vigorous imdb user would do in their boots.in short the movies worth watching, it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like g.i. samurai is so unique.

i just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown away. i won't bother repeating what others have said. what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. the huge battle is exhausting. afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music/songs. blues, country/folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter. it's hideous. you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded.there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. there are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully. i really wish i could erase the music but alas.seek this out. it's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing.

if you are a fan, then you will probably enjoy this. if you don't know who misty mundae, darian caine, ruby larocca, or seduction cinema are, this is not the movie to start out with. it's very cute, silly, the girls are hot, and it's fun to watch. there's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot's not a total bore. misty mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids, so she's not as hot in this as she has been in others. but her panties in this are quite cute (you'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird). if you do like this one, you will probably enjoy "that 70's girl", "vampire vixens", or "erotic survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). if you prefer watching misty or esmerelda in less sexual, more horror/exploitation-based (but lower budget) movies, check out the factory 2000 website.

this movie has great style, fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme.. but all in all, i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it.. big, impressive, powerful, bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty.plot: a guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will (not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer) when he is really mad at you tries to have a girlfriend.. he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand, it's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship....sword boy is on the planet for a reason.. he just doesn't know what it is.. yet.lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively.russain w eng subtitles.. slick worth a watch..

for everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.that's because sasha, like each superhero, takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it. sasha becomes an outlaw. while on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.as you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics. it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma. everything happens very slowly. however, when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's all over. but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action. what is more important here is the outcome of sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. the score is very scarce, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.is the film worth it? that is a question really difficult to answer. i don't think that this experience enriched me so very much, but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope. after all they're young people, who have all their lives to live. so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together.

a woman borough a boy to this world and was alone. they both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm. there was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his body. first he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mom every time. then he grows up and decides to find his real father. just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches the justice....but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right 'cause it is not like in hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - sasha (he is the main hero acted by artem tkachenko) kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs. in such a runaway from authorities and mafia he meets a girl (acted by chulpan hamatova) and falls in love with her. everything else is to be watched...not told. be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions. this film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.

i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, who was made into a monster by society. suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got. but it was a happy surprise. my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole movietheatre laughing) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. so in short: not what i expected, but a very good surprise indeed. i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd.

there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately.a friend, sends me movies now and again, as a surprise, it's awesome.i turned it on and couldn't stop watching, it is a drama, but with a odd twist. imagine if romeo, as in shakepeare, had a super power. it is sad and poetic at the same time. hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story, without a spectacle. this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist. granted it's not perfect, but nothing ever is. you know what the power is but it is never explained, nor totally realized until the end. it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. i don't want to see a remake, it is too cool as is, the hollywood system would, as usual, mess it up. acting is top notch all around. directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there. kudos to all involved,and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic. a+++++if you can find i, watch it.

despite the title, the sword bearer, and the dvd cover (action/herioc poses of the sword bearer) this is not a super hero film.(minor spoilers) it follows the tale of sasha, the sword bearer, who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm. cool you say, but no, this is real life. if you had this power as a child could you control it when, say, faced by a mad man, or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her. and if you don't control it, how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12.this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him. wandering aimlessly after another killing (much like a bout de soufflé). he then meet katya, and the pair fall instantly in love, providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways. however, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers.that is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on screen, though a lot if suggested.i really like this movie. unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films, we get very little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count the sword bearer himself) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development.worth checking out if you can find it.

what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers? the premise may sound familiar. the watchmen? unbreakable? however, the russian sci-fi action flick, the sword bearer, is far from the standard stock.the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society, his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess. when he wishes or his anger allows, a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin. very wolverinish? maybe... but that's not the interesting part of this film. shunned all his life and driven by anger (and a temper he does have) our "hero" returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to. the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground. this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play. this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail. he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about.the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences. this is art house at it's core, beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action. it's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film. the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film. don't worry though, the action is there and plenty of it. however, much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath. this is not to say that action is not shown. these scenes are here and are fantastic (especially the ending where we see sasha's full powers unleashed in desperation). the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand. this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.

"mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i've ever seen. the name of the film can be translated in english as "the sword-bearer". the main hero (sasha) was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand. at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. but it is not about mechenosets. he hardly can be even called the anti-hero. i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good, justice and love. in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him (except his mother). every his step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him. and suddenly he meets her. she doesn't need the idle talks and explanations. she loves him for what he is. she doesn't care what he did. the fact that he's next to her is more important than anything else. but soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before her very eyes. even after that she couldn't escape her feelings. they try to run but it's hart to hide. finally they have a serious car accident. he is caged; she is in a mental hospital. they don't know anything about each other, but she believes that he'll save her. he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her. they run again but they aren't invulnerable. she is wounded, she needs a rest, but police almost catch them. he doesn't know what to do, they drive into a corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, helicopter around them, but there is no need for it, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is the lonely person in the whole world again.

i watched it subtitled as it was in russian, but really enjoyed it. the main character sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. he lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things. when sasha finally found love in a young woman named katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle. there was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomached.not for people who like the regular old hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent films. kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film.

an entertaining kung fu film, with acting, plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky. all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists. alexander fu-sheng's proto-jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch, and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills. for me, the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast -- at times, things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots, and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed-out as one might wish.but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action, and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count. the film climaxes with a high-bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent.overall, shaolin temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie. not up to the quality of a good jet li film, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. my rating: 8/10.misc notes: the 1987 warner home video release i saw was (predictably) poorly dubbed, and lacked full cast & crew credits.

the only kung fu epic worth watching. the best training ever. the main character spending a hundred day's on his knees outside the shaolin temple show how desperate he is to learn kung fu to fight the manchu dogs who have taken over china.

chang cheh's "shaolin temple" might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle. this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who's who of the shaw stable. though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual, it is cheh's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable. the sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame. not unlike william keighley's paean to the fabled fighting 69th in that same self titled film or john ford's salute to west point in "the long gray line," cheh's "shaolin temple" is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style.the cultural correlation i am tempted to make, is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo. watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the alamo. at the end of the film, you too might be tempted to call out, remember the shaolin temple!

this was one of the best movies i have seen. the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part. although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, i found it to be exhilarating to watch.some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction. however, when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters, there is no direction is life. i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations.most of the cast are newcomers to the industry. however, they all pulled it off very well. everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately.i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control. this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways.

this movie is really not all that bad. but then again, this movie genre is right down my alley. sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did decent with what they had. if you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic b movies, then you'll love this one!! i sure did!

i watched the movie while recovering from major surgery. while i knew it was only a "b" film, a space western, i loved it. it may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non-the-less held my imagination and provided great escapism. sadly our society has so much available, discounting small attempts is too easy. in the same way that i can enjoy a even a grade school performance of shakespeare, i can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake. i am a cop and found affinity with the retired lapd. dreams like his haunt me that i will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another's life (or my own). while it was a romantic ending where farnsworth did take out the bad guy (predictable) i needed a little happy romance where good can triumph. my world is really too cynical.

the question is, can a movie this entertaining really be considered a "bad" movie? my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words "vestron pictures" on it (vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films "suburbia" and "class of 1984"). we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was. your basic plot as is follows: grange, this goombaesque thug from planet earth, robs "the bank of the moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (i don't even remember the planet's name) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. the "governor" of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor. walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the whole planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with. then there's the nameless "colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare. much of the movie centers around "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides) with explosions galore. the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet, ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts. but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid-80s. i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. i can't even remember the names of the bands (they're listed in the credits) other than exploding white mice, because that was the only one i'd heard of before i saw this movie, but i'm definitely looking into them.basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.

one of the better kung fu movies, but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews. the movie starts out well enough, with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you'd think for this era) and make the non-fight dialogue sequences passable (for a kung fu movie, this is a great compliment). unlike other chinese action movies, which were always period pieces or (in the wake of jackie chan's police story i) cop dramas, pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china. unfortunately, in the latter 1/3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary.the action is overall good, featuring a duel between sammo and 1/2 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars, kar-leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy. there's only 20 minutes of combat here, which is standard, but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames. i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth edits and then there's this. it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with.that said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here won't dissuade you, and if you don't, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this.

this is one of the best hong kong (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes. this sammo film has it all, romance, drama, excitement and a great hero as well. it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights. sammo fans- this is a must see (see also eastern condors, shanghai express (yuen biao is ace!), dragons forever and enter the fat dragon.

to be honest, i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it. that's how i watch movies whenever possible. no preconception. i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something. i was wrong, kinda.loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me. i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do.another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ. these kinds of things do happen. i'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible". really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen. the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices. sometimes things turn out good, sometimes they turn out bad and such is life.i highly recommend this movie.

this is one excellent sammo hung movie. actually, this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema. the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w/ a vicious pimp. the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined. the story is involving and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes. sammo hung proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business. the action is simply amazing, esp. the fight w/ lau kar leung and the finale. billy chow and sammo hung are amazing. a must see for any fan of action.

what can i add that the previous comments haven't already said. this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed!! there are moments of genius throughout this movie, if you can, see it now! thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago!

sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything. great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos.this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat. sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino, sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in.some great and touching moments in the film, lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted.the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button, as its one of the best end fights i've seen. sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow.

sammo hung's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece. i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has. it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry.sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century, i think. they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. sammo is interested in local baker girl ping (nina li chi) while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit-ying he falls madly in love with. many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong! soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created. as well as some nice drama.the film has a great cast. the leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and "humor" as in sammo's otherwise great eastern condors (1987), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2, ninja in the dragon's den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2), the masterful composer lowell lo koon-ting (john woo's the killer and ringo lam's school on fire and prison on fire among many others, pedicab driver included!), the shaw veteran liu chia liang (whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks), alfred cheung kin-ting (the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988), the late great lam ching ying (best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror/kung fu/comedies) to name just a few. in fact, the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i've seen in any other hk production.the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo's character. they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past or what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner. also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. still i think what fennie says to max (about the future "bad cooking") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately.but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. the fight scenes include traditional kung fu, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i've seen in any film ever, jackie chan's drunken master ii (1994), they really are that great! there are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched. simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver. also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his/her breath as the film has one fast car vs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. still the film makers seem not to "accept" the violence of the film as sammo is, like the late bruce lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and i think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious or shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment.the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america (for example) would understand or like at all. the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing. also some funny scenes are created out of sammo's passion for ping. still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course.pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo's greatest achievements. if the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. 8/10

this, "prodigal son" and "eastern condors" are my favourite sammo hung films. the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in "condors", but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor. he is, in fact, at the top of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story also. love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action, and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes.the opening scene, which features a funny light sabre duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. a sequence in which sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone. the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction, and easily one of the best ever of its type. the film's violence escalates slowly until, finally, when the climactic showdown comes, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production. the director/actor's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made.great score, too.

i've seen this movie on several different occasions. i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it.type 1: old people. a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest-to-goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue. as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences, the old people walk out, usually disgusted.type 2: film snobs. these people think that just because a movie bears the label of "independent" that it will automatically be a load of hard-to-follow, overemotional crap that may or may not be in english. yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured. they are really in for a surprise when they see this film. as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the over-the-top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation, these people will be so dismayed, they will walk out. a few will stay just to see "how bad it will get" and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.type 3: people expecting to see live-action anime or matrix-like special effects. sorry folks, the martial arts are pretty solid in the film, but director yamasato really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing.type 4: people with no expectations. these are the people who really enjoy the film. whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai, picked it at random, or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is: entertainment. this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought, it was meant (if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film) to "really kick some ass." and that's what it does.so depending on what type of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this film; however, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends.

this movie for what it is, may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day. made on a super small budget, the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films! if you have a chance watch it!

this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy b movie. it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go, "hmmmmm... that's so stupid!" and then have you laughing. for example, there is a scene back in "16th century japan", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. in the background of the temple, there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts. hmmmm... hahahah! i could not stop laughing. and the acting goes from decent, to bearable, to oh my lord, but that's what makes it funny. you'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome. her air time in the film was pretty short though. i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie. anyhow, it's an entertaining film, if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening.

yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.i thought the movie was ok...nothing really outstanding...i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.ahh, but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion.no...the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. after all, who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school? ah, the poor little rich kids...in their quaint pretty house, with their ivy league schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will the world do without them? i hope they all get addicted to drugs, pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.

i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival. wow! blood just blew us away with its sheer verve, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, utter campiness, and even more gore, and all in such great fun! especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films, you definitely have to see blood!

maybe i need to have my head examined,but i thought this was a pretty good movie.the cg is not too bad.i have seen worse.the look of the creatures(and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake)was pretty cool.the action scenes involving the snakes was really good,i thought.there are some lapses in logic at times,and the story doesn't always make sense.but for a creature feature,there are a lot worse.a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies,so it's not wholly original.i think the gist of the story is original though.there is a bit of similarity to godzilla(the big budget american version)which liked a lot.i didn't like this movie as much,but i still say it was pretty good.i also liked the music.all in all,i think dragon wars is about a 7/10

if you like sci-fi, monsters, and ancient legends, then you will love this movie!! the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago. while the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects adequately compensated for it.i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv.if you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....you have to see this movie!!

i have never seen such a movie before. i was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie. i never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny. the story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them. i have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it i think its worth watching. i give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created, this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash. i mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like "the camera is in front of them". you will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is, me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie, the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh!# although he doesn't speak english lol. if you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this. this movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie defines lame. the evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous, the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time. the evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want. the transition between scenes leaves you wondering did i miss something? so many plot holes from scene to scene. i was laughing like crazy when they decided to "escape to mexico" to get away from the serpent. hmmmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from korea? interesting... very interesting.... i guess hopping the border solves all problems. another scene that completely stupified me.. they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other... the scene was so clichéd and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they just met even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing. anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light. bad hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this. in the end its worth watching you wont get bored you will be occupied criticizing every moment, every scene in your head.

i enjoyed this movie and i had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews i read before going. i went because i was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the koreans. oh and it's from korea which has put out some of my favorite movies. i liked host but not my absolute favorite. some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste: mirrormask, stardust, serenity, gattaca, willow, matrix, resident evil series, lotr, stargate, dark city.it wasn't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great. there are some holes in the story but didn't really matter. i sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when i see summer blockbusters. the korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation stuff was different, and i thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like korean actors in other shows. ethan's(behr)hair looked so asian.yes, it could be better and i hope in the future that korea, with its unusual quirky sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre. maybe a combination of host and dragon wars in the future?

yes, some people have said that this movie was a waste of money, but i'm the kind of die hard dragon/world-ending/holy crap action movie fan.but if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good. but its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time, or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time. though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me.the 3d graphics were pretty damn good. i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were great!!!! big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had. the fight between good and evil at the end was, i have to to say could have been longer and slightly better, it was still pretty good.now on to the parts that i think could have been better. the beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles. i mean if you don't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a dvder...overall i loved the movie,but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well.

i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august, though the movie was not released in the us, at least, until the middle of september. maybe these are unhappy expats living in s. korea who saw it early. i am in the us and just saw it today. i thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. the story was non-western, but i think we are all used to this from many other movies. it wasn't at all hard to follow. the acting by the leads was weak, but other people were quite good. there was humor throughout, too. i rated it at 8 because i had a good time watching it, which is what i went for.

if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated, you'll enjoy d-war. if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films, you'll enjoy d-war. otherwise, don't bother! i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. they really loved it and that made me feel good. after the movie was over, all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater.the cg is good. acting and directing are horrible. storyline is extremely simple. but, since the half of the audience was kids, they were screaming, shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen. this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been.it's a good movie to take your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, d-war is disappointing. i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much.

generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons. i especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie. however, i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell. for instance- what happened to tristan's brother, hayden? for all we know he died in the hospital. maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! who knows! maybe there will be a sequel? maybe? if there is.. i cant wait to see it.

dead to rights is about a police officer named jack slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him.jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.several months later on the day jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder.jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead.through out the game jack uses weapons from m4 carbines to his dog shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels.the game play is basically "kill 30 people,find switch to open door.kill 50 people,find switch to open door" over and over until the level is done.there are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a night club so jack can get to another area in the club,or bomb disarming.dead to rights is also a hard game.you will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with sub machine guns while you only have a pistol.near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.dead to rights is as gory as it is hard.if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls,ceiling and floor.and since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.family fun for everyone.

this is no art-house film, it's mainstream entertainment. lot's of beautiful people, t&a, and action. i found it very entertaining. it's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun film to watch! jesse and chace are funny too, which is just gravy. definitely worth a rental.so in summary, i'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!)the villains are good too. vinnie, corey large, the hatian guy from heroes. very nasty villains.

i've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne, when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade-like game with a desire to rip-off the max payne style (not just bullet-time). so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is! and how different from "max payne", yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game-style. this game is non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up, so much fun, as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a bit more of that "bullet-time" you should definitely own this game.

once again, i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap (i mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. this movie is much better than i expected. i found it very engaging, though it was obviously made by an amateur. the direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good thrills. i expected it to be more of a comedy, but i wasn't too disappointed. for a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. there's no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. usually, these movies require all four of those elements. the pg rating is well-deserved--not like "sixteen candles" where the "f" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene. i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more. the film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side. instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. they end up kissing at the end, but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced."the dream machine" is no gem, but it's good, clean entertainment. it's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect. my score: 7 (out of 10)

there have been far too few mainstream films set in post-colonial africa, and the ones that have are a mixed bunch. this one, with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values of africa, which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole. it also has shortcomings, given the undue influence of western pre-conceptions of africans and, especially, arabs.dr anansa linderby, the beautiful african-american wife of the english doctor david linderby, is captured by arab slave-traders, along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy. the lead slave-trader, suleiman, is every bit the stage arab, with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric, and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on "carry on follow that camel" but are not up the standard this film deserves. peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script, and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one-dimensional character.continuing the stereotypical theme, all three of suleiman's arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy, which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen.one of david's first ports of call is the local police officer, a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat. david then meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an englishman (walker, played by rex harrison) and an american (sandell, played by william holden). sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views on mixed-race relationships, who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front. won over by david's love for anansa, and conscious of his own inability to find love, he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa. they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory - as a result of sandell's hesitation and david's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down but david survives.we then see david introduced to malik (kabir bedi), an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance. they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman.in one of the most heart-rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman's group, and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier.later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and, in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman's henchmen. anansa on her part - and despite the scepticism of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of suleiman's two other employees.by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market.suleiman, now in no doubt that anansa is "trouble", attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince (omar sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u.n., the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences. the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film.at the slave market, the young boy is sold to a middle-aged german paedophile, and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered "wunderbar" when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch-doctoring skills.david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter-sweet ending from malik's point of view.ultimately, david and anansa are re-united, and malik, whose life is in ruins, can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed.the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters. credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting.

ashanti is a very 70s sort of film (1979, to be precise). it reminded me of the wild geese in a way (richard burton, richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa). it's a very good film too, and i enjoyed it a lot.david (michael caine) is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa (beverley johnson) who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor. while they're doctoring, one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman (played perfectly by peter ustinov, of all people). the rest of the film is david trying to get her back.michael caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back, but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff. he's helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on (rex harrison!), then briefly by a helicopter pilot (william holden), and then by an arab called malik (kabir bedi). malik has a score to settle with suleiman (he is very intense throughout, a very engaging character), and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camel.then there's lots of adventure. there's also lots of morality-questioning. the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point, and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster, but it's all pretty forgivable. the question is, will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif (yes, of course omar sharif is in it!)?

let's think people , quit bad-mouthing the original , for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and art . lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck , but i dare say , not as pretty as katee as starbuck . i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar , war of the gods , the best was experiment in terra , i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait , then you had the women of battlestar , not to compare them to let's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six , but jane seymour's beauty could not be compared to . let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic .she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . i loved the original as much as the new .can you imagine if john calicos had a number six ? :)thankyou for listening .

this movie is pretty good. half a year ago, i bought it on dvd. but first i thought that it was the original film. i have seen the series and it is a good film, but here, they have put "the living legend,part1 and 2",and "fire in space" together. the same as they did with the first film, but with other episodes. but still, it is a pretty good film. only the ending is strange (you don't see what happens with the pegasus). but i still think that it is pretty good. the actors and special effects were good. if you haven't seen it, go see it. starring:richard hatch, dirk benedict, lorne greene, herb. jefferson jr., tony swartz, terry carter, lloyd bridges, jack stauffer.

although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows: "fire in space" and "living legend", if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out. i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. i would say if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video versions on vhs. they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now. another good video is conquest for the earth, which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves. overall, i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers.

as i said in my comment about the first part: these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess.the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.but when battlestar pegasus appears, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the cylon planets. okay, it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth, but it works for me. it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-) ).i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board. instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...so thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.

found this flick in a videostore, it cost $2 to buy. the whole movie stinks really bad! the so-called colonel, who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted, must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk. he nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense given the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning, a now two terrifyingly eighties-looking guys take over, in what must have been some sort of story. i got lost a hundred times but didn't mind, because the movie is so bad, it's real fun to watch. zero-budget trash with actors not deserving that name. go check it out!

hey people, what's up. it's me man, the one and only mike "sonny sakura killer" kelly. you know........ you can't really write a review on the script of sakura, cause there we didn't have one. as far as i know, the story was just made up as we went along. i had the best time of my life making that film, and got so much stank that i ran out of jism...........fun times. so glad that you all enjoyed the film. i really didn't get to do the fights that i had envisioned. every time i set up some moves, the fight director kept changing them. still, i had a blast and met some really great people. especially the purple female ninja who has seem to fall of the film-making scene.

it's hard to rate films like this, because do you rate it on production or just fun?i saw this film back in about 1988/89 or so when i was a boy and i'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas. the plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible, but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere. what is important are the fight scenes, while a 'little' sparce, are really good.i must say it was better when i was a boy, only now can i see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film, but as a "sit back with a few beers" martial arts film i can't fault it, it delivers and is much better than the mountains of "american ninja" style rubbish that was churned out in the 80's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes.in an interesting note, dusty nelson, the writer and director of sakura killers did another ninja film under the bonaire movie flag called "white phantom" i have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to sakura killers" but the sakura clan is once again a main feature, including the same logo and similar story only this time including a white ninja. this too, while being mostly dire, had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more sparce and to be frank, are pretty awful.so, if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours!

don't listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this film.....simply put, as regards ninja movies, this my friends is about as good as it gets! yes it's silly, yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious, but by gum - it's so much bloody fun! in fact, as is often the case with b-movies, the horrendous 'acting' (which in the case of the movie in question, is truly amongst the worst i have ever had the joy to behold!) and ridiculous 'plot' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold.obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part i'm pleased to say, they're very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity....) trust me on this, if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen sakura killers, then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion, one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre.

for those of you that don't that reference, clubberin was 4 fists hitting one body...anyways, onto the review.i miss wcw saturday night. some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage. i remember watching stunning steve austin, rick rude, brian pillman, cactus jack, dustin rhodes, johnny b. badd, ddp in his jobber days, lord steven regal, harlem heat, ricky steamboat, sting...i'd be here a while listing everyone. point is wcw had an awesome roster in the pre hogan days and they were producing entertaining television. dusty rhodes on commentary in it's later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when i started smoking pot as a teenager...i really wish vince would put him on the mic for a show or two, maybe at the next great american bash? they clubberin! here comes da plunda! he was great.-dirrty

this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons. the co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments. robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where williamson says to ginty, "you sure do get around buddy boy!". i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson, but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely. a film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so. it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look. the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent, so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing.

white fire has so much going for it. with larry bird look-alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache, the movie soars above other low-budget actioners. the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz. with ginty beating up everyone, the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play. then add in fred williamson, some frontal bush, chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes....this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders. if you're looking for some awesome b-action, this is where it's at. now, if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack.

white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs. he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made. i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad, but i made an exception for this one... and i was very glad that i did.it's filled to the brim with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically gory), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a key female character, but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious) and outrageously awkward dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film.ginty, the unusual looking star of the exterminator (and countless other low budget action turds) is amusing in the lead, giving the best performance he could muster. williamson is better than usual, clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee (and he doesn't come in until midway through). the rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish-mash of spanish and italian. she's priceless.again, i can't stress enough how gory it was. it's not so bloody that it's nauseating, but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget. also, when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys, he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers.don't miss white fire. it's a rollicking - if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic.

superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray! the pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes? well, bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all. sick, dude! anyway, as kids they fled from russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. a friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers. when the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine. very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of "white fire", but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause (and i bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i won't reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes. bo's principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, there's the obligatory "we're-falling-in-love" montage and loads of other attractions! my god, what a brilliant experience. the original french title translates itself as "life to survive", which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: none!

what can you say about the film white fire. amazing? fantastic? disturbing? hilarious? these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire. from wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout.our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. when the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch. father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit, and is polite as he gets people's attention before he shoots them, but alas, dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre "halt!", and then promptly wastes the mother. this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred.so now we fast forward about 20 years (30 if you're honest about the hero's age) to beautiful turkey, where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves, or diamond prospectors, or something. ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods, while bo (masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship. they don't seem to have any friends other than each other, and they spend all of their time together. that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as "you know its a shame you're my sister" he says to her while she's stark naked, make for a very dynamic duo. bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid. this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas, and he is overjoyed with his new love.so anyway, there's a lot of fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow plot-lines, fred "the hammer" williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). all of these things are great, but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire. you may be glad you did..or not.

absolutely fantastic trash....this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions etc. it also stars the wonderful belinda mayne as ingrid - not olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although olga turns into ingrid later on in the film (you'll have to watch it to see what i mean).i won't bother to go into the story as it's far too long winded and not very interesting. the relationship between ingrid and her brother bo (robert ginty) is interesting - watch the towel stealing scene to see what i mean.the fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did city of the walking dead (i.e. strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds).i'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though and i couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re-release it so it'll become all the rarer in a few years.anyway i'd recommend it solely for belinda mayne's great nude scenes! that lady's a fox!

a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed (by accident) the warriors father (or whoever he was). and they travel through the nature of africa's most ruff areas.the acting in this movie isn't that good (except for that elephant kid). but it's a very good adventure and it's not very censored, there is some blood, flesh and nudity (which lighten up the movie a bit).i give this movie a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action.

i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb. it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb. at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it. huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them. all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film. but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film. it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all.

i had seen this movie when it got released, and when i was 12 years old :) and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :) and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! i think many so-called action movies copied a lot many "escape scenes" from this movie!! and not only does it never impress me when i see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) the lead actors have acted wonderfully. the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. as children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural :) the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance!! --vijay.

i liked this movie very much. although this movie doesn't boast of big (or even known) names, its very charming. its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end. my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part. i rate this movie at 7.5

deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser. in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.technically superb horror comedy(?) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but lets just say its pretty gruesome. if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film. personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level. here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies.. its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on-as revealed in the end-i want to go back and see what it was i didn't catch on to. there is an internal logic rare in these films.7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs, its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else.

some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous, but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them, this is also a film a film of an acquired taste! my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the thing' i.e the parasitical aliens from outta space, infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible!you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre, however cleverly maintains its own originality, well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival! only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host! to then pick another fight with another infected host! and this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away.great! but like i said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the film. it is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty, with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons, i.e saws, drills, blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent. i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next!so if you like gore, you like aliens, you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere, then i must recommend this film as a must see. i just wish i came across this earlier then i did!

why aren't more films (especially american) more like meatball machine? this is my first official on-line review and i am charged with "electrical ecstasy" after having chosen "meatball machine" as my first endeavor. this is a review, so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion.i mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo! so what if it's not all original? i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. meatball machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. thank you jesus for japanese cinema!simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so. i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. this time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring.in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! there's more!!! fight scenes!! great music!! great point-of-view shots! decent acting by the woman cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times.oh, and did i forget to mention it's a love story! wow, i hate love stories but this takes the cake!i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. sadly, i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine. the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine.lastly, my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. normally she says something like "why are you watching that junk?" this time she had nothing to say. i was glad! this is not junk. this isn't just splatter (splatter for the sake of splatter is also great). this is art my friends. art.chacho

for fans of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you! there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film, also the effects can be impressionable and awesome. the plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days.also notable are the little aliens, who i found cute. all in all, it's a good film for fans of the genre. also recommended are films such as tetsuo:the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach, filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed. of course, seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two.

most of the feedback i've heard concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed. a couple even saying that they think "it sucked". well, to those people i say, get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself. this was a very entertaining flick.the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gwar-costume looking, deathbots called necroborgs. eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you, which then is able to control your actions due to hot-wiring your nervous system. unfortunately for two love-seeking lonely young adults, they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug, and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered. is there a way to stop the transformation? maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? why do the necroborgs fight one another? do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty? only one way to find out.going into meatball machine i was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions, but it turned out being a great surprise. a few unanswered questions, some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of. from the anime feel to it, to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel, this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses. with a ever-developing story that's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make-up effects and blood splatter, this is one flick fans of bizarro/horror/tetsuo/splatter fans should check out. 8 outta 10

wow baby, this is indeed some fine asian horror/gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and guts, there is a bizarre love story. it's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs. the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human, is they need to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that, with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun. the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's "the thing" in creature design and effects. i would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds, as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore. and a must-have for stoners, because you don't even need to read the sub-titles, the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip. the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter's movies, which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour. "meatball machine" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and i simply loved it.

don't be fooled by the silly title folks, this is one sweet ride! a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer, this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll. it seems that aliens are taking over people's bodies and modifying them into war-machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species. the winner of the battle eats the loser alive. that's mostly it for plot, but who cares when the gore is this good? i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used, but it's disgusting to behold. there is interesting and effective use of stop-motion when the takeovers are in progress, and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make-up effects. the cgi is a bit limited, but that actually doesn't detract from the overall quality one bit, at least for me. this was truly a fun and stomach-turning film that deserves much praise, and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics. find it and watch, you won't be disappointed!

the japanese cyber-punk films have never really done a whole lot for me, but of the handful that i've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. meatball machine is no exception.the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts, takes control of their bodies, turns them into "necroborgs", and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of said parasites. the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other, but whose love-affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites, and are forced to fight each other. it becomes a test of human-will vs. the parasite's control over their physical bodies...meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo (as most cyber-punk films are), and for good reason. there are definitely some thematic parallels, though the films are definitely different. there's plenty of fun, splattery moments in meatball machine, and the creature/borg fx are definitely the high-point - a mixture of tetsuo-meets-gwar that are both elaborate and inventive. depending on your taste for these types of films, meatball machine may or may not be your thing. if you enjoy hyper-kinetic cyber-punk films with a healthy dose of splatter - this one's for you...7/10

meatball machine is an amazing splatter film, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood, and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines.now the film isn't for everyone, people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo: the iron man will applaud it.the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film, but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously.yet, all in all it's a lot of fun, well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles.

i don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of " tetsuo " or not . why " tetsuo " ? because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious " tetsuo " rip - off . the concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors .there is lot more gore , less eroticism and , in the case of " meatball machine " , the transformation of human being into a creature that's partially a machine( sounds familiar ? ) called " necroborg " ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens .these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . they infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs . their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eat it .all in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn't expect much , but at the end i actually enjoyed this film .as i said before , this is a low budget flick , but it's still relatively decent . don't expect much from actors , they're mostly not very good , but it can be tolerated . i liked the atmosphere and gore , certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . although the story is not too original , it possesses certain charm - to me at least .7 out of 10 .

directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi (battlefield baseball) and jun'ichi yamamoto "meatball machine" is apparently a remake of yamamoto's 1999 movie with the same name. i doubt i'll ever get a chance to see the original so i'll just stick commenting on this one. first of what is "meatball machine" ? a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. it's not something you'll end up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema."meatball machine" follows the well known plot. boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. boy finally meets girl. girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save his love. will he succeed? who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death i'm satisfied.the plot is simple, relatively clichéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. and yes it too luckily shows more violence. i'm happy. acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. it's not exactly painful for the ears but it's not exactly good either.the movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like i haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. done by keita amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. the necroborgs as they are called in "meatball machine" look stunningly detailed. without the usage of cgi amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are a-movie class."meatball machine" is "tetsuo the iron man" mixed up with "alien" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. it's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.

i love this anime! i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence (mostly from akane ranma's reluctant but short tempered "fiancee")is so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends...clumsily. the main character ranma goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water. from then on it's pure chaos one after another. among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi, the sexy shampoo, the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our hero/heroine. however it is ranma's selfish father genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time. if anyone want an anime that's funny, this is the one. it's cuter and better with the japanese dub.

so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, with very few shows i simply will not watch.this show, however, i would recommend to anyone.quite possibly the most original series to date, it;s got just about everything i could ask for. a side story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to, a very blatant comedy, and a very well put together voice acting cast (both japanese and american translation).if not for the terribly funny aspect to it, it would be, just another anime.more or less, as i have noticed, a 'love it or hate it', very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it.original to the core, with everything you could ask for in an afternoon, bet the house on this series. i'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.

wow... i mean wow this has got to be one of the best story's i've ever had the chance to read/watch. we all know this famous story. two martial artist, a man and his son, go to train in the forbidden cursed springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. the dad, genma, the spring of drowned panda. and 16 year old ranma, the spring of drowned girl. now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. crazy enough yet? no, thats just the beginning. as if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn't enough, ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for "stealling" their loved ones. and speaking of loved ones, i've lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with ranma. and not once has it been his fiancée, akane. and thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series.the story itself is amazing. i have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so... so... out of this world and yet its so down to earth and believable... i can't even describe it to its fullest. its just a charming story thats so easy to get into. what i like about it is the humor. not once have i laughed out loud this much from a manga, and it doesn't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in simpson's or something of the sort. i could read any part of the comic and i would be laughing from beginning to end. another thing is the characters. ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo... with every little problem the story throws at him he's doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius. and to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town, more so by akane, the worst pervert to ever live. his father genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? correct! but whenever he does have some spotlight... he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! you think you know the worst dad ever from an anime? you haven't met genma. ryoga, probably one of ranma's greatest rivals and my favorite character (next to ranma)... and probably one of the only people he can actually stand. most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault... is his lack of sense in direction! then we have... you know, i could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story's, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless.check out the series if you haven't, now! you will not regret it! though i would advise checking the comic out first. i like the anime, but i've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. and a small nitpick, the humor doesn't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. i think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. but either way, its a win win! 10 out of 10!

admittedly, i first picked up ranma 1/2 when i was around twelve. i was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read. then, i went to the comic/manga section and spotted this book. at my first few reads through the chapters i didn't really know what was going on, but i knew that i loved it. i even took it home for a few more reads over. frankly, i wasn't getting anywhere. and then, about five months (i'm 16 now) ago my friend was watching some anime series and i remembered about this manga. i couldn't remember what it was called, but recalled that the author was rumiko takahashi, creator of inu yasha. i googled it, and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes. at first i was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics, but it didn't really matter in the end. no anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind, watch again. i once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day. i don't know how i did it... but i couldn't stop. eventually, after about two days, i grew obsessed. i even dreamt--as crazy as this sounds--about watching ranma. never have i found a series so enjoyable, so funny, and so heartwarming to watch. to this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied. of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers, but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading. ranma 1/2 is about a boy named ranma saotome and his dad genma saotome. intense martial artists. they are so intense, that they went to the ancient training grounds in china and became 'cursed'. the grounds were full of different pools of springs, and if you land in one, you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water. for genma, that was a panda, and for ranma that was a... girl! it's a very crafty fun loving story. on top of that, genma promises his friend that ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the tendo dojo alive. 'course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual. obviously they start to like one another, but both way to stubborn to admit it. but.. genma has a history of doing this. he promised ranma to many girls. trust me. it's worth watching. it's humorous, heartwarming and all around amazing.

''ranma ½" is my favorite anime by rumiko takahashi. the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, that is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. the main character of the story is ranma saotome, a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. ranma is engaged to akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained together during many years. akane is the younger and most violent sister of the tendo's: kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.ranma and akane fight all the time,specially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda,many new characters and situations starts to happen. they also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting, ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. but not only them had this kind of fate...if you watched ''ranma 1/2'' and liked, i would recommend you ''inuyasha'' and ''maison ikkoku", two other good creations from rumiko's hands.

first things first, edison chen did a fantastic, believable job as a cambodian hit-man, born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring, where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive, living on the mantra of kill or be killed. in a role that had little dialogue, or at least a few lines in cambodian/thai, his performance is compelling, probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog, where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting, and on someone else's leash.like danny the dog, the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically, but rather designed as normal, brutal fisticuffs, where everything goes. this probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats, in defending their own lives while taking it away from others. it's a grim, gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively, and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production.edison plays a hired gun from cambodia, who becomes a fugitive in hong kong, on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry. leading the chase is the team led by cheung siu-fai, who has to contend with maverick member inspector ti (sam lee), who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father. so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of hong kong.the story itself works on multiple levels, especially in the character studies of the hit-man, and the cop. on opposite sides of the law, we see within each character not the black and white, but the shades of grey. with the hit-man, we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (pei pei), bringing about a sense of maturity, tenderness, and revealing a heart of gold. the cop, with questionable tactics and attitudes, makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. there are many interesting moments of moral questioning, on how anti-hero, despicable strategies are adopted. you'll ask, what makes a man, and what makes a beast, and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us, transforming from man to dog, and dog to man? dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end, though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag, especially on its tender moments, and it suffered too from not knowing when to end. if i should pick a favourite scene, then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered, a suspenseful edge of your seat moment. listen out for the musical score too, and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs.highly recommended, especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre.

first of all that i would like to say is that edison chen is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd! this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian. the cambodian(edison aka pang) goes around killing people to survive himself; has done it throughout his entire life. sam lee's(wai) duty is to capture the cambodian for good. there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it. the movie shows the struggles between those two characters; they both beat each other like angry dogs. go and watch ppl...strongly suggessted!!! (go hk films)

this has got to be the best movie i've ever seen.combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot, and you have a masterpiece.dog bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes, recoiling in horror during others, and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending.the film left a deep impression on me. it's shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender 'love' scenes. the film is undeserving of it's cat iii (nudity) rating; there are no nude scenes whatsoever, and the 'love' scenes do not even involve kissing or 'making out'.the message which this film presented to me? all human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a tender side. edison chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous pang.i rate this film 10/10. it's a must-watch.

dog bite dog isn't going to be for everyone, but i really enjoyed it. full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but don't worry  the lead's a terrible shot), it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia. edison cheng plays pang, a cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister. despite being filthy from his journey, he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. if this sounds wildly implausible to you, you should probably avoid this film. it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief, and i had a lot more fun for it.chasing pang down is wai (sam lee), a young, edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke. wai walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him, and his father, a legendary good cop, is in a coma following a drug deal that went south (the implication is that wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings).there are a car crashes, lots of killings, and a strange and awkward love story on offer here, all played out in almost comic-book style. i suspect the humour was deliberate (nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd), though the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members. there are at least three points where the film might have ended, and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing, or the deletion of one of the narrative threads (the light-hearted stuff worked well, so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathers).i'm inclined to give it a (high) pass, however, if only because of the ending  i've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment. this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous

ultra-grim crime drama from pou-soi cheang, the director of "home sweet home". tonally, it reminded me of billy tang's "run and kill", although it's not as polished as that. nevertheless, it's an engaging, flawed bit of mayhem about a cambodian loner, pang (edison chen), who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer. while fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop sam wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. there must be something in the air lately because i've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately. this is grim, nasty stuff, which is why i'm so partial to it, and i applaud its downbeat vibe. it's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain. a subplot involving pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery.

i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track (in english). it seems in cambodia (the subtitles in english say the character is speaking thai but the movie says cambodia)a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill. he sends pang to kill some people in china and during the killings a cop's partner is killed. the cop wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma. wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about wai's erratic behavior. he doesn't know wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma. pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave (pang doesn't speak chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii). wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting pang but pang is almost unstoppable. even after pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant wai follows and joins the evil man (who's training the boys)making a deal to fight and train so he can get pang. there is a big showdown between wai and pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving wai dead and pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer. this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. there are many very brutal violent scenes. the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot. knives to the neck and torso. guns fired directly to the head. and several very intense beatings. it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing.

some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this film from pou-soi cheang isn't really sleazy, lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. however, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard-edged action is your thing.edison chen plays pang, a cambodian hit-man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge; sam lee is wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down, whatever the cost. with wai closing in on his target, pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances from chen and lee (as well as newcomer pei pei as pang's love interest), dog bite dog is one for fans of hard-hitting asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of chan-wook park's vengeance trilogy). stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang.of course, this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this film dies (rather nasty deaths). unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, dog bite dog crosses it: in a laughably over-dramatic final scene, pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on. eventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on (a now dead) yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of hong kong excess, with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals, it's still worth seeking out.

as i understand it, after the chinese took over hong kong, the infamous cat. 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared. at least until now, and what an amazing movie this one is. i knew it was a rough crime drama going in, but being the first cat. 3 i've purchased that's been made recently, i wasn't sure what to expect.a cambodian hit-man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge, who is also a lawyer. turns out, the judge made the arrangements for the hit-man, because she was divorcing the judge, and threatening to take all his money. this is all known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is being given away. after the hit, the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast, but in trying to arrest him, several police officers and civilians are killed. he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy, before he escapes back to cambodia. this is a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath. yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed, as the hit-man proves very very hard to track, and take down when they do locate him. along the way, the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump, finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man. he helps her, and saves her from the guy, and she persuades the hit-man to take her along with him in his escape. i loved this movie, it's like a roller-coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed, as one incident leads to another, and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man. the acting is exceptionally good, and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking. there's no let up in this movie, not even with the very very incredible ending. the ending is pretty much unbelievable, and also a fitting end to all the action and violence. yes, the violence is brutal at times, but this is a very no nonsense crime drama, that will knock your socks off. "dog eat dog" definitely needs a more widespread release, including an r1 release for sure. great movie, highly recommended.

despite being quite far removed from my expectations, i was thoroughly impressed by dog bite dog. i rented it not knowing much about it, but i essentially expected it to be a martial arts/action film in the standard hong kong action tradition, of which i am a devoted fan. i ended up getting something entirely different, which is not at all a bad thing. while the film could be classified as such, and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film, it is definitely not the primary focus. its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights, a rather uncommon thing in many hong kong action movies.i was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film. the lead character, played by edison chen (who is really very good), becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than i ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes. the police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly. in fact, the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film. i don't know that i would say dog bite dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal, good cop, but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film (unfortunately). so many films, especially hong kong action films i find, portray police in what is frankly a very ignorantly idealized light. this is one of my least favorite things about the genre. i was pleasantly surprised to see that dog bite dog actually had some very unique, and really quite courageous, ideas to present about the police force. there are negotiation scenes in this film that i have never seen the likes of before, and doubt i will ever see again, and am sure i will remember for quite a while. also, the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well, there is some documentary footage in the film of cambodian boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands, which i thought was one of the film's most powerful and moving moments. it says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are, rather than simply condemning them. also, the relationship between chen's character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character. it wasn't until this element entered the film that i really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one. there is something about most on screen relationships that doesn't quite get through to me, but for some reason this one really did. the actress does an incredible job with this role which i imagine was not easy to play.dog bite dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography, all though it is unfortunately rather uneven. there were some moments that i found really striking, particularly in the last segment of the film, but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just ok. another slight problem i had was with the pacing, which i also felt was uneven. i found a lot of the "looking for a boat" scenes to be a little alienating, all though it quickly picks up after that. the action scenes are short and not too plentiful, but are truly powerful and effecting, particularly towards the end. the fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part, all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic, but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights. the final scene, while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography, is one of the most powerful final fights i have ever seen, and i've seen quite a few martial arts films.i suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of dog bite dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters. all of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind, but there was something very human about all of them that i couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them, particularly chen's girlfriend. i should say that i doubt most people will like the film as much as i did simply because i imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way, but i still recommend it highly all the same. it is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance.

i gotta be straight-up - i haven't seen a film as solid as dog bite dog in quite a while. i'm a big fan of the "old-school" late 80s to mid 90s era catiii films, and i had been hearing that that "style" of films is making a bit of a come-back with films such as this, and herman yau's gong tau (which as of this writing i have not yet seen...), so i was very interested to give some of these newer-wave catiii films a shot. did this film live up to my expectations? absolutely - but not quite in the fashion that i imagined.the story follows a young, animalistic, resourceful and virtually unstoppable thai hit-man with a somewhat vague history who comes to hong kong to complete a "mission". due to some bad-luck, he is quickly identified by a roguish copy (who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit-man), and is quickly apprehended and captured. this state of affairs doesn't last long though, as the un-named assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly. the hunt is on, and a cat-and-mouse game between the police and the "mad dog" (as the police refer to him) ensues. along the way, mad dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow-witted young woman, and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation. the ante keeps getting upped as mad dog's only objective is to get out of hong kong and back to thailand by any means necessary, and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive...i could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film, but i don't want to give too much away. i watched dog bite dog knowing nothing about the premise, and i think it's the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way. as to comparisons to the older-style catiii films...there are some similarities. dog bite dog has some hyper-violent moments reminiscent of the "good ol' days", but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old-school classicks like the untold story or red to kill. where many of the older catiii films' main intention was to "shock" - dog bite dog is a far more thought-out and well-rounded production (though that's not to take anything away from those catiii films that i hold so dear...). this film is far more "emotional" than it is exploitative, and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds, the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides. there really are no clear-cut "good" and "bad" guys, as mad dog shows moments of extreme compassion, and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer. there's also no nudity/sex in this film, which is a typical characteristic of the older catiii films. personally, i would compare dog bite dog more to park's sympathy for mr. vengeance or perhaps the pang brother's bangkok dangerous, as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence. again - there's pretty much nothing that i didn't like about this film. the acting is dead-on, the cinematography is sharp and well done, and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn't seen very often. is this film (and others like it...) the "rebirth" of the catiii film - not exactly - but it is a very solid film that's absolutely worth checking out...9/10

those individuals familiar with asian cinema, as a whole, are aware that japan is renowned, or notorious, for it's hyper-violent films and korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films. dog bites dog, while not necessarily getting as hyper-violent as the craziest miike film, nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some koreas more ambitious efforts, it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it's own. the greatest strength this film has though, like the greatest of the japanese or korean efforts, is that the brutality, rather than detracting from the film, actually develops the characters, if not, pushing the story forward. the two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such. sam lee's character, for instance, is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely, amidst various encounters with chang's character, it is revealed why he is. without spoiling this part of the story too much, it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father. chang's character, on the other hand, has his most primal instincts honed to, if not perfection, brutal efficiency. surprisingly, chang's story arch, while not necessarily revealing a more human side, actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal (and no i am not talking about sam lee, rather pei pei's garbage dump girl character). ultimately however, for the first 80 minutes or so, it is a, more or less, straight forward cat and mouse, or dog chase dog, film in which every encounter ends in at least one death (seriously, once sam lee and chang square off, some one will die) and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act. which brings us to the film's one weakness. unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but, to put it simply, it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since, rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film, the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it. don't get me wrong, if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn't filled with sweet music (in fact if it, like the majority of the film, kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job), it still could have worked and not detract from the film. as it is though, despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters, the way it was handled made it feel tacked on, and almost, insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across. nevertheless, it is still a breath of fresh air from hong kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact.

wow. if you think that a film can't fatigue in some way, then you haven't seen dog bite dog. this film pulls no punches, and it doesn't shy away from showing very disturbing images at all. much like salo, this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit. it is gritty, dark, depressing and hopeless, but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of hong kong.the script is much more of the same, but don't go on thinking it is incredibly clichéd. it basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game, against a professional and emotionless hit-man. while the script offers nothing new on the surface, it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity. is violence really that necessary? do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child, without pity, without remorse? in turn, we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger, this is a sad truth. it is a topic that the director brilliantly explores, without limiting himself at all. besides the cat and mouse chase, the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters. one is about love, and the other is about redemption. even if the script isn't that new, it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times. the acting is really, really good. edison chen as the hit-man is incredible; he proves that he isn't just any pretty face. he is ruthless, vile and beyond likable. sam lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding. the supporting cast, in short, is excellent. the music is also worth mentioning. very somber score by ben cheung, with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film. the cinematography by yuen man is also really good.overall, this catiii film is highly recommended. very well paced, incredibly acted, marvelously scored and just really good at the end of it all. however, as many have pointed out, this is not a movie for everyone. if you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one. if you don't like seeing heavy negativity in film then this isn't for you too. in the end, a powerhouse film, 8/10.

this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time, i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title. loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lee's impossibly believable insane behavior and edison's portrayal of a killer machine, which totally reversed his normal idol image. i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie. however, i must warn you, this is also an equally depressing movie, as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own, and struggling to breathe. makes you think about what is life about really.

it's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most (over)used story lines in cinema! "dog bite dog" is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal, only pou-soi cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent & relentless. this is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies i've ever seen, with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell! not even the installments in chan-wook park's trilogy of vengeance (with the exception of "oldboy", perhaps) or any other infamous cat-iii film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in "dog bite dog". pang is a young and ruthless cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of hong kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant. when the police arrives at the place, young officer wai sees how pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him. the first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath, as pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even wai's long time friend and colleague. from then on begins a thrilling and action-packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer. the latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump. what makes this routine action/thriller so fascinating (apart from the explicit violence) are the main characters' backgrounds! pang, the hit-man, is a cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight & kill for money ever since he was a child. he knows no restrictions, has no mercy and barely speaks a word. wai, the cop, became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his role-model father (also a cop) lies in a coma after a drug-related incident. lai doesn't question suspects and witnesses; he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis. people with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film, because the cruelty and shocks featuring in "dog bite dog" can easily cause nausea. it's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air, but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically. the filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying. the performances are terrific! i wouldn't be surprised if edison chen and sam lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well, because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate. "dog bite dog" is a powerful and unforgettable film, highly recommended if you can stomach it. if you fear you can't, just wait a few years for the inevitable american remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little.

one of the most nihilistic and brutal films i've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving ones. this is an action-melodrama like the world has never seen it before. sometimes the plot got me close to tears, while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone-crunching blow to the guts. chilling performance by edison chen. the story of a hk-cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down, while bit by bit losing their humanity, is a strong one. featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera-work, "dog bite dog" is pure hk-bloodshed without the heroism.

finally we have before us a category iii movie for the summer 2006 season. made of equal parts cruelty, crime and passion, dog bite dog benefits not merely from an apt title, but also flexible direction, superb cinematography and respectable performances from most involved. of course there has to be a catch, manifested here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies, yet all told dbd represents the mature spirit we'd love to see more of in the hk mainstream.it also marks the heralded return of edison chen, long absent since the initial d debacle of a year ago. chen's reserved machismo does wonders for the movie, yet would have had it rough without opposite sam lee, whose knack for alternating between physical comedy (crazy 'n' the city, no problem 2) and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role we've seen from him since made in hong kong.together, the duo makes dog bite dog, and hopefully edison's going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence: his touch transformed projects from princess d to the infernal affairs saga, and still he remains a rare occurrence.mostly upon commencing, dbd showcases some mesmerizing imagery, playing gorgeous tricks with light, shadow and perspective. the soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect, adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys. much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer matt chow, previously engaged in likewise gruesome three extremes. dog bite dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project, namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner.rest assured, though, this isn't a horror movie, instead following a path trodden before by classic one nite in mongkok, albeit from a miles more perverse angle. replacing daniel wu's reluctant mainland assassin character we have edison, playing a nameless killing machine hailing from cambodia's underworld. sent hong kong-way to execute a single target, the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival, a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the film's brilliant visuals.although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer, edison's eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail, picked up on by a cid team sent to investigate. this assembly features a nice cameo by mob-movie stalwart lam suet, and good support from tv star wayne lai. however, sam lee's renegade officer wai leads the charge, revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless. we gradually learn wai's inner-conflict stems from his father's police corruption background, evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues.a minor body count transpires, as edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no-no. there's quite the violence quotient in store, even though gore per se feels toned down in places, and adult language only makes a token appearance. once more, no nudity, leading one to conclude cat iii's are being handed these days a bit hastily. still, dbd's a relatively mature theatrical release, and we applaud its arrival.in between the fighting, stabbing , hacking and shooting, even a career murderer needs some romance, and just like daniel wu had cecilia cheung in one nite, so does intrepid mr. chen get a sweetheart, done beautifully by new comer pei pei. her unnamed character (lots of anonymity in this one) meets edison's at a strangely deserted landfill, abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape. when the killer ditches hk, he agrees to take her with him, and they go on the run together, love blooming en route. while the movie doesn't linger on lovey-dovey stuff, our hearts go out to pei pei's tragic character and her endless suffering. she renders the timid but valiant protagonist amazingly well, establishing that there aren't any good or bad guys here, evinced by the highly sobering finale.director cheang soi's portfolio includes recent suspense thriller home sweet home and love battlefield with eason chan, two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts by dog bite dog's sinister demeanor. cheang manages to keep dbd flowing throughout, and considering the many parts in play here, stands up to critical standards erected by people like johnny to in his watershed nocturnal epic the mission. a couple of glitches do come about, to wit edison miraculously shrugging off a shot to the chest, but these are highly forgivable.marking triumphant returns for two young, talented performers of the kind hong kong needs if we want the city's movie heyday to come back, dog bite dog doesn't stand out for story. its forte lies in strong portrayals and style, buoyed along on the strength of thespian muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse.hk has a long, time-honored tradition of stories to do with the city's nighttime alter-ego, something dog bite dog upholds lovingly, amounting to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece.rating: * * * *

what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show?i'm sure you've all seen the matrix by now. the creators of the matrix say that it is 'anime inspired'. just from watching the trailer to this classic, you can see where they took the plot from.the film is sort of set in 1980s japan, and it really shows. the costumes, music and words(in the recent english language version by ad vision) are all like they've been directly lifted from the era. i believe it was made in that time also, but due to certain plot points, this doesn't date the film!as you probably guessed by my referencing to the matrix, the world isn't real. it's not really the 1980's. in fact, it's something more like the 2480's. after a nuclear war, the earth(or "biosphere prime")'s ecosystem was destroyed. the survivors we're forced to escape into space, where the conflict continued. once the planets(or "biospheres") were all abandoned, people began to live in megazones - cities inside of spaceships, where, via hypnotism techniques and truman show-esque illusion, they were made to believe they we're back on earth, in the most peaceful time in recent memory... the 1980s. when young shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle, it leads him to find out more than he's supposed to know... the garland(a bike which becomes a mech), a weapon from the 2400's, aids shogo in his escape from the pursuing military. as more and more is discovered about the megazone, the war comes closer to home, and due to conflicts between the military and the computer, the war comes to the megazone too... i apologise if those points are seen as spoilers, but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis.emotions run high in this movie, moreso than the matrix. you really do believe the war is going on, and shogo really does become quite scarred by what he's discovering. what starts off as an uber-happy cool 80's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality. these characters are real people, not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet-time in the matrix. there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy, and a war. it may just choke you up towards the end... i know it did me.animation is pretty impressive for it's day, and the picture quality on the advision dvd is unbelievable for it's age. the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime, very cultural. be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood, there's also an erotic sex scene.the ending can be seen as a 'there can be no ending', similar to the matrix, or, supposedly can be followed by the sequel, which i haven't yet had the pleasure of watching.i have to say that this is one of the best animes i've seen, in fact, one of the best movies i've seen, and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time.i must recommend the advision dvd, as their take on the english language is incredible, and does the movie justice, and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released, which will have the same vocal cast.all in all, megazone 23 is an incredible movie, and deserves to be held highly, and should be an essential in any anime fan's collection. heck, even my mother enjoyed it.

here's the skinny, it seems that this is much older then i thought it was. but it's still cool. the bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part. there are some character issues that i hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a macross knock off. not just the animation style but several character designs. for example all the girls in this movie look like lyn minmay of macross. the mechs look similar to macross as well as the other characters. this is really not made for little kids, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. so to make a long story short i give this cool macross knock-off 7 stars.

this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye. ill never forget my experience watching it. i don't understand why people don't think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull, pacino in scarface, and crowe in gladiator combined. this should be released on dvd in superbit format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it. whoppi goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough, gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi-jinx ensues to say the least. by the way i'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage.

i enjoyed it. in general, i'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but i do like whoopi. i'm also partial to sci/fi fantasy. and the dinosaur craze. i read for pleasure, but when i'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, i watch tv & movies to escape. theodore rex enabled me to do so. that makes it a success in my eyes! i didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running. whether or not it was rated as "good" or not doesn't really matter to me. and no, i'm not a juvenile. nor am i a moron.

this movie is excellent and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. or, even better, you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over. i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then. but after watching it again yesterday i've found it to be amazing.a good blend of comedy (although not as great as "mr magoo"-another one of my favorites) and action. this deserves 10/10 and i'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon (fingers crossed). if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then i'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :).

compelling and innovative! at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the 1941 orson welles classic "citizen kane". the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel, but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies. in "citizen kane" charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings, much like whoopi goldberg in this movie. this movie is about finding love in everybody's differences. it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self-absorption. whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages, with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall, hepburn and tracy and hall and oates. if you would love to watch an uplifting, celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives; bergman-esqe but not as depressing, theodore rex should be viewed immediately!

theodore rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time, and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression!! in this compelling intellectual masterpiece, jonathan r. betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century, such as francis ford copola, martin scorcese, orson welles and roman polanski. the special effects are nothing less than breathtaking, and make any work by spielberg look trite and elementary. at the time of it's release, theodore rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film-making to levels never anticipated by film makers. the concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur, but adapting an action packed, thrilling detective novel, co-staring a "talking" dinosaur with a post-modern name such as "theodore", and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it. the world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. watching theodore rex is much akin to looking into the face of god and hearing him say "you are my most beloved creation." this is one of the few films that is simply to die for!!!

i give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting "guess who" game. the movie, however, needs more robin in it. he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest. i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character, let alone knightwing. this movie just continues that bad tradition. the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which wouldn't be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn't so unbelievable. it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it.

i thought the film could be a bit more complex,in a psychological sense perhaps, but the action and voice acting were top notch. the animation was heavy cg in many scenes, but very good ones at that. this is one of the batman returns/forever type films, which include romances and the conflicts of wayne and motives for dating. 007 fans would love this, and so would the females, great theme song! wayne was portrayed very well in this film, and the penquin was back to his true form, no mutant genes in him this time! i liked the fact robin wasn't used too much, tim drake was just a good computer nerd, somewhat of an indigo child or mind of the future.the supporting cast was made up of some soap opera stars, decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors too. kelly ripa was hilarious in this film.i rate this below phantasm, return of the joker, and batman vs. dracula, but liked the smarter script better than i enjoyed subzero. 7/10

i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action films.i've seen all of the animated films, but out of the bunch, this is the poorest, and it's rather disappointing."mask of the phantasm" would rank as the best, then "world's finest", then "sub zero", then "return of the joker", and finally this ranks last.in this newest animated movie, there's a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether she's friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeance.but as bruce gets involved with three young women, he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl.the tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak, which was rather disappointing. bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time, the villains are re-used from the last films, and while the action scenes are exciting, they're really nothing new. it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have, especially that of "sub-zero" which was heavy in drama and character development.everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting for.all the while, i really enjoyed this, i had a blast, and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising, but this wasn't as exciting as i'd hoped.(**half out of ****)

in 1993, with the success of the first season of batman: the animated series, warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for direct-to-video, but bumped up to theatrical status. it would become known as batman: mask of the phantasm. ten years after phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the wb, sub-zero, return of the joker, and now, mystery of the batwoman joins the family.the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm: a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin. now, batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line.the animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was utilized for batman: the animated series' fifth and sixth seasons (aka the new batman adventures). , it's quite nicely done, and just as sleek as return of the joker's animation. there is also some use of cgi, but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub-zero. the music was alright. different and exotic and similar to the justice league score, although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts.kevin conroy, as always, does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman. it's also great to have the old batman: the animated series alumni back; that includes bob hastings (commissioner gordon), robert costanzo (detective bullock), tara strong (barbara gordon/batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond), and efrem zimbalist jr.(alfred).villains were also great - especially given that rupert thorne, the old mob boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season.overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago, motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films. and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short chase me.

batman: mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video/dvd movie to be released. (minor spoilers ahead) the plot revolves around a new crimefighter, the batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a major arms shipment.although the movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as 'mask of the phantasm,' 'sub-zero,' or 'return of the joker.' the main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did. at the end of this movie, we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others, especially, 'sub-zero.' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us. even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character (as mr. freeze or phantasm were). not only that, but batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don't get this special emotional appeal.don't get me wrong, i did find the movie enjoyable. it does have its moments, such as, when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'batman: the animated series.' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments.if the batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker' in my book, but as it is now, it's in 4th (out of 4).as for the animation, it's the same as the new batman adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990's. the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films, but it's still good nonetheless.i do recommend buying this dvd because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. but just remember, it's not as good as the other batman animated movies.7/10

it aired on tv yesterday, so i decided to check it out. this was one of the last bruce timm/paul dini dtv projects related to their old 1992 batman the animated series, after that jeff matsuda came along and re-imagined batman with his new the batman series, but anyway, the story of this new batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as batwoman, however batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods, and also in the meantime take down the pengiun and ruphert thorn who both are secretly working with carlton duquesne(who's having family troubles) and another villain(which is later revealed in the movie) on a weapons smuggling operation,they also put a bounty on the batwoman. the question is: who is this mysterious batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one? it's up to batman to solve this mystery and stop penguin's latest operation. for an animated movie, it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone, which is good. another plus was the complete redesign of the penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated mob boss we're used to seeing in the comics, unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from tim burton vision of pengium(sewer rat and circus freak). even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say, batman forever. the voice acting is standard quality for these direct-to-video projects(if only batman: mask of phantasm took this route), kevin conroy still shines as batman/bruce wayne. and like i said despite running for some very short 80 minutes, it manages to make a pretty good(and complex) storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action. there are a few downsides, however, nightwing is nowhere to be seen, and i'm sure barbara gordon and bruce wayne don't click as a couple, even though is just referenced, tim drake(aka robin) does very little in the movie and to be quite frank, i was never a big fan of paul dini and bruce timm's batman character design(especially in their batman shows post-btas), this the new adventures of batman and robin, well, it kinda makes batman look fat then rather a well-built bulked up individual(kinda like the jeff matsuda character model from the batman). bruce wayne seems a bit awkward, those blue eyes make him look more like clark kent then bruce(though it's true they do look very much alike). another downside is rupert throne(no explanation as to why he is in this deal, but it's safe to say he's has goons and what's a cut of the deal) which does very little more then hang out with the penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone(count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised. overall, a good batman animated movie, worth at least a rental.

an enjoyable batman animated film. not on par with "return of the joker" or "mask of the phantasm", but solid nonetheless. i liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who batwoman was. there was nice twist. nice action sequences. i've always been of the opinion that the batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful batman live action film sequels. the trend continues here.7.5 out of 10

this post may contain spoilers :although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league, this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library. why? well, if mask of the phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of batman: the animated series and subzero compliments the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin, then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the gotham knights version of batman. kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection. i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50's comics of batman. but i was blown away by the batwoman character, her look, her costume (which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond)and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through. if you want to know who batwoman is, then buy or rent the dvd. barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond. tim drake appears as robin, but his role is a small one and sadly, there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing, which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven (his city in the comics).of the three suspects for batwoman, my favorite is kathy duquesne, who looks an awful lot like halle berry. kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects. when it comes to the villains, i'm glad the penguin was one of them, but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers. pengy just didn't sound right. same thing goes for robin. the new guy did okay, but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia, they replaced him. it's interesting to note that kevin michael richardson, who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in "the batman" series. and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he didn't show up in the gotham knights episodes. the late john vernon will be missed. although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane, if he had to be replaced, they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo. i only wish they could have used two face, riddler, or the scary new version of the scarecrow.the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb. i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song, betcha neva. while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero, i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest, plus like i said earlier, it's a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman, which i think gives a good balance. i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie, but personally, it's well worth the purchase. i give mystery of the batwoman a 9.

the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness. there's a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman, so much more than batman forever or batman and robin.there's a new crime-fighter on the streets of gotham. she dresses like a bat but she's not a grown-up batgirl. and batman is denying any affiliation with her. meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. but the penguin, bain and the local mob makes things little more complicated.i didn't have high hopes for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak batman: sub zero (robin isn't featured so much here!)but i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces, the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor. this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without. keep your ears open for a really catchy song called 'betcha neva' which is featured prominently through-out.it's a shame the dvd isn't so great. don't get me wrong there are some great features (the short 'chase me' is awesome) and a very cool dolby 5.1 soundtrack but... the movie is presented in pan and scan. batman: mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1.85:1 but this dvd is presented in 1.33:1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides. i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen. warner have had to re-release literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles. why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me.i would give this dvd 5/5 but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to 4/5. it's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package.

for starters i have always been a fan of the batman cartoons because the theme is so universal, 'that everyone alive has an alter-ego'. this is true in the mystery of batwoman. while the overall story is good i'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this.throughout the movie, you are trying to find out who the identity of batwoman is, unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website (so if you haven't seen it already don't go there). i was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer. 75 minutes is way too short for any movie. the secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie, sort of midway, and becomes anti-climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as batwoman will disappear after the movie is over.i'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie. i love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for. some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline. i also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes, it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is batman. similarly we should've gotten to know more about batwoman's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with bruce wayne. also i think the fight with bane should have been done better. in typical children's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping, falling, getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them. come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either.bottom line, its a good entertaining flick and i recommend anyone who's a batman fan to watch it. it has good storyline, universal appeal and even great acting to top it off. i just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making batwoman stay to make things more interesting. not just introduce her and then kick her off once she's done. i'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally. to have some other than batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details.i hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between bruce wayne and barbra gordan. he's been stringing her along forever and doesn't even like her and i can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older. i also want to see the time when tim drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man. in short i want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in batman beyond. otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story.

this batman movie isn't quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr. freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie. this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman/ bruce wayne, tara strong as barbra gordon, efrem zimbalist jr., eli marienthal as robin. the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman, david ogden stiers as the pequin, hector elizondo as bane. so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen. so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good.overall score: ******* out of ********** *** out of *****

"batman: the mystery of the batwoman" is about as entertaining as animated batman movies get.while still true to the feeling of the comic books, the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series. bruce wayne looks much like he has before, but now he appears somewhat less imposing. the dick grayson robin has been replaced by the less edgy, more youthful tim drake robin.kevin conroy, as usual, invokes the voice of batman better than most live action actors.kelly ripa did a much more decent voice-acting job than i was expecting.as in the live action batman films, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains. my all-time favorite, the penguin, is here. his design is sleeker than it has appeared before, hearkening more to the burgess meredith portrayal of the '60's than the danny devito portrayal of "batman returns." david ogden stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice. the penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate, just as he most commonly appears in the comics. hector elizondo's voice creates a bane who's much more memorable than the forgettable version in "batman & robin." and finally, batman has a descent mystery to solve, putting the "detective" back in "detective comics" (that is what "dc" stands for, after all.) the revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist.the score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie. it sounds like a mix between the score from "poirot" and the score from "mission: impossible." all in all, it's more entertaining than your average cartoon.

"the big goodbye" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case captain picard posing as private investigator dixon hill. this episodes creates some sort of standard pattern, repeated several times on tng as well as ds 9 and voyager. after entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck's safety program). this concept is used to expand star trek's possibility and enabling a kind of genre-mix. picard's dixon hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as film noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead (see for example chandler's marlowe stories or polanski's all time classic "chinatown"). star trek never focuses on the story (mostly it's a simple "how-do-we-get-out-of-here" scenario) but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters. those holodeck "games" are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound (but did star trek ever had a technical, scientific point to it, i mean besides some utopic concepts?)."the big goodbye" shows a relaxed patrick stewart, a mcfadden that hardly ever looked better in a star trek episode (at least the early ones) and data has some great scenes, too (although i find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp's plug out of the wall would have really surprised him, for the fact that he'd done research on that period and its customs). wesley continues turning peaceful trekkies into potential murderers (why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off?) but all in all this one's fun...

this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world. the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them. a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins. the settings are superb and almost movie like. alas, the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it's safety devices stop working. picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s america and return to the jarada rendezvous. picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada. this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there

this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st season where a holodeck malfunction traps captain picard, beverly, data, and a starfleet historian named waylan within a 1930's san francisco setting. this episode is an homage to raymond chandler's "maltese falcon" where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role - complete with fedora and trenchcoat. the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey's "maltese falcon." this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the jarada that communicate with mostly a high-pitched buzzing sound. communication with this alien race is difficult, and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. the best part of this episode, though, is the appearance of the famous hollywood b-actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock. he was such a handsome man back in the 1940's. oh, well...

i'll be honest with you...i liked this movie. it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but is also packed with bad zombie effects. part iv, entitled "after death" is also good. i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.10 out of 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, slumber party massacre, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

this movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.just remember this: when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies... be they good or bad... this is the formula that they are using. this is what makes zombie movies so great.and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know.all in all, it doesn't linger. there's never a point where you think to yourself "c'mon, get on with it"... it moves quick and corners nicely. this is the sporty, little italian number of zombie flicks.so awful, it's wonderful! if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it.as a great trivia note: if you're watching it on dvd, you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... well... that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop.

i think this film has much to recommend it, particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr. foxx. although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very hard to follow in some cases, all in all, it makes for a nice time in front of the tube.

nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie-flicks, but  honestly  why would we bother? every single film in the zombi-"series" delivers great fun, nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and "zombi 3" is no exception to this, despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting. this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project, who had to elaborate further on his "zombi 2" success, but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films. the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every ingenious idea from george a. romero's "night of the living dead" and "the crazies" is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at. yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything! on a secret army base at the phillipines, scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus "death one" and prepare it for transport. after a failing attempt to steal the virus, the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie-ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village. the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's "nightmare city". truly bad...but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations. the undead birds were original, for example, and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well. the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick. recommended to the fans; don't mind the negative reviews.

we have high expectations with this one . . . because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci . . . however . . . its co-directed by bruno mattei (from night of the zombies) and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso (night of the zombies) and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies (hell of the living dead) a lot. as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2. fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi (?) and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic . . . zombi 3 is not magical . . . its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter. but over the years, i've grown to accept zombi 3. i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room . . . there was a senseless fulci-cut and the mattei/fulci-cut is the one on dvd.

wow this was a great italian "zombie" movie by two great director's luci fulci ("zombie") and bruno mattie ("hell of the living dead") lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen "hell of the living dead" directed by bruno mattie and if you saw "zombie" directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great "zombie" make-up witch equals great looking "zombies" has a funny "zombie" flying head!and "zombie" birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a "zombie" (that only happed to two people) but they are mainly just the great toxic "zombies" like in bruno matties "hell of the living dead".so if you like italian "zombie" movies or just "zombie" movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian "zombie" movie!

a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised. soldiers are able to retrieve the case, but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out. they eventually make it to where he's hiding, and "cleanse" the hotel and its occupants. unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation, and if you've seen return of the living dead, you know what happens next.zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike, as a complete mess of a movie. while that's a fair assessment, it's not without it's high points. for one thing, it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy. there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible. they're in the water, the rafters of houses, hiding in trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush, only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape. there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. you have to see it to believe it, as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo. it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting, especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen, but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind. zombi 3 fits that bill, and then some. it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers, and watch it with some like minded friends. i give it an 8/10, just because of sheer enjoyment.

yeah sure it's cheesy, it's not zombie, but it's not that bad either. it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus, and it's entertaining. i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience, as he was never completely satisfied with it. it is well worth a search out, especially for genre and fulci fans. it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand.

off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly. secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno (rats, night of terror) mattei. this is no dawn of the dead folks.that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen. the script is wonderfully horrible. just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("let's try putting these two molecules together"). the zombies come in all varieties. from moaning shufflers, to machete wielding maniacs, to birds! the gore is plentiful. legs are bitten off, arms amputated, stomachs burst open. the pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. then there's the head in the fridge. oh the head in the fridge! one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2.you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film. get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night.did i mention the head in the fridge?!?!?

although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor (zombi 2) i actually like this one better. this is because of it's faster pace, better settings, and cool 80's soundtrack. it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci. the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good. it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness; for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror? there's even a flying zombie head! how rad is that? definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. also check out zombi 4.

zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making. firstly, it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2, with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a. romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi. confusing enough? basically, none of the films have anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money. i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out. bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time.zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare. scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok. the scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet. overall, i actually liked this film. i heard horrible things, but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable. the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution, corrupted military, man playing god, etc. i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when mattei came on board.besides ripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies. you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with, "when you see the men in white suits & gas masks, run to them for help." this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies. later, they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake.the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner. how is it cool? let me count the ways1. zombie birth 2. flying zombie head 3. zombie birds. 4. zombie with no legs swimming in a pool. my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station. he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl.favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, the scientists asks, "don't you think that once the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground, and contaminate everything?" to which the sargeant boldly replies, "now you're talking science fiction." he also continues to mention the "science fiction" told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.extras: gallery, trailers, and interviews, most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes, yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details.bottom line: a must see for zombie and fulci fans.rating: 7/10molly celaschi www.horroryearbook.com myspace.com/horroryearbook

i happened across "bait" on cable one night just as it started and thought, "eh, why not?" i'm glad i gave it a chance. "bait" ain't perfect. it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness. but overall, this movie worked. all the elements aligned just right, and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film. most of that, i think, is due to jamie foxx. i don't know who tagged foxx for the lead, but whoever it was did this movie a big favor. believable and amazingly likeable, foxx glides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. you can tell he's working on instinct, and instinct doesn't fail him.the plot, while unimportant, actually ties together pretty well, and there's even a character arc through which foxx's character grows as a person. again, they could've slipped by without any of this, but it just makes things that much better.i'm surprised at the low rating for this. maybe i just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but i'd give it a 7/10. bravo, mssr. foxx.

this film resembles in many ways `enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman, as we have an innocent (black) man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man. usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster. that does not apply here. of course i love everything david morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this film then that. the main baddy, played by doug hutchison, was brilliant, and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli. our hero, alvin sanders (played by jamie foxx), was however irritating most of the part. he is so out of place, cracking bad jokes, evoking no sympathy from the audience. or not to begin with, the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you (and on his followers as well!). i didn't expect much when i rented it, but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits. 7/10

if you like jamie foxx,(alvin sanders),"date from hell",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp, (jumbo size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and david morse,(edgar clenteen), "hack" '02 tv series, decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals. there is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard. jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture.

the movie is great and i like the story. i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell ( sick movie ) and highlander ( silly movie ). i just tell the truth, i like a reality hehe and also a true story :)

i liked this movie. when the guy who was in on a bank heist of $40 million in gold dies, his cell mate is used as "bait" to lead them to the high-tech crazy killer partner (by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge). it's an action, spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light. it reminded me of enemy of the state. well acted and good enough plot.

both my friend and i thought this movie was well done. we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts. we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy. i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job. most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid. we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie. if you don't buy rent it for a good time.

i really liked this movie. of course the idea is pretty much out there...the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding. but alvin sanders, the man who the feds have "volunteered" to be implanted with the device, is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while. alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem. definetly worth a watch.

i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie. this movie was not intended to be a "deep thought" movie, which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be. in fact, it would appear that if any movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2. don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people.this movie was an action/comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be. and for an action/comedy, it was very well done. i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did, having never really been a jamie foxx fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.the plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (see blue streak, hudson hawk, 48 hours, etc. etc. etc.) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist. now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the real "bad guy" is an uber-geek.jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in "the matrix" or a drama such as "of mice and men" then this movie isn't for you. but if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you. i would normally have rated it about an 8 (on the same level as the die hard trilogy), but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be.

i had no expectations; i'd never heard of jamie foxx; all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it. i thought it was highly entertaining; it was fun. the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest. to me, foxx is an original. david morse is terrific (true, this is not his finest role). i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done. i didn't expect a lot and i was happily surprised.

i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie. i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me. before i start my review, let me first say this...it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner, yet the writers and scott chose a different approach.plot:simply stated, it's not boring. most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people, often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit. this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while. just for reference, i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent, and i enjoyed them both tremendously, both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told. they don't take any chances whatsoever, and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films. domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking, "oh man, they're screwed now". and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films. it has a lot of depth to it, in my opinion, and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it. overall, this is what kept me so interested in the movie.characters:i felt that the characters were accurate. knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was. it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that.choco was also very believable, his use of spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to domino's lack of affection, as well as his jealousy issues within the team...they all rang true to me, which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic.rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still rang true to me. he seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it. he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes, yet is still trying to live.claremont/ladies: i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story. they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley, these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal. you could empathize with them because, to them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help.the mobsters: they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can. and i really liked that part. they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting.christopher walken/90210 guys:they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens. their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable.cinematography....yes....the cinematography. this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. but in my opinion i thought it was genius, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement, just like anything else. i both applaud and congratulate scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie. not only did they go far and above with its presentation, they went that much further. the use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob, bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else. if you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if any at all. this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it. i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach. hollywood films have grown predictable and bland. most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns. and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different.granted, this movie isn't for everyone, but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point. i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it. i would recommend this to all, but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few. i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie, but i think many people will. we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. and with that in mind, i think he succeeded tremendously.

ah, domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new to the cinema world. i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot, the varied characters, and the intense camera effects. i've seen some complain about the camera work and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time. all of what you see was the desired effect. perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before, although that's what sets it apart. in a deeper aspect, what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes, think about it.when it comes to the story, i don't see anything quite bad about it. despite it's "messy" nature, according to some, it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling. the plot really isn't all that hard to follow, if you actually focus on what's going on. maybe it's just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting, the plot, etc. i'm no "interpreter" or anything who picks movies apart, it just comes to me. with that said, i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed, despite it's future as a cult-classic, blockbuster, or whatever.and the characters, well there's no doubting how varied the cast is. i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively, that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen. the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives, setting them apart even further. basically, i personally loved the cast and characters.all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don't see it as i do, or it just doesn't appeal to them. no matter, this is a great film in it's own right, no, it's a great film period.

when i rented domino i was expected it to be very dumb. i hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and domino also just got very bad reviews. the only reason i watched it is because i like have liked keira knightley, mickey rourke, christopher walken, and tony scott on other occasions. i also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories. yes the editing and cinematography were frantic, the story was weak, and the acting was mediocre, but i still loved this film for some bizarre reason. domino was very, very entertaining and often very funny. it was horribly underrated when it was released i think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like scotts last film man on fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment. i actually understand why everybody hated domino so much, even though i loved it and recommend it.

kiera nightly moved straight from the p&p set to this action movie... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically. a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen's classic, she is, once again, "having a go". just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle, it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life... but then this is exactly what domino harvey (the real one) did, and i (being one of nightly's biggest fans) believe she carries if off.stuff....* 90210 (for the non american world) is the post code of beverly hills in la, where all the film stars live. * domino harvey father's mostfamous film was manchurian candidate (which appears in the film). * domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005, after having been arrested for drug dealing. she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film. * kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu.if you find this film a bit far fetched, then check out domino harvey, as the facts are more amazing than the fiction.

domino is a great movie. it's about a young woman names domino harvey (kiera knightley) who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. she joins with two fellow hunters (mickey rourke & edgar ramirez) and the adventures begin. the script is good. very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film. the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do, instead of the character of domino.even with that, kiera knightley gives a fierce performance. she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. mickey rourke follows up his oscar-worthy performance in 'sin city' with another tough-guy performance. edgar ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera. delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performance. mo'nique was herself, although she did surprise me on one particular scene. lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with her.the best thing about the movie though, is the direction. tony scott's fast-paced style really brings the movie to life. the cinematography is some of the best, i've ever seen. it takes a regular movie and puts on acid. all the blacks are blacker, the whites are brighter, and it has a sort of green glow to it. the action scenes are exhilarating.overall: if you liked sin city & man on fire, you'll like domino.

as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick, i said "i have to watch this movie". she's the undisputed main character, domino, a bounty hunter. her "job", as the "no action" scenes would teach us, reflects her rebel, violent attitude to life. i have to admit that it's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands. so, this stomped me a bit. anyway, for all the john woo's fans, there are helicopters falling down, explosions, gunfire as if it would rain, and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns, one per hand. the cast is absolutely brilliant. going beyond keira, which in this movie is a real tomboy, pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see, mickey rourke is back, with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body. christopher walken makes his job pretty well, as a reality show producer.let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape. the talk show scene is "disgustingly" real. anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what, can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations. as well as the producer, when domino's mom says that the reality that should show domino's life is "trash; no offense", he answers "i don't take it like an offense". this movie portrays a difficult life. domino, coming from a world that didn't want her, ed (mickey rourke), a bounty hunter "not so bounty", choco (the third guy of the band), which family is (using ed's words), "the correctional institutes he's been", and alf, the driver/bomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation. this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born "without the shirt"; unlucky, violent, and with nothing to lose, excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives. the intro of the movie says that it is "inspired by true story . . . more or less", so i couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true. anyway, going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been "added" to make the film easier to see, and be classified as an action movie), the characters' story is too realistic to be "edulcorated". the interaction between the characters is various, well studied, and definitely not boring. what hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (lucy liu, sober as never in her acting career). it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story (and that's a story). probably, the only "con", in a movie with a lot of "pros". all in all: this isn't "swat". the characters are crafted; they have an identity, a shape. they have a name and a surname (not just "gamble" and "street"). it's the case to say, it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet.

i doubt much of this film is based on a true story. at the beginning it says based on a true story, sort of. i bet the only truth to it was there was an ex-model turned bounty hunter possibly named domino.anyways, it begins with domino talking to lucy liu, who works for the fbi. domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars. through flashbacks, we see domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. she basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off, ed and choco. they let her join the group. she's tough, can use any kind of weapon, and will use her good looks if needed.they get involved with a scam that clarmont, a bailsman, has going. along the way, the group starts a reality tv show, and that's where ian zering and brian austin green become involved. they are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this.i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs. the editing didn't bother me. there's also a lot of violence, mainly using guns, and blood. it could have been a little shorter.final verdict: good enough to watch.

actually this movie was not so bad. it contains action, comedy and excitement. there are good actors in this film, for instance doug hutchison (percy from "the green mile"), who plays bristol. another well known actor is jamie kennedy, from "scream" and "three kings". the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who most surprised me, was david morse as edgar clenteen. he plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like "the green mile", "indian runner", "the negotiator" or "the langoliers" he plays a very sympathetic person, and in "bait" the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see. the only really negative thing about this film, are the several pictures of the world trade center, which makes this film perhaps look a little dated. overall i thought this was a pretty good little film!

i'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum, and many of the reviews. i think tony scott made a good movie here. yes, it is highly stylized, flashy and over the top, but it is very entertaining. i'm glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me :) this movie may not be for anyone, but if you like over-the-top, dark humor, cool action and dialog, you should see it. i've previously seen scott's man on fire, crimson tide and enemy of the state - all good movies, but i like this one more. it's like a roller-coaster ride, with great soundtrack selections, visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity, gory violence, and have explicit dialog.it doesn't hurt that keira is super-hot, and even shows nipples in this one, either...

i rented domino on a whim, not even knowing it was inspired by a true story, and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see. i found it to be rather awesome.with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment. and once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it. domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career. it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott. and with fast paced music and editing, it provides the visual flare to keep your attention, with slick performances and unexpected comedy, the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience. i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours.

if you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. this movie contains what hemmingway described as the "iceberg effect". on the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. if this would be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very well pass you by. definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. experimental cinematography barely describes this movie. the camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in american movies as of late). although, at some parts it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. the only aspect of the movie that i would write off as "needs improvement" is the soundtrack selection. no movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip). the flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another "artistic" aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand. however, that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch, and not one you'll quickly get bored of. 8.5/10

if you find yourself in need of an escape, something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world, domino will satisfy that need. this is entertainment, after all! the plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies (like usual suspects) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out. i wondered about domino harvey herself, how her life became of interest to hollywood. as for the acting, lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers. and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well. not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume. and granted, mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people.

" domino " has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and " sickening " photography. it's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of " style over substance" i couldn't disagree more. i believe that " domino " represents the absolute height of tony scott's film-making career. after having created the dominant hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties tony scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. as early as "crimson tide" scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing. this was then carried through to " enemy of the state" and "spy game" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. " man on fire" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. here scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage . although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in " domino"couched in the framing device of an fbi interrogation " domino" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. she grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. as domino relays her story verbally scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. she does have " traces of mescaline" in her system but her individual vision is anyway unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting. it is when domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that scott really lets rip. together with cinematographer dan mindel and composer harry-gregson williams scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary americana. gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be domino is no more disjointed than the "90210" culture she has rejected. as she wades through this cultural melange scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. ultimately scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip. to criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a picasso or a pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. like any great painting the meaning in " domino" is in the surface and the surface is everything. i am not in any way associated with scott free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of tony scott's work

my name is domino harvery. {edit *dizzying* chop} my--my--my name is domino harvey. {cut, chop} my name is domino harvey. {edit. cut. playback}never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before. by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy, flashy, dizzying editing technique. if i have to choose between loving it and hating it, i'd say i love it. it was borderline distracting at times, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality (even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos).this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy. otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her, no matter how much she suffered. we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke, rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez. the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walken's tv production company (what is christopher walken doing in every film, by the way?). i guess that is a clever film technique, because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv/reality show editing footage as he likes. it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this point.it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace, with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence. there are some funny jokes; it's all very modern and surreal at the same time. it's a mess, but it's a rather enjoyable mess. it is ultimately flawed in so many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters "cool", for one) but it works. i give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film  but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well.7 out of 10

i watched this movie once and might watch it again, but although jamie foxx is good in the movie, i feel they could have used a 'less funny' character as alvin sanders. foxx's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen (david morse) are too funny. david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop. his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role. once again morse meets doug hutchinson (bristol) in the theater. morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson. they are both perfect for this scenario in each film. i personally love that quality in a film, where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film, as these two did in the green mile. overall it was a pretty good movie.

you know the story - a group of plucky no-hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning - it's a tale that has been done to death by hollywood (bring it on, the karate kid, escape to victory, best of the best etc). now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying.the fact that this movie doesn't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters, and this in turn keeps you watching to the end.fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu films; the action is limited to (albeit impressive) kicking and the occasional punch. this doesn't matter though, since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success.

a good korean film about not just taekwondo but what its takes to be good, like a thugs way of fighting cannot beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules, just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion.the martial arts in the film isn't that good but it is passable and enjoyable. friends who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart. this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick, but it also carries a message.a good film again from korea.

the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do. the films props itself as a fun and entertaining time. and that's exactly what it was. it is the korean version of a male bring it on.from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another. instead, the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining "thugs" came to be men in their own right. therefore, the film is fun and entertaining.the camera work, specially the dolly moves were very well executed. the script, being a tad weak, was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire. this film will not win any oscars, nor any dvd blockbuster sales, but a fun watch and a fun experience.

sure, the plot isn't oldboy. it seems the only "great" movies these days are amazingly shocking or high-budget/hyped in some way.spin kick is a drama/comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do. regardless of what you expect from this film, you're guaranteed to feel moved by the work, pain, and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience. though comedic at times, many moments and characters are rendered beautifully: there's the old guard character who takes things too seriously, the hoodlum turned good-guy who just wants a second chance at life, the meek team-substitute who would die happy if he just won once in his life, and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems-- but most importantly, their own their hopes and dreams. while the plot and the goals of the movie are simple, these aspects of the movie merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and inter-personal struggles. in short, this film will leave you feeling fresh, determined, and satisfied.

first things first! this isn't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it! i think you can compare it to american sports movies! where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable,winning a game or tournament beyond expectation! in this case it isn't about football or baseball,but taekwondo! in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing! but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life! it is nice to see them struggle and training! i was surprised how funny this movie was! from start till the end you will laugh your pants off! the young korean actors are very convincing! go see this wonderful feel good movie!

this movie surprised me. some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "enemy of the state" starring will smith. but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo (providing some comic relief). this is a movie you can watch over again-say... some wednesday night when nothing else is on. i gave it a 9 for entertainment value.

i have to agree with most of the other posts. was it a comedy? a drama? to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side. i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived. jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name. in new york, how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland.and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold. again, a comedy or drama? but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning. i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance, she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. she is a younger actress that is going to be viable.

this film was excellent, i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. this one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi, and he sure did that a lot :)

this is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that "party on the left is now party on the right." like the original, this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty. it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous, and over-powerful federal government. kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge, where the us government, with the cooperation of the mainstream media, threw around words like "white supremacist" and "right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights, with the willing acquiescence of the general populace. that message is so non-pc, i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick, katherine prudhomme, the western journalism center, and countless others who dared to speak out. "live free or die" is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays "the voice," and that sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film.

i really liked this version of 'vanishing point' as opposed to the 1971 version. i found the 1971 version quite boring. if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as i did with the 1971 version) than to me, it is not all that great. of course, this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. however, i have seen many remakes, where i have liked the original and older one better. i found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. in my opinion, i felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so "blase".(boring)

sure this was a remake of a 70's film, but it had the suspense and action of a current film, say breakdown. he's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern. the chases were very good, the part with him beingcornered at a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger. this is better than bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed badly? vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law, few movies had the effects-night vision, cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie, guy has 76'caddy souped up, toys with guy he upset. the ending is great, you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not, a very good did-he-make-it-or-not.

its not as good as the first movie,but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes,on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife,the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion,

sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it. the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film, and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules. most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a tv movie! despite all of the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. however, it was nice to see tucson, arizona prominently featured in the film.

spoilers through: i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie. it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original.something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus, have little to compare it to. this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.there were a few things i liked about it. one was the casting of kowalkski. viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. this was a great role for him.another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it's made for television. i had no idea this was the case when watching it. it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.i also found the story to be very absorbing. i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this. plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama, mysticism, a love story, quirky people every which way you turned. (i didn't even recognize priestly.) and it was touching. this was not a great movie but it is watchable.and then there's the ending. it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point, it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. i am not sure how i feel about the ending. the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible, it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie.so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way, which i don't usually like but for some reason, is almost forgivable in this movie. admittedly, a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. however, having said that, i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because, though i have not seen the original, i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results. (my big dislike is actually sequels.) but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.people have compared this to smoky and the bandit. how about a road version of "legends of the fall" meets "thelma and louese" as well? i sure felt touches of both films(both of which i'm a fan of.) i do not think however, that this was a great film. it was better then average to me but far from great. but it was an absorbing, adrenalin fueled, touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. my vote is 7 of 10.

i have to say, i loved vanishing point. i've seen the original, and this is a pretty good remake of it. even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why i gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.as for the car, well the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (and if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged hemi, so it's possible. for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.

to start off with, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating has to be lowered already. since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski, it helps.isn't this just like the united states government though, to terrorize one of its own citizens. sounds like jason priestley's character from the movie! but it is the truth, the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife. a wife, who is in labor no less, and may not make it."there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." the words of the disc jockey.there were some great shots of scenery in this film, and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. after much consideration, i gave this film a 7.

this is a really interesting movie. it is an action movie with comedy mixed in. foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin. it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next. it was a well shot movie, the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel. kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. she plays her role well. even jamie kennedy is in this movie. it's worth seeing it you haven't seen it. it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan. it deserves more credit than it is actually given.

any movie that shows federal pigs (persons in government) to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me.alas, the script supervision and editing and even, at times, the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments.i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, loathed it. thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk.now, though, i don't remember why.i believe the two should not be compared or even connected.consider them as two different movies.rate them as two different movies.this "vanishing point" provides a rallying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is, especially the federal government."the voice" wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire: "live free or die." at one time it would have been the motto of most americans.despite its obvious flaws, "vanishing point" is a film to cheer.

i am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb. the fanboy mentality strikes again. when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying. even laughing quite a bit. this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay. i don't see how since most of fuqua's movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with. at any rate...story: alvin sanders(jamie foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense treasury agent edgar(david morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named bristol(doug hutchinson). alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. while these agents are after bristol, bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders. alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. doug hutchinson is okay as bristol. he can be over-the-top sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor. he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher: war zone. david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. even mike epps is funny as alvin's brother stevie. both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen.the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. the scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but i couldn't look away. the director went all out there so he gets points for that. plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.all in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. its never boring, its always funny and i wasn't checking my watch every minute. that should count for something. bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.ps: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... how long have you been living under a rock? i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino. but those movies aren't violent right? weirdo.
