i appreciated the photography, the textures, the colours and often, unlike one comment, the lighting. what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline.i found it often disjointed, badly edited and at times difficult to follow. my version was 110 minutes, imdb shows one at 125m. possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help. i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed. miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine, i just wanted a little more dialogue. if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one, try 'hideous kinky'with kate winslet.

this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire, well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone, and learn about the people who lived there.i enjoyed the story, characters, acting and scenes. a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece.the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it. the scenes with her and alex descas (nadir) are charming and lovely.i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating.

harem suare is the best film i saw in the year 2000. bravo ferzan ozpetek. sensually shot and stunningly portrayed, harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance, which is such a taboo in hollywood. women of all shapes, sizes, and color, populate the film. cut off from the outside world, the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousies within their ranks.

when i think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. texture, smell, color, that's how i think this movie should be judged in terms of. see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace, or the sweltering turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames, satin rustle. don't just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you.

"jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines". --- it is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book. please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness. the reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned. please read the book as is it a great source of information. i enjoyed it a lot. this book is even a taught as a text book at some universities.

this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent opus, *collapse*.diamond himself comes off as personable and caring, not just a disinterested or disengaged academic. this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to "publish or perish," as the saying goes about academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects, "why you white people got so much cargo, and we have so little?" because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community. i like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "south park's" "blame canada": "blame wheat!"

having read diamond's book, i was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'western civilization' under every rug.is diamond a little preachy ? sure. like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. he uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. we get it, after about the first 10 minutes.is diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? sure. the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes. but the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the spaniard's success against the established cultures.is he preaching *against* western civilization in any way ? nope. not a word. not to my ear. all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.in the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.

this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel more4 and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking. i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary. basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth's societies prospered and others did not. the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one. as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re-created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary. diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses. people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist. it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion. highly recommended viewing.

the documentary presents an original theory about "guns, germs and steel". the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defend the theory against common criticism.i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series. they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school. indeed, it does. in fact, i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis.so, if you like knowing why things work, if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked, if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this series. a definite recommendation.

don't know if this contains any spoilers or not, but i don't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462.i disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described *guns, germs and steel* as "politically correct" and "neo-marxist." they cannot have watched the same series that *i* did.the series *i* watched depicted the history of european colonisation in the americas and southern africa with no particular inaccuracies. i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, though europeans often *were* lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck. neither did i see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. if anything, the inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power. i certainly saw nothing that could be construed as marxist or neo-marxist, except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations.otherwise, many african peoples *do* have a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that europeans lack. at the time they were at the height of their successes, the aztec, maya and inca civilisations *were* as advanced as any other in the world - and as wealthy; sometimes more so. aboriginal american and khoi-san populations *were* decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by europeans; just as european colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (note: the khoi-san peoples are completely different from all other sub-saharan african peoples.) so, i don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. the only thing *i* can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything i did not know by the time i finished seventh grade. there's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film. it does, however, present some nice dramatisations of events, such as the conquest of the incas; the production values are very high; and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn't get covered in mrs. gruber's sixth hour social studies class at milan middle school.if you rent or buy this, assuming you had a decent primary and/or secondary school education, you won't learn anything new, but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned (or should have learned) by the time you hit high school.

this movie was beautiful. it was full of memorable imagery, good acting, and touching subject matter. it would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental, but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve. i was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation. there were a few cheesy shots, but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. the only complaint i can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details. however, this movie wasn't created to explain every element of joseph smith's life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures etc.; it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time.

i have seen this wonderful production, and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife-i am not sure of her character's name. i went to byu with her and lost touch with her-her maiden name was kim luke-and i wonder if anyone has any info on her. she is not listed in the credits. this production was outstanding, a tear-jerker on all accounts, superb acting by all. i guess i don't even want to put it in the general category of 'acting', more like 'portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final dispensation'.....something like that. if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know!!! she was fantastic in her role, by the way....thanks, melissa thorne

i think the film is educational. however, it fails to treat the issue which sparked so much controversy: plural marriage. also, the film fails to reveal what the lds church espouses. big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe. i could not get a clear idea of what it is lds views are on central topics of religion.i have many lds friends and they are nice people. would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view their prophet's more controversial statements. maybe these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of joseph smith's truly interesting life. after all, it gives insight into american thought on religion in the 18th century. hope they do some documentaries on this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on smith's life. we may have a mormon president some day. after all, smith ran for president.

i don't know what movie some of these other people watched, but they must have seen a different "joseph smith: prophet of the restoration" than the one i saw.i think the movie was both well-done and inspiring. i think it's definitely worth watching. it's apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film. the background scenery is beautiful.i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet. joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence.i would definitely recommend watching this movie.

despite reading the "initial comments" from someone who curiously disliked the film -- (why is the only negative comment very first on the list?)it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it! obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner ~ thats the whole idea. and in fact, those points were extremely effective. we already know joseph smith was human... but despite that, and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary, it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable, god-given work. i'd recommend it to anyone!

as a convert into the church of jesus christ of latter day saints, i try to absorb as much as i can of my new religion's history. i was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons & the other young men & women as well as their families of our ward. on a beautiful spring evening, we drove to kirtland, ohio to the church's historical village located there. we were to have had reservations at the vistor's center to view this movie. since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, i was intrigued. the only "full length motion pictures" of the church's i had seen was "legacy" and "my best two years", both which i thought were very well written and preformed.at the beginning, the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie. i thought "ok...but it takes a lot to move me to tears." imagine my surprise when i found myself sobbing! it truly is a very moving & inspirational testament to the prophet joseph smith.see it & believe in it's powerful message!

this film is a true and historical film. it is very useful to those researching the lds church, because it is 100% true. it is an excellent film and i recommend it.it is very factual, exciting, and motivational. there are some who think it is not factual, but it is.it is about the restoration of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints, and about the prophet, joseph smith, who restored it. it has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy, his courting emma smith, emma, his wife, giving birth, and so on. but most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church.

this movie was the best movie i have ever seen. being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith. although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart. this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. after i saw this movie,there was not a single dry eye in the entire room. everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it. i highly recommend this movie for everyone.

the most amazing, spiritually uplifting movie about the restoration of the gospel. far better than any other film, or movie made about the restoration thus far. if you haven't seen it, hop on a plane to salt lake and see it now. you won't regret it! you truly get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle through, putting complete and total faith in there prophet joseph smith. you finally get some sort of comprehension of the things the prophet had to fight through and the persecutions he and his people faced. if you have any questions about the church of jesus christ of latter-days saints and our humble beginnings just watch this movie, it will make complete and total sense afterward.

this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen. i headed up with about 150 people to st. george and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the st. george temple.. not one person had dry eyes in the audience. also, there were some non- religious and anti-mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced because of their beliefs.i recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through. after all, it is apart of american history.

this movie makes a statement about joseph smith, what he stood for, and what the lds church believes. with all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the lds church with the flds church and criminal fugitive warren jeffs. jeffs is not associated with the lds church yet media groups internationally have asked for comments about jeffs from the lds church. jeffs is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all it's points about joseph also point away from the fews of the flds church and their leader at this time in the media world. this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that. some of the most obvious differences between jeffs and joseph is portrayed in joseph's humanity, acceptance and love. jeffs views and opinions differ greatly from joseph smith and the lds church and it is seen in this movie. jeffs thinks of the "negro" as devils. joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wife's favorite horse to a african american (former slave) to buy his son's freedom. joseph is shown doing housework for his wife emma and is criticized by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing chores is a way to help and cherish your wife. jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees. lastly joseph participated with law enforcement and sought aid from the government at all times. jeffs thumbs his nose at government and flees at all times.i loved this movie and if you don't know much about joseph smith and what the lds church believes, then this is the movie to see. and if you had confused the lds church with the flds church then you really need to get your act together. we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ, the sanctity of marriage and the family, as well a patriotic to our homeland and country. we are all different as well just like you can find different protestants, presbyterians, methodist, baptist and catholics. what's important is our message and what we stand for. this movie trys to portray that but there is so much of joseph's life that can't be covered in a mere 2 hour movie. this was a really great show.

i really thought they did an *excellent* job, there was nothing wrong with it at all, i don't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible, it moved me to tears (i guess it moved about everyone to tears) but i try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing but this one got me. it was sooo good! i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy! i feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that i can't explain, it made me want to strive to be a better person, they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted, i guess. compared to that, i feel like our own trials are nothing. well, not nothing, but they hardly match what they had to go through. i loved it. who played emma?!

warning: mild spoilers.the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in american history and world religious history. this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith, whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth. i've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing.joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (alvin, hyrum & joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. the operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents.joseph's religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed. the face of jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands. the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by joseph's marriage to emma.this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. this is not a critique - simply a note about the style.the practice of tarring and feathering is shown, and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the savior's love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked.the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church, while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments.the film shows many scenes from joseph's life, including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma. an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his endless love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious sentiments, and his compassion.as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from throughout the movie, whose lives had been touched by joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful.at the end, the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed, and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed.when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non-members. i no longer think that is the case, although i hope the movie can do just that. as an insider, i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic, an epic story of an american religious man, or something else.the film is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.

i am stunned at the negative comments that i have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest. this is the most moving and real portrayal of joseph smith that i have ever seen. it was well acted to the point that at times i forgot that i was watching a movie. it brought joseph's life of hardship, good-natured optimism, enduring faith in people and god, and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe. if anyone, of any christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way--i would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and not the movie. i give the movie a "10" and encourage honest souls to view it. at the very least it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed...in a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed, this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be- no matter what religious beliefs we hold.- ann pruitt-

i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning. i'm going to assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one's level of acceptance of joseph's story.however, that aside it was very well made, well acted, and had a nice score. if you get to salt lake city, it is a must to see it in the legacy theater. i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality, sound quality and ambiance in my entire life...i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there! being that i'm lds and regard joseph as a prophet, i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times...which i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started! anyway, i'm told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe, if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.

after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent, not only in the visual beauty, the writing, music score, acting, and directing, but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path. i am very pleased, indeed, to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do.

this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time. the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie. the story was accurately portrayed. the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo, illinois. she has become a member of the lds church and he has not. he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging. she encourages him to read about joseph smith, the prophet. this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins. the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time. it was graphic at times, but was needed. the emotional expression was very believable, which caused my emotions to spill out. filming was awesome. the way in which the story was presented was touching. after the movie was over, we just sat there unable to moved. i was stunned. for people who know very little of joseph smith, the mormon prophet, i would encourage you to see this. if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life. for those who are members of the church, i would encourage you to see it. it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man. this is a must see.

gbs wrote his own screen adaptation of this nobel prize winning play but didn't live to see it produced (he had won an oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play pygmalion). when otto preminger mounted (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after shaw's death, he had noted british author graham greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice.taking a cue from shaw's own screenplay, greene uses material from the stage epilogue to create a framing device to meld the two acts of the play (one early and one late in joan's story) into a unified and most satisfying whole. where on stage the shift in tone is buffered with an intermission, here it works just as well with a return to king charles balois's bedchamber (where the man joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation), and more material from shaw's epilogue - the introduction of the shade of john gielgud's warwick (the english "king maker").the majority of the language is solid gbs, and the performances from stalwart shauvians (like felix aymler's inquisitor or harry andrews' de stogumber) to relative newcomers (the film established jean seberg's career) are first rate. it may jar some, only familiar with richard widmark's many movie villains, to see him playing a frail and somewhat silly dauphin, but the performance - oddly top billed - is professional, even if arguably miscast.the symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve shaw and the story well. go in expecting quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed.

this movie is a should-be classic. it's not perfect, certainly. the pacing, while perfect for the stage, is in movie form slow as a tortoise with arthritic knees. jean seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle. she fully shows enough acting talent, skill, and craft to convincingly play the clever, passionate, and confident joan, but, unfortunately, the director missed the point of the character. george bernard shaw is my favorite playwright. in no other play has his dialog been more sharp, nor the lines more musical. however, processing this film requires that you look at it as a lawyer. this movie is a case, and the viewer is the judge. that is how this picture is to be enjoyed. 7/10.

having seen the peter o'toole version recently, i was ready to be awed by the smart writing in this version. little time is spent on the fighting, which i prefer. instead, we are shown all the many motives underlying both the french and english (who held normandy) politicos and priests who put her to death. even the worst hypocrite of them all, the archbishop, leaves us with the thought that "of course, she was innocent. the innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty. she had no idea what she was saying, no idea of the implications of blasphemy or going against the church. unschooled, she had no idea of what the church's stand on such matters even was."preminger was true to the myths surrounding her death, and i appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her. why? they used gas jets in the movie, and 2 of them were stopped up. suddenly, the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her. thankfully for her, they didn't have to repeat the shot as it was so realistic: she was being burned!! pretty traumatic introduction for an iowa girl to her new career of acting.john gielgud performed outstandingly. he is the english politico who is orchestrating the show. he also makes the point that once you condemn someone to death, you don't want to be around to watch them die. you might shrink from your 'duty' the next time...not that such delicacies bother the soul of our would-be president. we christians, even the most anti-semitic have no problem with falling back on the old testament when it comes to capital punishment, even though it was overridden by jesus' words. bring on public executions like this little girl's. smelling burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our souls' senses.the only little 'pick' i have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so adamantly urging her burning becomes so suddenly so contrite, even to the point of madness. there should have been more expansion of his character, more dialogue--as the sudden 'coming to his senses' doesn't make sense.and, whether graham greene does this deliberately or not, st. joan is such a self-assured little upstart, you almost but not quite, are glad she meets her come-uppance. and, when she turned down life in prison, for some reason i thought of anne sexton, the poet who accused sylvia plath of 'stealing her death' when she committed suicide ...knowing such an action guarantees immortality. you gotta wonder!!if ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logic-tight compartments, this is one. st. joan should have turned buddhist and quieted the 'voices in her mind'.

preminger's adaptation of g. b. shaw's ''saint joan''(screenplay by graham greene) received one of the worst critical reactions in it's day. it was vilified by the pseudo-elite, the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant. as in ''peeping tom'', the reaction was malicious and unjustified. preminger's adaptation of shaw's intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding joan of arc(her actual name in her own language is jeanne d'arc but this film is in english) is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play, not only on the literal emotional level but formally too. his film is a brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions, the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power. as such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters, including joan herself.as played by jean seberg(whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here), she is presented as an innocent, a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone. as such seberg plays her as both saint and madwoman. her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this film(which does show up in spots) conveys the freshness and youth of jeanne revealing both the fact that jeanne la pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence. by no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film's first release, it's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience. shaw and preminger took a secular view towards joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist, not content with being a rustic daughter who's fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields. her faith, her voices, her visions which she intermingles with words such as "imagination" and "common sense" leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading englishman out of france.and yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the dauphin(richard widmark), the office of the clergy who try joan led by pierre cauchon(anton walbrook, impeccably cast) and the actions of the earl of warwick(john gielgud) then in joan herself. the superb ensemble cast(all male) portray figures of scheming, machievellian(although the story precedes niccolo) opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends. the sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose. john gielgud as the eminently rational earl whose intelligence,(albeit accompanied by corruption), allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure joan gets burnt at the stake and anton walbrook's pierre cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty. richard widmark as the dauphin is a real revelation. as against-type a casting choice you'll ever find, widmark portrays the weak future ruler of france in a frenzied, comic caricature that's as close as this film comes to comic relief. a comic performance that feels like an imitation of jerry lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of france.preminger shot ''saint joan'' in black and white, the cinematographer is georges perinal who worked with rene clair and who did ''the life and death of colonel blimp'' in colour. it's perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film. preminger's preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film, there's no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise-en-scene.it also marks the direction of preminger's most mature(and most neglected period) his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work, how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles. these themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers. this is one of his very best and most effective films.

savaged when it came out, this film now looks handsome and sounds great. a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting, from gielgud, kenneth haigh, harry andrews and especially anton walbrook,and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young jean seberg. preminger doesn't jump around and show off- his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect, and graham greene's script condenses shaw without sacrificing complexity.the piece has the look of a made for tv movie, and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that. too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down. what would mel gibson have made of the maid? many drooling shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the bbq as the flames take hold. preminger does none of this. the burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction. there are a few weak performances, but not enough to cause any serious damage. i caught this movie on tv and was not expecting to watch it through, but i was gripped . in our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, joan's story has unexpected resonance.

well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war. excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck. the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete us minds who'd probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations. real americans might appreciate the story line and the action. for all the action and intrigue, fraulein doktor compares favo(u)rably to jacob's ladder.

i remember seeing this film years ago on, i think, bbc2. i would very much like to view it again - does anyone know how i can obtain a copy? as i remember, it was an especially powerful movie, in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks. apart from that i really can't recall too much about the story - which is why i want to view it again! i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market. would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this. thanks very much in advance for your assistance. best regards, albany234@googlemail.com

this is an excellent but hard to find trippy world war i spy thriller in the inimitable 60's italian style. from the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by ennio morricone to the lesbian love scene with capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man's land battle scenes with poison gas and german cavalry in full gas proof 'storm trooper' gear, this is a movie that should not be missed. it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield. apart from the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes, but for lovers of 60's cinema it should not be an issue. i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on vhs. i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.

excellent film. suzy kendall will hold your interest throughout. has not been shown on american tv for a decade. one scene that has always stayed with me is the german cavalry gas attack. you will find others. hope they soon put it on tape.

i saw this movie once in or close to its release year 36 years ago (1969). although i can now only remember bits of it, i long to see it again. the parts i remember, rightly or wrongly, include mustard gas in the trenches and suzie kendall as a german spy, offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him. the music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of gone with the wind and i would love to hear it again. there must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. anyone know why? i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest.

like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie, i can only wonder why this has never appeared on video.i recall seeing it at about age 12 on the "the late show," circa 1972. i too recall the poison gas attack and the weirdly garbed horses. (i don't recall the more horrific bits i've seen described here; they were likely cut out for the tv audience.) but the scenes i really liked were the ones involving the death of lord kitchener aboard the hms hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. the scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really chilling, as i recall.don't recall the musical score, but the comments of the others now have me curious. get this one out on video!

luckily, not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv. and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!but i'm glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. and it's not just because of the two george's actresses.the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, and it certainly did hit me. very effective. also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. well, being a case of war, mostly bad.for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must. his work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall. talk about fräulein! let's hope they get this on dvd soon, so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.

there are movies, and there are films. movies are more often than not merely cinematic "candy," whereas films are true works of art. fraulein doktor is certainly well-placed in the latter. as most viewers, i was highly impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film. having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts. the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto, alone, desolate, and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a "spy's" lot in life. only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close. fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing. i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again)enjoy this exceptional motion picture.

fräulein doktor is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in western europe has declined in the past 40 years. then, in the late 60s, while the big hollywood studios were on the ropes, italy,france and england were turning out movies to fill the void left by hollywood's decline. there were the james bond pictures (doctor no was a surprise hit in the usa, it was first released at the century theater chain in nyc with a 99 cent afternoon admission price), the clint eastwood spaghetti westerns (with a fistful of dollars released by a distributor that never paid the italian producers a dime)and french crime movies that usually went to art houses, with exceptions like the sicilian clan. and there were european co-productions like doctor zhivago and, of course, fräulein doktor. with its big budget for the time, and the world talent involved, fräulein doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later.kenneth more, playing a british intelligence officer, has a line in fräulein doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the wall game. the wall being opposite a firing squad, with little chance of the spy winning the game. that sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders, in the vietnam war era of 1969.the steamy scenes between suzy kendall and capucine probably did not damage these performers' chances at getting parts in hollywood movies, hollywood studios were in the process of shedding their overseas distribution and production businesses. fox would no longer co-produce films like the sicilian clan, columbia wouldn't distribute films like belmondo's the night caller. mgm went even further, cutting almost all film production, selling its chain of theaters in india for the value of the land underneath and unloading its borehamwood studio facilty as kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in las vegas (where a bally casino gift shop sold mgm memorabilia at giveaway prices, stuff left over from the auction of mgm's prop warehouses).paramount distributed fräulein doktor, but gulf and western's charles bludhorn, who had taken over the company and canned the studio's aged board of directors, unloaded the studio's film library to universal (as i recall) and really became interested in movies after production chief robert evans started turning out one hit after another. but that was in the 70s. fräulein doktor with its lesbian scene was buried, with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s.kenneth more was usually typecast as a bumbling guy when he was older, especially in the bbc detective series father brown. when he was younger, as in the british movie titanic, he played his standard reserved british officer. in fräulein doktor, he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual, as i recall. it would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate, about his role and, of course, those cavalry horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle. that was some scene, and alberto lattuada showed he was some director, helming this world war i espionage movie, where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen.

it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as "dukes of hazzard" and "the hills have eyes" (the new version) can find dvd distributors while older - and far superior works such as this film - are nowhere to be found. with all the on-going debate about the morality (or lack thereof) of warfare, and interest in espionage (consider the multiple jack ryan, bourne, xxx, and "mission: impossible" productions, this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd. true, it looks like a 1968 motion picture because it is a 1968 motion picture. but style consideration aside, this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say, and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained. if nothing else, will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd, whether it be a compilation with other morricone music or as a stand-alone. i don't know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products, but if you are reading this and other comments, please take us seriously. we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets, dvds and cds - give us what we want! all that said, if you are reading this and have not seen this film, lobby for it's release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about. you will not be disappointed.

i saw this film by chance on the small box. it has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas. a lot about fanatical patriotism. a bit of eroticism. i can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes!!

i havent seen that movie in 20 or more years but i remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas-masks vividly, this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on saving private ryan, i recommend it strongly.

i saw this at the theater in the early 1970's. the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. the experienced british soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers. the gas clouds move ever closer, finally enveloping the british defenders. the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb. suddenly a scream from the defenders... this gas is like no other that they have experienced before.... now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shiver, i think that you will too!

after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller, madam lili (1969)starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon, i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller. all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis. it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor. once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back. it is, for its time, a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918.it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews! as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks. if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity.

like other people who commented on "fräulein doktor" i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night tv without having heard of it before. the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning.to me this is one of the five best movies about wwi (the others are "all quiet on the western front", "paths of glory", "gallipoli" and the post-war "la vie et rien d'autre"). and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks.i only wish i had taped the film.

a fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical renown, "artemisia" tells the true story of a young italian woman's impassioned pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters. the film features sumptuous costuming and sets and a good cast and acting. however, it is muddled in its attempt to depict the esoterics of the art and the time and is uninspired in its representation of the passion of the artist as painted on canvas and explored through her involvements with men. a good film for those interested in renaissance painting or period films.

i'm fan of art, i like anything about art, i like paintings, sculptures, etc. this movie shows it, so i like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about art, especially naked bodies, but she can't do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family didn't let her paint naked men because it's against the moral. even so artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. she falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too, so at the ending he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying. he said that he raped her, but it wasn't true. artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says that she will suffer a lot, because in the trial in which artemisia, her father and the art teacher were, somebody was hurting her artistic hands to say the truth. i think this a great movie about art, and an artistic love, it's worth watching. valentina cervi is great as artemisia, she acts very well, i also like her performance in "the portrait of a lady" as pansy osmond. 8.5/10

(spoilers?)while the historical accuracy might be questionable... (and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr.. such things are more easily excused now) i liked the art ness of it. though not really an art house film. it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time. i have two complaints. 1. it's too short. and 2. the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained.8/10quality: 10/10 entertainment: 7/10 replayable: 5/10

the film of artemisia may be considered treason, or as true artistic license. which might one aver?in documented history, artemisia gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew, and still affirmed that she was r***ed, as mary garrard and gloria steinem have eloquently affirmed.in the movie, under a different torture, she refused to condemn her lover/violator.how may a movie deviate so much from received history, yet still inform the human heart?the answer is not so hard to find. in the movie, the director and cast had filled a gaping hole in the historical record, with the power of imagination.that led to a conclusion that differs from the record.so be it. i find _both_ the record and the movie to be compelling.in both the movie and (it seems) in history, artemisia was a painter, before all else.for that vision, framed in ravishing (sic) film composition, i am truly grateful.seldom have i seen a movie that so compelled my eyes.david broadhurst

i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before. so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards. as could be expected, i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right. a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.

i thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi (artemisia gentileschi).cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time.overall i thought this film was fantastic.

the movie looked like a walk-through for "immoral study". most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about "now, who drew this penis?!" sounded a bit gratuitous. dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful, albeit visually this movie got its moments. i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises. highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while.

this is a film about 17th century italian artists and one artist in particular, a woman artemisia, an unheard of profession for females at that time, and she dared to paint the male nude detailing his unique musculature.the camera work is principally indoors for that is where the artists mainly worked. there are some great shots. close-ups by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical painters and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding brushing in details of religious frescoes. it is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes,faces, make-up) are quite superbly authentic because the italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. the beautiful artemisia is urged by her father to study under the great florentine artist, tassi, who has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new) but the unsuspecting artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting. after posing for her, tassi violently rapes her. her father is outraged. court proceedings follow.this romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. the outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. scenes such as women running across a field with the wind billowing their voluminous clothing add wonderful effects.artemisia says she paints to please herself; her father paints to please others. as for this film, it will please most, i think.

i'm normally a sucker for romantic films which are well-filmed and well-acted out. this is a romantic (period) film set in 17th-century italy, but filmed in french with english subtitles. the fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower-paced than films set in the modern day era, so it will bore some. if you can overlook that fact, it is actually a really good film. the scenery, the costumes, and the cinematography are beautiful, and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals, projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot. the story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending. its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real-life characters. in spite of the fact that i was really moved by the main characters and the storyline, i decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie's story - that of an sad unfinished love story - was completely fabricated. in real life, artemisia was raped by tassi initially, rather than submitting to his advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed. she continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her. when they were in court, he had *not* admitted guilt of rape out of pity for artemisia's torture (unlike what the movie portrays). in reality, he had tried to portray artemisia as a loose, promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges. in the movie, his sister testified in court that tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister-in-law, and tassi's character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister-in-law (although he admits to having had a wife back in florence). needless to say, in reality it wasn't really like that at all. in fact, far from it. tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife, whom he had begotten from rape. and to add to that, tassi really had sexual relations with his sister-in-law, impregnating her in the process, but all this wasn't really mutual as well - again, he had raped his sister-in-law before. so now we have a clear picture of the real tassi as a multiple sex offender, what do we make of the film artemisia's portrayal of him as a lover? we take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film... that this film was never made to be historically accurate... apart from these points just mentioned, there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of artemisia's art (in real-life, she was never really influenced by tassi's painting style, and she was actually considered a much better painter than tassi ever was.) one thing remains true and its the fact that artemisia gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history, and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers, she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman, in 17th century italy.enjoy this film for its own sake, for it is a pretty good romantic drama, but take its historical references with a grain of salt.

artimisia was on late last night. at first i didn't think i would like it, but seeing i didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. her romance with the older tassi envoked recognisable feelings. even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality, i loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama's. great play, great camerashots, great music and texts. i loved it and i want more of it! :-)

artemisia gentileschi, the daughter of orazio gentileschi, showed an early promise as a painter. taught by her father, artemisia was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side art created by men. her tragic life is chronicled in this biographic film directed and co-written by agnes merlik.having read the novel "the passion of artemisia" by susan vreeland, made us investigate more into the life of this woman, her work, and her legacy. we also read mary garrard's "artemisia gentileschi", which should be a must read book by all art lovers."artemisia" presents the fictionalized facts we have read about showing the early life of the young woman as she starts to paint. she was clearly influenced by the work of her father, by caravaggio, agostino tassi, and other florentine painters of that period. her relationship and love affair with tassi is the basis of the film. artemisia, unfortunately couldn't go as far as she could have because of the prejudice against women in the arts. it didn't help either she caused a scandal where she is accused of being raped by tassi. she had to go to rome in order to distance herself from that unhappy time of her life.valentina cervi makes a beautiful artemisia. she is a gorgeous creature who awakened passion in men. michel serrault plays orazio, her father. miki maojlovic is seen as tassi, the man who wanted artemisia, but ended up in jail. emmanuelle devos appears for a moment.the film has a glossy finish that the camera work of benoit delhomme captures in all its splendor. the scenic locales of the film offer an idea of what inspired that school of painting to show in their canvases. the music by krishna levy serves well what we see. agnes merlik directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own.

this period melodrama is one of griffith's earliest claustrophobic films. characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and, as time went by, he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror. in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line, in that there truly is no escape.griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways. first is his use of space. while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets, the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms  the king's court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb. the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced, but here it is crucial. the court is a large interior, with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase. actors enter and leave from various directions, suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open. by contrast the dove cote's back wall is very close to the camera, and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined.the second technique on display here is the cross-cutting. anyone with an interest in griffith's work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross-cutting to build excitement or tension. many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn't his invention. however what makes griffith's cross-cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other. the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean. the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow, step-by-step pace to them, with tension building as the wall gets higher. this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers, in which marion leonard tears off flower petals one-by-one. as the couple realise their predicament, their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall.at this point, griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross-cut. the dramatic "ride-to-the-rescue", here absent, was later to become a standard climax to griffith's pictures.

by 1909, d.w. griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year, and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker. 'the sealed room' is a very interesting 11 minute short, a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror. the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poe's 1846 short story, "the cask of amontillado," and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wife's infidelity.set in medieval times, 'the sealed room' begins with the king (arthur v. johnson) overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dove-cote, the idea being that he and his wife (marion leonard) will have a completely private place to enjoy each other's company. he is obviously very much in love with her, always showing his affection, this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment. however, unbeknownst to the king, his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel (henry b. walthall). during one romantic liaison inside the specially-built room, the wife and the minstrel are discovered, and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple. silently, he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar, slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed down.d.w. griffith always had an eye for acute detail, and 'the sealed room' is an excellent early example of this. the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality, and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable. at the time, the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense, and i must admit that, as the film progressed, i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers. in the early minutes, griffith restricts his shots to lengthy long-takes from a stationary camera (as was usual at the time), but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way. though he may not have invented the technique, griffith was crucial in popularising the use of "cross-cutting"  that is, alternating between different events occurring at the same time. not only does this create a sense of continuity, but it also maximises the level of suspense, since we, as the audience, are well aware, not only of the king's ghastly actions, but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it all.despite these innovations, 'the sealed room' suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era. the entire film takes place in just two rooms, with footage captured from a total of just three positions, and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times. the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect, however, at least in the case of arthur v. johnson, his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king. a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room, only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone. their panicked reactions, accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king, serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia. i did think, however, that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly.

this early biograph short was so much fun to watch. the second on disc one of d.w. griffith's "years of discovery" dvd set (highly recommended) it features three excellent performances by the main leads, and interesting to see henry b. walthall (the little colonel, birth of a nation) as a campy musician giving a countess the eye (and other things).the countess' husband goes berserk at his wife's betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour. it's kind of incredible that they wouldn't hear the wall going up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. here mr. johnson (father of silent player raymond hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. the best moment comes at the end. as the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes she's doomed, henry picks up his instrument and "fans" it over her. the way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and i just lost it, and laughed my head off. the expression on his face! from that moment i was charmed by henry b. walthall.

had this movie been made a few years later, i would have given it a lower score. however, for 1909, this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today. just don't try to compare this silent film to later silents--the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century don't look at all like movies made in the 1910s and beyond.this movie is 11 minutes long (about average for most films back then) and is a variation of the edgar allen poe story, the cask of amontillado. while many are familiar with the story, i won't elaborate further as i don't want to ruin the film. just suffice to say that it's very creepy!!

after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century, in 1908 playwright d.w. griffith got the job that would make him a legend: he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies. it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business, but he accepted the job, and in less than a year he became biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative. many years later, he would direct "the birth of a nation" in 1915, the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors; however, a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career. 1909's "the sealed room" is one of those, and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century."the sealed room" is a story set in the 16th century in which a count (arhtur v. johnson) has built a windowless room in his castle. it is a small yet nice and very cozy room, as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife, the countess (marion leonard) in a more private way. however, the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful, as she is infatuated with the minstrel (henry b. walthall) at court, with whom she is having an affair. as soon as the count gets busy with his own business, the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count's new room. when the count returns, he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect, finally discovering the two lovers in his room; but instead of making a scene, he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife: to seal the windowless room with the couple inside.written by griffiths' regular collaborator frank e. woods, "the sealed room" takes elements from edgar allan poe's "the cask of amontillado" and mainly honoré de balzac's "la grande breteche" to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism. despite having a runtime of 11 minutes, woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way, and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story. while a melodrama at heart, woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era. "the sealed room" is definitely a very simple and basic story, but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith's melodramas.in "the sealed room", griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual. while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience, in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror, playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had. it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot, culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes. not being a movie where camera tricks are essential, what shines the most in "the sealed room" is griffith's talent to direct his actors, as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day.as usual, the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith, starting with arthur v. johnson as the count. johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster. his performance is not without a touch of overacting, but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality. as the countess, marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting, conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery. finally, the legendary henry b. walthall appears as the handsome minstrel, and while far from being one of his best performances, he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film. while not of real importance to the plot, it's nice to see other members of griffith's stock company in the background, like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court.while not exactly a masterpiece, "the sealed room" is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days. the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget, griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style. the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era, and johnson's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch. while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential (and controversial) "the birth of a nation", the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend. simple yet elegant, "the sealed room" is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century. 7/10

excellent p.o.w. adventure, adapted by eric williams from his own book (a paperback copy of which forms part of my father's library) that was inspired by true events; it may well be the first film of its kind and, therefore, has a lot to answer for  not just similarly stiff-upper-lipped examples such as albert, r.n. (1953; which i'll be watching presently), the colditz story (1955) and danger within (1959) but higher-profile releases from the other side of the atlantic, namely stalag 17 (1953) and the great escape (1963). this, then, sets the basis pretty solidly: british soldiers interned in a german camp devise an ingenious plan of escape, borrowing a page from greek legend  burrowing from under a vaulting horse used during physical exercise and in full view of their captors! actually, the film is neatly split into two halves: the first deals with the slow process of digging the tunnel, culminating in the escape itself, while the latter stages depict their fortunes outside the camp as they try to make it to neutral sweden. typically of these british films, the cast showcases several established (leo genn), current (anthony steel) and up-and-coming (peter finch, david tomlinson and bill travers) stars, to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors (anthony dawson, bryan forbes, michael goodliffe and walter gotell). the three leads/escapees are genn, steel and tomlinson: while the first two stick together, the latter goes his own way  only to run into the others on reaching safety. as can be expected, the narrative involves plenty of suspense and excitement; as with most male-centered p.o.w. sagas, too, female interest is kept to the barest minimum. director lee didn't have a lengthy career  with this and the somewhat similar (albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint) a town like alice (1956) his most noteworthy achievements  but he certainly milked every gripping situation in this case (even if, reportedly, delays in filming saw lee quitting his post prematurelyleaving producer ian dalrymple with the task of tying up loose ends!). anyway, worth special mention is the exquisite lighting (particularly during night-time sequences) throughout.

this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war (pow) camp, stalag luft iii, during the second world war. this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the gestapo (and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name). while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as tom, dick & harry), two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing 'classic' attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap-frog in the compound.initially containing one, and later with two pows hidden inside, the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position, near the fence, on a daily basis. while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse, the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire, under the wire, and into the woods. the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel. all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs (escaped successfully to their home base.). the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout. the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape. made with far less a budget than the great escape, the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape. the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie. the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, eric williams, and is, by far, the best pow escape story ever made into a movie. some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii. i give this movie a well deserved ten.

playing out as a sort of pre runner to the great escape some 13 years later, this smashing little british film plays it straight with no thrills and dare do well overkill. first part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists, whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach sweden. the film relies on pure characters with simple, effective, and yes, believable dialogue to carry it thru, and it achieves its aims handsomely. no little amount of suspense keeps the film ticking along, and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it adheres to, so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type ?.7/10

while thinking of "the great escape" i allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood. i had read and re-read the autobiographical novel from 1949 which inspired it, and when it came to the only cinema (we never used that word then , actually) in town that showed "foreign" films, i was first in line to buy my ticket.as someone brought up on wartime newsreels and propaganda films during wwii, i had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the memoirs and stories of men who were there in person. that extended later to a keen willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject, and eventually to read the equally compelling novels of hans helmut kirst and erich maria remarque, which provided an even deeper sensibility. the movie versions, however, were unlike this one in that they rarely delivered the goods.the medium of black-and-white film has never been served so well as it was in those years. i have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as do the deep chiaroscuros of films like "the wooden horse." if it is true that we are destined always to be captive to the images of our childhood, then i confess it freely.and there will never be another the likes of leo genn as the emblematic british war hero on film. not even sir alec.

the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british pow's during world war ii. it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues leo genn. anthony steele and david tomlinson (later george banks in mary poppins) are marvelous as the two heroes. the direction is taut and fast-moving throughout. highly recommended.

the wooden horse was one of the first "great" escape stories from world war ii, telling the true story of eric williams and others in their escape from stalag-lufft iii in october of 1943. i really like this film, but had to by it on vhs from amazon in england and get it transferred from pal format in the u.s. i read the book when i was in hight school, after having seen a portion of the film in the early 60's on t.v. the taunt drama of peter and john trying to escape from germany during the war is more realistic than the treck of the escapes portrayed in the great escape. this film is a lost treasure, that should be made more available to american audiences.

in 1943, a group of raf officers, including eric wiiliams, decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard. in 1950, it was decided to film his account, and it kick-started a peculiar british film genre- the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within (1959).the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched. there are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama, jump cuts or jacked up (somethings about to happen!) music. it is utterly of its time and works beautifully.leo glenn, anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (i suspect) non-actors. without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. they keep emotion out of their roles. as so many were, until recently, ex-service, i suspect they recreated their war time roles as 'officers and gentlemen'.this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. on the contrary, unlike most wartime escape films, the story doesn't end at the barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end.

this unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a pow escape during ww ii. the performances are incredible, especially anthony steele. the movie works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal. the dialogue is ingenious and rings very true. in fact, an unusual all-around authenticity puts this one head-and-shoulders above most war epics.

i enjoyed watching brigham young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith. i think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early mormon church. it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people.as a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of brigham young as one that had "knowingly deceived" church members into believing he had been called to be joseph's successor as the prophet. although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church. brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration. the point is important for mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith: that god truly speaks to prophets today, and that brigham young, like joseph smith, was an inspired prophet of god.whether or not you believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what brigham himself believed.

this is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the mormons and their final settlement in salt lake, utah. the beginning and the ending are especially powerful, and the message is one we all have to be reminded of - god doesn't talk, but he communicates, if we would only listen. as i am writing this in the midst of the horrors going on in new orleans and the surrounding area due to katrina, i was especially moved by the mormons having to leave everything behind and move on after joseph smith was assassinated. people came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. the struggle of the mormons to cross the country, the cost in lives, the hardship they suffered was truly awe-inspiring, demonstrating their tremendous strength. as far as the actual beliefs of mormons, this is not heavily gone into, and polygamy is mentioned but is not a centerpiece of the film at all.the cast is top-notch, though others who have commented know more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the portrayals were. but as actors, dean jagger, mary astor, brian donlevy, john carradine, jane darwell all do excellently with the script they were given.though the film could have easily stood on its own (and certainly does today) tyrone power and linda darnell were added to the cast to get the crowds into the movie theaters to see a film about the mormons. power is magnificently handsome as a young mormon, and darnell, as zina, is not a mormon but stays on with the family after her father is killed. power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when he has a big scene, and darnell (still a teenager at the time of the filming) has even less, though they make a lovely couple. their fate is left unclear regarding her conversion, and one does wonder about the polygamy in their case. you can't beat either one for eye candy, however.

i find alan jacobs review very accurate concerning the movie;however i had the opportunity to rent the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from byu's curator, motion picture archives james d'arc. the then lds prophet heber j. grant approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events. for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial. despite brigham young's great oratory in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway. then joseph was killed. historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything. brigham young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial. joseph smith and his brother hyrum where both killed before the trial took place.

henry hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days in us history. however, to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about brigham young and the mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film. in my opinion, hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a mormon people were in the early history of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of joseph smith to the date of film release. in often subtle filming and dialog delivery, he covered mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes.i remember watching this movie on many saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950's. that was just over 10 years after the films release and before the los angeles temple was completed, which i watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who mormons were. i recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that hathaway interpreted in his film.1. love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. charity to those in need or not, 3. family is high in importance, 4. listen respectfully and carefully, because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. work hard, both individually and in community, 6. prepare and store for future days of need, 7. hope is a binding link to a higher being, and for our daily lives, 8. and, that there is a unique quality to any group, and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial.

i rented this film because of my interest in american history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons. this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his "vision" into a major world religion. it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo, illinois. it portrays the trial of joseph smith. within the course of that trial, brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith. then smith is assassinated, and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land. despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.i found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised. the issue is not emphasized.i'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.

fox's epic telling of one a america's greatest pioneering efforts comes to dvd with some truly outstanding "extras". brigham young (the "frontiersman" was added for the european release), telling the story the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration brought members of the mormon faith (church of jesus christ of latter-day saints)out to the salt lake valley in 1847, after mobs murdered their prophet/leader, joseph smith (played by vincent price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as america was about to enter world war ii. it was a daring move on fox chief, darryl f. zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen. now fox, working with james d'arc, curator of the excellent motion picture archives at brigham young university in provo, utah, has brought this film to the dvd format in an outstading edition. mr. d'arc, who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film, has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a dvd. he seperates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why this films was so much appreciated by church leaders even though embellishments to the truth run throughout the film. one of the fun bits of information deals with dean jagger, the actor who plays the title role. many years after the film he married a latter-saint woman and was eventually converted to the lds faith. there is much to be learned from d'arc's knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the dvd! there are over 100 pictures from the fox & byu archives included on the disc, plus newsreel footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in salt lake city. thanks fox for another outstanding dvd -- and thank you, james d'arc for your great commentary!

walking with cavemen, hosted by alec baldwin, is a look back at all the hominid (that's us!) species of the past 5 million years: who they were, what they were like, and how they died out. along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species, walking with cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human. i waited several weeks to watch this, and i was not disappointed.

gregory peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. the last 15 minutes (or thereabouts) are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch. the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film. it's not awful and i'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if i were to be honest) to see it is peck. for the rest you are better off just reading the old testament.

other than susan hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made. henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes, and peck is, as always, impeccable. the stirring alfred newman sound score, with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years. the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made. this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day, "the song of ruth" and "esther and the king." it is worth watching, and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan. the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol, david's estranged first wife.

this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950's and '60's. but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves. the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer. this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws.the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as david's second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba. hayward is at her best in this film. her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here. she is ever the seductress, but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her.raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet. as a child when i first saw the film, massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight. no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like "the robe" and "the greatest story ever told" along with perhaps 100 other films too! the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film. henry king, a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeon-holed himself into any one genre, pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and david's own deep struggle with his faith in god. the path tread in this film could have been very hokey, but king keeps it real and interesting all the way. plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god, just as david himself is struggling with the same. from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction. david is not satisfied with nathan's answer, (to paraphrase)that no one can understand the will of god. this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself.finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david. his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms. this is one of his best performances.i don't see this movie on television much anymore, but when i do i never fail to watch it. i think it still holds up very well today.

watching david&bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school. despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining. the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for. peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba, susan hayward. raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance. look for the silent screen star francis x. bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer. hooray for the old testament and hollywood.

david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of 20th century fox by darryl f. zanuck, directed by henry king and starring gregory peck {king david}, susan hayward (bathsheba), raymond massey (nathan), kieron moore (uriah) and jayne meadows (michal).the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible. it follows king david, who as a child had slain the giant goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel. a tough and assured king, david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems. for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower {re;bath}, it 's the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon.typically for the genre, david & bathsheba is a large, grandiose production. from its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous technicolor photography {leon shamroy}, it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values. untypically, tho, the film is sedately paced and relies on 99% of its worth being driven purely by dialogue. this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle. this is a very humanist picture, in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here, it's a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart. but that is no bad thing at all, because breaking it down we find it's very well acted {peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well & hayward is pushing it to the max}, and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king. and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing, the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne's (the ghost and mrs. muir) oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout.sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical/swords & sandals genres (most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point), but really it's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres. 7/10

i've always believed that david and bathsheba was a film originally intended for tyrone power at 20th century fox, although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david, the monarch with a wandering eye.a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what god expects from his followers.when you're a king, even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us. king david has many wives, including one really vicious one in jayne meadows who was the daughter of saul, david's predecessor. but his eyes catch sight of bathsheba out in her garden one evening. turns out she's as unhappily married to uriah the hittite as david is to quite a few women. uriah is one of david's army captains. david sends for bathsheba and him being the king, she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too.what happens, an affair, a pregnancy, and a carefully arranged death for uriah in a battle. but an all seeing and knowing deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing david and bathsheba, but the entire kingdom of israel is being punished with drought, disease, and pestilence.the sexist law of the day calls for bathsheba to have a stoning death. david shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him. he even lays hands on the ark of the covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film.my interpretation of it is that god admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on david and forgives them both. bathsheba becomes the mother of solomon and she and david are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of israel and judah until they're both conquered.susan hayward is a fetching bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with uriah played by kieron moore. the only thing that gets moore aroused is a good battle. i liked kieron moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear. no one can lay the law down like raymond massey. his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films, same intensity. so when his own law called for death, why did god spare bathsheba and keep david on the throne. maybe it was the fact he just didn't want to train a third guy for the job. he'd replaced saul with david already. but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament forthcoming, that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently. i'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations.watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory.

there's no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba  "i was quite a hand with a slingshot," "the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy" (full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face), "go and sit with the concubines." and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan "whatever you say." he even tries the old "my kingdom doesn't understand me" routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point. so it's probably a tribute to henry king's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide. maybe it's the censor-baiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it!  but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum. this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope, abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands, and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty. it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law, where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives.unlike king david, which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul, david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan's death, gregory peck's performance grows in stature as david shrinks. susan hayward is pure hollywood pro, raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet (why be naturalistic when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake?) and kieron moore's uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame david for putting him in harm's way, but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death. with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s biblical epics.fox's new dvd is a good transfer, including an incredibly hokey 'candid' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene.

to me movies and acting is all about telling a story. the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best. to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel, made this story all the more compelling. you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life. susan hayward's fear, reluctance, but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her. one could also feel david's anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle. raymond massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. the sets were real enough, and the atmosphere believable. all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it's kind. i gave it a rating of ten.

old movie buffs will know why i'd call this one "the man in the grey flannel robe." most bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how peck, tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying neanderthals all about him. as a great romance, it falls flat as unleavened bread. but there is something gripping about this movie. of all the big hollywood bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average american towards belief in the biblical god. billy sunday's thesis is duking it out with h.l. mencken's antithesis all through the script. who gets the better of it in the heavenly chorus-backed synthesis depends on your point of view. other than that, d & b boasts a good performances by peck ( especially in the closing repentance scene) and by jayne meadows as his bitter first wife michol, vivid, moody atmosphere (good idea to set most action at dawn or night), and the rousing rendition of the twenty-third psalm at the end.

this film is famous for several qualities: a literate script, for once in partly-religious film-making, by philip dunne, some very good performances, a first-rate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king. if one were making a film, then getting such talents as leon shamroy as cinematographer, lyle wheeler as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production. add the cast of this film, including gregory peck and susan hayward as the title characters, james robertson justice, raymond massey, kieron moore, jayne meadows and john sutton plus a dance by gwen verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special. but in a biblical subject script, usually a sub-genre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions, everything would ultimately depend on the author's skills. philip dunne here has supplied human beings, a rare achievement in biblical films. david is a man in this film, many-sided, not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament. gregory peck makes him curious, passionate, self-controlled, self-deprecating and appealing. as bathsheba, hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common-sense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her. the rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns. the familiar storyline provides them little to work with, but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations. david's youth is told in flashback; how he was chosen by a prophet of yahweh to be king of israel, and earns his way to be second to the king, saul, by defeating goliath the phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior. thereafter, he finally is driven from the court of king saul of israel, becomes a famous warrior, and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of jonathan, the king's son, formerly a friend. his wars are successful-- the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene; but his life is empty since his wife michal, jayne meadows, is saul's daughter and is cold to him. he turns to bathsheba, whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked; later she admits she had hoped he would see her. but she has a husband, uriah; when she becomes pregnant, it becomes necessary for uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home; he instead asks david to set him in the forefront of the battle, even after being aroused by verdon's dance. david agrees. he is killed, a war hero; but this does not solve the infidelity question. drought comes to israel, and the king's infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon. at last, david places his hands on the ark of the covenant, recently brought to jerusalem and housed in a temple, which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it, inviting his god to punish him--and nothing happens...david exits the temple, and finds that rain has come to his parched land. this film is always interesting, varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful. the director and author make use of the observer principle, and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the grecianized- near eastern canon, wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures. . well-remembered for its glowing realization, fine performances and intelligent dialogue, this dramatic effort bears repeated study.

to some, this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation... others see it as a story of grace, restoration, and hope... it is actually both  henry king illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin, and his upward climb of healing..'david and bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity... henry king handles the powerful story, taken from the old testament, with skill...david, 'the lion of judah,' having stormed the walls of rabgah, saves the life of one of his faithful warriors uriah (kieron moore), and returns to jerusalem... back at his court, his first wife complains of neglect, and offends him for being a shepherd's son, distinguishing herself for being the daughter of king saul...one evening, and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood, david's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath... she was beautiful and attractive... david could not take his eyes off her... he finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers... sending for her, he discovers that she, too, is unhappy in her marriage... by this point, it's apparent that david's intentions shift from an interest in taking bathsheba as a wife, to just plain taking bathsheba... as usual, sin had its consequences, and david hadn't planned on that possibility...when a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine, david suspects that the lord is punishing him and his people for his sin... but when bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of moses, david tries to cover up his sin... he sends word to joab, the commander of his army, and ordered him to send to him bathsheba's husband... david did something that was abominable in god's sight... he sends the man to the front line where he would be killed... the soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way, david marries his beloved bathsheba in full regal splendor...god punishes the couple when bathsheba's child dies soon after birth... meanwhile, a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the israelites - led by nathan - blame the king for their plight... they storm the palace and demand that bathsheba pays for her sin...peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity.. hayward as bathsheba, is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery... the sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in biblical film history, is badly mishandled, and the viewers eyes are led briefly to hayward's face and shoulders...raymond massey appeared as nathan the prophet, sent by god to rebuke david after his adultery with bathsheba; gwyneth verdon is queen michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to david's personality and kingship; ex-silent screen idol, francis x. bushman, had a brief part as king saul... the best moments of the film were: the ark en route to its permanent home when god breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object; the defining moment in david's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death; and for the film's climax, inserting it as a flashback, david remembering his fight with the giant goliath... with superb color photography and a masterly music score, 'david and bathsheba' won oscar nominations in the following categories: music scoring, art and set direction, cinematography, story and screenplay, and costume design..

macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great mangeneral douglas macarthur. this is of course, the story of one of america's great military figures, and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory. though there is a continuity issue (there may be others) e.g. macarthur's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the u.s. military academy on accepting the thayer award did not contain the phrase "old soldiers never die; they just fade away." (that was in his speech to congress upon his dismissal by president truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not see eye to eye!) gregory peck is im-peck-able as the general who vowed he would return to the philippines in world war ii. the film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career. this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war. nevertheless, peck's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed. "in war there is no substitute for victory."

name just says it all. i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man. the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the man's life - interestingly enough the man's entire life would have made such an epic bio-pic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for production.some posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man, which are cheap shots. the theme of the movie "duty, honor, country" are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a high-brassed officer - it is the deep declaration of one man's total devotion to his country.ironically peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man. he does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man.

the movie "macarthur" begins and ends at gen. douglas macarthur's, gregory peck, alma mata the us military academy of west point on the hudson. we see a frail 82 year old gen.macarthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor it is to serve their country. the film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on gen. macarthur's brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of wwii on the besieged island of corregidor in the philippines in the early spring of 1942.told to leave he island for australia before the japanese military invade it gen. macarthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior us president franklin d. roosevelt, dan o'herlihy. feeling that he'll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need macarthur reluctantly, together with his wife and young son, did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war. it was that reason, his escape under fire from death or captivity by the japanese, that drove gen. macarthur to use all his influence to get fdr two years later to launch a major invasion of the philippians, instead of the island of formosa, to back up his promise to both the philippine people as well as the thousands of us pows left behind. that he'll return and return with the might of the us army & navy to back up his pledge!in the two years up until the invasion of the philippine islands gen. macarther battered the japanese forces in the south pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of japanese troops into surrender. the general did that suffering far less us military losses then any other allied commander in the war in the pacific! it was in 1950/51 in the korean war that gen. macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. after outflanking the advancing north korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed, with the invading us marines suffering less then 100 casualties, back door or left hook invasion of inchon gen. macarther feeling invincible sent the us/un forces under his command to the very border, along the yalu river, of communist red china. told by his subordinates that he's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by communist chinese troops gen. macarthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the us & un forces to ribbons. the unstoppable wave after wave of attacking red chinese troops forced the us/un forces to retreat in the "big bug out" of 1950 with their very lives, leaving all their equipment behind, across the north korean border even abandoning the south korean capital city of seoul! this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record, in the korean war, 1,000 lives on the very first day-nov. 29/30 1950-of the communist chinese invasion!shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, due mostly to his own arrogance, to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist chinese and noth koreans forces but his own commander and chief pres. harry s. truman, ed flanders, in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done: launch a full scale invasion of communist china with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the korean peninsula! for pres. truman who had taken just about enough garbage from gen. macarthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out, like macarthur wanted him to, against the red chinese this was the last straw! on april 11, 1951 pres. truman unceremoniously relived gen. macarthur from his command as supreme commander of the us/un forces in korea! pres. truman's brave but very unpopular decision also, by not going along with macarthur's total war strategy, prevented a third world war from breaking out with the soviet union-communist china's ally- who at the time-like the us-had the atomic bomb! pres. truman''s controversial decision to dump the very popular gen. macarthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his polls numbers so low-in the mid 20's- that he withdrew-in march of that year- from the us presidential campaign!in was gen. macarthur's misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars. with the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out, like gen. macarthur wanted to, against the red chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the us ussr & red china but the entire world! it was that important reality of future war that gen. macarthur was never taught, since the a and h bomb weren't yet invented, in west point.back to 1962 we can now see that gen. macarthur, after finishing his commencement speech at west point, had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as , since his retirement from the us military, elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it. one thing that gen. macarthur was taught at an early age, from his civil war general dad douglas macarthur sr, that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last-not first-resort in settling issues between nations. in that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. it took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, for gen. macarthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a congressional medal of honor winner, like himself, really was!

since douglas macarthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other american not elected president, he deserved a better film biography. not that universal's "macarthur" is bad. it's just not all it should have been.oddly enough, the potential was there. from the very early "star trek" episode "the corbomite maneuver" (1966) to the recent hbo films "something the lord made" (2oo4) and "warm springs" (2oo5), director joseph sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film, a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances, and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go. the producer, frank mccarthy, also gave us "patton" (197o), the legendary jerry goldsmith scored both films, and universal widely touted the fact that the film was "four years in preparation and production." yet for all of this, "macarthur" is perfectly adequateand not much more than that.the film begins in early 1942, shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby president franklin d. roosevelt (dan o'herlihy)to flee the philippines to avoid capture by the japanese. thus, this film omits: · macarthur's birth in 188o in a frontier barracks in arkansas still subject to attack by native american tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows-and-arrows to thermonuclear weapons; · his graduation from west pointfirst in a class of 95, · how he joined his famous father, general arthur macarthur (who had earned the medal of honor at missionary ridge in the civil war) on assignments in japan, china and, most importantly, in the philippines; · his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into vera cruz; · how he leaped about the trenches of world war one like a mountain goat, often wounded, and promoted with blinding speed to brigadier general; · his postwar service as west point's youngestand most progressivecommandant; · his participation in the court-martial of billy mitchell in 1924; · his routing of the bonus marchers in 1932; · his efforts to sustain a woefully-underfunded army as chief of staff in the early 193o's; · his retirement from the u.s. army to become field marshal (!) of the army of the philippines; · and the reactivation of his commission by fdr shortly before the outbreak of the second world war.all this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of macarthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by pt boatthus, we know that "general mac" is a legend, but not why; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to "dugout doug"and so patently unfounded.the remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly: his island-hopping "hit 'em where they ain't" campaign, the fulfillment of his pledge to the filipinos "i shall return!"his crowning achievement, the winning of the peace in postwar japan, then the difference of opinion with president harry truman (a properly feisty ed flanders) over the conduct of the korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing, and finally, his proclamation to congress that "old soldierssimply fade away," after which he did just that. all quite historically accurate, and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary.sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: if macarthur's actions appear noble, let them be presented as such; if they appear egotistical or bombastic, let those conceptions register sans comment. since joe sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsagain, see warm springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional. historically, that may be commendable, but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective.and finally, there is a sort of "made on the cheap" feel to the film, as there is to "midway," released about the same time. both films were relegated to "television" directors--sargent in this case, jack smight on "midway," and both have a made-for-tv-look. even jerry goldsmith's march, while perfectly serviceable, lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his "patton" theme--just another way in which a larger-than-life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film.there was vanity and pettiness in this man, inarguably; there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him, one must acknowledge the fact that macarthur did what no military commander before him had done: he won the peace.in the end, "macarthur"like so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man, but a poor place to end it.

frank mccarthy who produced the academy award winning biographical film patton follows it up with a strong tribute to another of america's fighting generals, douglas macarthur. gregory peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his egotism. with macarthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended.the whole story of douglas macarthur would be a six hour film or a tv mini-series. it would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at west point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. it would talk about his service in the phillipines as a young officer, his legend building bravery on the battlefields of world war i in france. it would also have to tell about him firing on the bonus marchers of world war i veterans in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on any chances president herbert hoover had of getting re-elected. during macarthur's last years he and hoover had penthouse suites at the waldorf astoria in new york city. that must have been a subject they avoided.this film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback. the film opens with macarthur addressing the student body in 1962. as he speaks the words of the famous duty honor country speech, macarthur's mind goes back to world war ii and his desperate struggle against the advancing japanese on the island of corregidor and the fields of bataan on luzon. the film takes him through his struggle to win back the phillipines, the occupation of japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by president truman.macarthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of dan o'herlihy and ed flanders as presidents franklin d. roosevelt and harry s. truman respectively. it's the part of the film i enjoyed the best, seeing macarthur and his relations with both these men.fdr by o'herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd president. roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness. sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake, but he was the master politician of the last century. note how he deals with macarthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time.truman by flanders is as people remember him, a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked macarthur's haughtiness from the gitgo. of course it's in the history books how truman relieved macarthur in 1951 for insubordination. macarthur was insubordinate, no doubt about it.yet i could write a whole thesis on the truman-macarthur relations. along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis. i've always felt that fdr would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then.macarthur was also grandly eloquent and gregory peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. listen to peck at the japanese surrender, at macarthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree.

gregory peck's brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of corregidor in the philippines at the start of the pacific war largely through to his removal as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities. certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war (and possibly ever) macarthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions. he claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace, yet he obviously glories in war; he consistently denies any political ambitions, yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate; he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter, yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states; he shows great respect for other cultures (particularly in the philippines and japan) and yet is completely out of touch with his own country. all these things are held in balance throughout this movie, and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man, although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and passionately loved his country, and especially the army he devoted his life to.peck's performance was, as i said, brilliant - to the point, actually, of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film (which is perhaps appropriate, given who he was portraying!) with the possible exception of ed flanders. i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur: sarcastic (repeatedly referring to macarthur as "his majesty,") angry, frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply won't respect his authority as president. marj dusay was also intriguing as macarhur's wife jean, devoted to her husband (whom she herself referred to as "general," although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one.) i very much enjoyed this movie, although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about macarthur's early life. i have always chuckled at macarthur's reaction to eisenhower being elected president ("he'll make a fine president - he was the best damn clerk i ever had" - which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be, especially to his military commanders during wartime.) well worth watching. 8/10

it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film, whereas `patton- lust for glory', producer frank mccarthy's earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war, has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments. like a previous reviewer, i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other.one difference between the two films is that `patton' is more focused, concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war, whereas `macarthur' covers not only this war but also its subject's role in the korean war, as well as his period as american governor of occupied japan during the interlude.the main difference, however, lies in the way the two leaders are played. gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c. scott dominated `patton'. whereas scott had another major star, karl malden, playing opposite him as general bradley, none of the other actors in `macarthur' are household names, at least for their film work. scott, of course, portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery-tempered, a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race, not just with the enemy. i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton, but that is not how he appears in this film. peck's macarthur is of a more reflective, thoughtful bent, comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films. at times, he even seems to be a man of the political left. much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid-up member of cnd, and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi-socialist air to them. in an attempt to show something of macarthur's gift for inspiring leadership, peck makes him a fine speaker, but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart. it is as if atticus finch from `to kill a mockingbird' had put on a general's uniform.whereas scott attempted a `warts and all' portrait of patton, the criticism has been made that `macarthur' attempts to gloss over some of its subject's less attractive qualities. i think that this criticism is a fair one, particularly as far as the korean war is concerned. the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering, militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp. many historians, of course, feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter's conduct was becoming a risk to world peace, and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated. even during the korean scenes, peck's macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real-life original probably was; we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters. (truman 's remark `he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday' was said about eisenhower, but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur's approach to international diplomacy). perhaps the film's attempt to paint out some of macarthur's warts reflects the period in which it was made. the late seventies, after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate, was a difficult time for america, and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation. another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools. if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur, something should have been shown of his early life, which is not covered at all. (the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines). one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur's father, himself a military hero. i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was, and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model. another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur's clash with truman, with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them. the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches.it would be wrong, however, to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether. although i may not have agreed with peck's interpretation of the main role, there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness. the film as a whole is a good example of a solid, workmanlike biopic, thoughtful and informative. it is a good film, but one that could have been a better one. 7/10.on a pedantic note, the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the dmz, the boundary between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war. (the pre-war boundary was the 38th parallel). also, i think that macarthur was referring to the `tocsin' of war. war may be toxic, but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin.

the film transported everyone back to october 20, 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great philippine 'i shall return' landing scene it was on that leyte shore where general macarthur reaped his fame above all, gregory peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general it is the stride, the set of the shoulders, the intensity it's what both men have had in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion with macarthur it was for the military with peck it was for the challenge of acting an academy award winner for "to kill a mockinbird", an oscar nominee for "keys to the kingdom", "the yearling", "gentleman's agreement", and "twelve o'clock high"he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist; from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney; from biblical david to captain horatio hornblower he has brought to them all his own unique insight, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and especially, his humor there is a scene where 'macarthur' stands on deck with the 'president of the philippines.' we can hear the dialogue: "general, i hope the water isn't too deep," says the 'president,' "because my people will find out i can't swim." then come peck's sonorous voice: "and my people are going to find that i can't walk on water!" as "macarthur," peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry through him we felt macarthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family

i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s. it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation. i'm not sure that squares with the facts.still the film is well done. the german high command reports wryly without emotion "the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse" as if all went according to plan.it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler. i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper.i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic. the american knock-off was a little flat.few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph. yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece.was gibs?

i remember this film from many years ago. certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact. it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier. but they were nonetheless very powerful.this subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years. and it was most effectively treated here, with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism.i wish it would be shown on tv at least once. or at least be available on tape or dvd. or is it? is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it??

made only ten years after the actual events, and set in the bunker under the reichstag, pabst's film is wholly gripping. it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war. haven't seen this in over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave. searing bit of dialog between two generals: "does god exist?" "if he did, we wouldn't." shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge, "im toten winkel" {aka "blind spot: hitler's secretary") and "downfall" with bruno ganz.

marvelous james stewart, vera miles vehicle. what makes this historical film dealing with the fbi so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by stewart in the film.the film shows a history of the great investigatory agency. it deals with airplane bomb plots, killing off of indians in oklahoma for real estate gain, fighting organized crime, nazis and communists in that order. the human element is never far behind as stewart weds vera miles. they raise 3 children as miles' heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment.look for a brief but memorable performance by murray hamilton. years later, he appeared as mr. robinson in 1967's "the graduate."the film has nothing but praise for j. edgar hoover. he certainly brought the fbi up to par.true, this could be viewed as right-wing propaganda, especially with stewart's real-life republican views, but it's well done, historically informative, and the view of the family so well depicted.

the history of the fbi, as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks, interwoven with his personal life story. stewart and miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as is hamilton as an earnest agent. the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. it's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who's who cast of gangsters. some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just look out of place (stewart's daughter's school sequence). overall, it goes on way too long. nevertheless, it's worth a look for its handsome production values.

i found the fbi story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my new years day holiday viewing. its drama and action-packed episodes were thrilling. the hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. overall the photography, script and direction was perfectly creditable. rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda, as some might, i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. again, the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his (arguably) important work, i did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one.

the film as entertainment is very good and jimmy stewart is excellent as chip hardesty, with well done co-starring turns by vera miles and murray hamilton. but the film, directed by legendary director mervyn leroy, was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film, down to clothing, was closely watched and controlled by j. edgar hoover. not that j. edgar hoover didn't have something to be proud of. his management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world. but by 1959 hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom. and he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau. the films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred, and the bureau's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950's. enjoy the story, but with tongue firmly in cheek.

james stewart plays an fbi agent who began working with the agency before it was called the fbi and the story involves dealing with the ku klux klan, the prohibition era gangsters, world war ii german and japanese spies, etc. a continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history; far superior to any films being made these days.of special interest to older viewers familiar with washington, dc. in a scene about 20 minutes into the movie --- where james stewart finds out from vera miles that she's expecting their first child --- the scene was filmed in herzog's seafood restaurant on the former washington waterfront, the only movie in which this historic location appears. shortly after taking office, president kennedy decided that southwest washington, a 99% black neighborhood, was an eyesore and ought to be torn down. by decree befitting his position of undisputed royalty, the entire area, including the popular waterfront restaurant district, but excluding 3 historic churches; was reduced to rubble. black residents evicted from their homes relocated as best they could, and without federal assistance; likewise businesses were simply put out of business, few re-locating. restaurant row was converted into a sidewalk, and washington had no waterfront (restaurants, seafood stands, boats, etc) for about 10 years. as a lifetime resident, the herzog restaurant scene was our #1 reason to see this fine movie again.

this isn't among jimmy stewart's best films--i'm quick to admit that. however, while some view his film as pure propaganda, i'm wondering what's so wrong with that? yes, sure, like the tv show the fbi, this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support. but, as entertainment goes, it does a good job. plus, surprisingly enough for the time it was made, the film focuses more on crime than espionage and "commies". instead, it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose. now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart, then it's pretty certain the acting and writing were good--as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who wasn't about to waste the star in a third-rate flick. so overall, it's worth seeing but not especially great.

i first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on dvd.james stewart brings great depth to the role of chip hardesty, a hardworking and dedicated fbi agent. his life in the bureau is intercut with his family life, which is not all rosy. his wife (an excellent portrayal by vera miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job, and they even separate for a time; chip's best friend and fellow agent sam crandall (murray hamilton) is killed in a gunfight; chip's son, mike, enlists in the marines during world war ii. through it all, the family carries on with bravery and dignity.the action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. and the music by max steiner says it all; fidelity, bravery and integrity.this country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the fbi and, yes, to j. edgar hoover as well. if mr. hoover's type of vigilance had been observed, we might have been spared 9/11, the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we've had to put up with since his passing.

has anyone noticed that james earl jones is the waiter who is serving when hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake. i watched this movie on a video that i had taped off of the television. when i watched this scene i thought i recognized the voice of jones when the "waiter" laughed at the end. i rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. listen closely as the waiter laughs when hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby, then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter, albeit, quickly.

this is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about j.edgar hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting klansmen,going after indian killers, hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930's, fighting nazi's in the us and south america during world war 2 and commies in new york during the early 1950's. of course in 1959 we did not know about mr. hoover's obsession for keeping secret files on honest americans, bugging people like the rev. martin luther king, jr, but worst of all,his secret love affair with his deputy director,clyde tolson( if you want to know more about that subject, i suggest seeing the film citizen cohn). hoover aside, this story of a life in the fbi as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent, but dated film. vera miles as his devoted wife is also good. but jimmy is the movie. as much as hoover controlled production and always made sure the fbi was seen without fault, jimmy stewart gave the film a human side,quite an achievement considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder. the background score is also pleasant. i have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film. jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. tcm was the last network to show it a long time ago and i hope they show it again.

have you ever felt like your being watched, like someone keeps tabs on every move you make? well, just remember before you decide to break the law, the fbi will always be there. at least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama, the fbi story. it traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents, chip hardesty (james stewart).chip was with the fbi from day one, and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world, even occasionally his family. the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent, and how being one affects his personal life. the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them. the audience gets to see chip stop ku klux klan riots, go undercover to solve an indian murder/estate scandal, bring fugitives into custody, rescue hostages, and helped fight in wwii. he even helped bring communist spies to justice.stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much. one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both chip's family life and his job. we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son. we also observe his wife having a miscarriage, and his marriage having rocky times. almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job. vera miles gives a spotty performance, but it's very convincing, none the less. she was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her. well maybe that's just me? sadly, none of the other performances are worth mentioning, but the attention-grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested.the cinematography of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the south american jungles. the colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film. perhaps the greatest part of this movie was mervyn leroy's fabulous direction. every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story. it's chock full of ingenious camera shots, some with a very hitchcockian feel.all in all, the fbi story is a spectacular, but overlooked film. clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated, but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one. i enjoyed jimmy stewart's spectacular performance, and the captivating story.

in the tradition of g-men, the house on 92nd street, the street with no name, now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light. while it's 48 year director j. edgar hoover was alive, it would be showed in no other kind of light.the book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out. it's important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j. edgar hoover headed it. some of that time is covered in the film as well.but warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john 'chip' hardesty was created. hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties.in real life the bureau was headed by william j. burns of the burns private detective agency. it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film. burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration. when hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in, he did just that. through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold. in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbi's story itself. stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple. we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with, arresting ku klux klan members, a plot to murder oil rich indians, bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties, their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold war.there is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own. that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight. nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today.of course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american. still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one.the fbi story is not one of jimmy stewart's best films, but it's the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me. if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts, i'd feel a lot better about it. there's also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelson.vera miles didn't just marry stewart, she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates. it's dated mostly, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.

this is an entertaining "history" of the fbi, but it should be viewed as fiction, because that's exactly what it is. what else could it be when j. edgar hoover personally approved and had a cameo role in the production. james stewart is excellent, as usual, and the supporting cast, except for the talentless vera miles, is good. murray hamilton is especially good in a supporting role as stewart's partner and best friend. the fbi accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true. what is significant is what it leaves out.one of the most shameful parts of the film is the depiction of the killing of john dillinger. it is portrayed pretty much as it happened, but no mention at all is made of melvin purvis, the chicago bureau chief who headed the operation. instead, the operation is depicted as if the fictional chip hardesty were running it. it has been said that hoover was jealous of the publicity that purvis received after dillinger was killed; purvis was subsequently transferred to a remote outpost, and shortly afterward left the fbi. this is no doubt why purvis was never mentioned in the film. but this viewer, at least, paused to think that if purvis was treated this way, what about all the agents who conducted all the other operations depicted in the film. were they also completely ignored and replaced by the fictional hardesty.the film is probably accurate in its portrayal of fbi activity up through the end of wwii. however, after that point, the film would have us believe that the only threat facing the us came from international communism, which is no doubt what hoover believed. never mind the mafia. never mind the lynchings that were still going on in the south. never mind that blacks were being intimidated to keep them from voting in much of the south. i don't know if the fbi had started wiretapping martin luther king by the time this film was made, but if not, it wasn't very long afterward that it started.as i said at the outset, this is pretty good entertainment, but it should be viewed as the sanitized fictionalization that it is.

rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot, an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution. one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. if you can put aside rohmer's unabashed defense of the monarchy (and that is not an easy thing to do, given that, for instance, the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts), this is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished movie. lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century france, rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards. it is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works. and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be.

i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l'anglaise, in this beautifully acted, intellectually and visually compelling film. thank you so much, monsieur le directeur rohmer.

rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution. what's more attractive about "la anglaise..." (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that rohmer has achieved. the images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures. in some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in louvre musseum. every shot is like a piece of art.*my rate: 7.5/10------------------------------ --------------------------------

erich rohmer's "l'anglaise et le duc" makes a perfect companion piece to peter watkins' "la commune (paris 1871)." both films -screened at this year's toronto international film festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale. ironic, given the tragic events that were taking place in the u.s. during the festival.set in paris during the french revolution, the movie, based on grace elliott's (lucy russell) "memoirs," is a first-hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days. she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans (played by jean-claude dreyfus), who, in contrast to herself, is a supporter of the revolution.true to form, you don't know whose side of history rohmer is going to come down on. one of the earliest of the french "new wave" filmmakers, rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative. after all, in the midst of the rebelling-youth-viet-nam days of the late 60s and 70s, he was filming romantic little confections like "claire's knee." but don't sell the old boy short, folks, he's always been a student of human nature, not an ideologue, and "l'anglaise et le duc" continues to bear this out.rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" nor the "good guys'; they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities -and limitations. that's why his movies are always provocative, and this film is no exception.now for the technological nuts and bolts.rohmer, though making his way into his 80s, is still on the cutting-edge of cinematic innovation. the look of "l'anglaise" is like something you've never seen before. you guessed it, the old guy -like several of the festival's directors this year- has gone digital.all of the movie's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s parisian settings. as a matter of fact, you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film's psychological -and yes, i'll say it- political insights.toronto features some of the world's edgiest young filmmakers this year, as well as some of the world's oldest. and the old masters are standing there on cinema's cutting-edges right alongside the young ones.long live youth. long live old age. and long live erich rohmer.

anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies. this film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment. why? because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis. i repeat--intelligent dialogue! that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer's films, and that is why a lot of people don't like them. they prefer action. fine, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this.rohmer has always been accused of being "talky." well, he is, but to me that's a compliment, not a criticism. shakespeare was talky, too. is there a talkier play than "hamlet?" whenever the subject, or theme, of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values, there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values, an that is largely what this film is all about. aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person possessing that life is not so nice, or even despicable. (anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky, or "crime and punishment?") these are what this film is all about.the two leads in this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. lucy russell, who is english and speaks french as her second language, is especially brilliant. do yourself a favor and see this riveting film. it may be the last film by this screen master.

eric rohmer's "the lady and the duke". could have used a better translation for the title. "the english woman and the duke", perhaps, would have been more accurate. while it's obvious this film is not for everyone, judging by the comments to this forum, it is worth watching because in spite of the intricate pattern of the story, mr. rohmer has created a movie that could be seen as an art exhibit in a museum. the mixed technology used in the movie, ultimately, works well.the strange story of grace elliott, a noble lady who had been the mistress of the king of england and of the french duc d'orleans, holds our attention. the setting is paris during the days that followed the french revolution. the country was in turmoil and the power was in the hands of the people, who couldn't care less for the aristocrats. the images show the agitators running around with heads of famous people right after their trip to the guillotine.grace relation with the duc had ended, but she remains a true friend to the great man that is in danger, himself, of losing his own head. grace moves through all the horrors around her without being able of an escape. she even has an enemy in her own house, in the form of the cook, pulcherie, who would not hesitate to denounce her at the least provocation.watching the movie, at times, gives the viewer the impression one is going on a trip through the louvre watching those huge canvases that depict this crucial era of the french history. rather than finding the digitalization process distracting, we found it to enhance the film in many ways.lucy russell, as grace elliott, does a fine job to portray this woman who saw a lot during her lifetime. her french seems to be excellent, as it appears she is fluent in it. as the duc d'orleans, jean claude dreyfus made a fantastic contribution making us believe he is the nobleman himself without any effort. the supporting cast also was great. as an ensemble piece mr. rohmer gets good performances all around.for lovers of history, "the lady and the duke" will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to the vision of eric rohmer.

this is quite an amazing film to watch. using digital technology, the director, rohmer, has literally encrusted his living actors into painted backdrops. most of the time this works brilliantly, especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life. it is less successful in a few scenes, where it limits camera angles (they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example) but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own misconceptions and limited views of history as history itself. it is narrated using the memoirs of the duc d'orleans' ex- mistress, grace elliott. so, an event usually claimed as one of their own by marxist historians, especially in france, is here told from the point of view of a female aristocratic foreigner. inevitably a different point of view emerges -there can be no objective representation. the use of the memoirs device does give the film a rather episodic quality. personally, i found the story line around the king's death the most interesting. a staunch royalist she is shocked when the duc votes for the king's death (a basic knowledge of the french revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between grace and the duc here. he was louis's cousin and had himself elected to the assembly, where he promptly changed his name to philip equality). the filming of louis's death is masterly. grace and her maidservant are in meudon, out of paris, watching from a hill with a telescope. we do not see the execution, we only hear the maid's commentary, like grace. the most dramatic event of the revolution happens off screen. grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed. her view is that of an aristocrat. any justification of louis's death is literally beyond her vision. this is powerful, keenly intelligent film making. the love story between the duc and grace is insinuated, never told, and is powerfully moving (tho the duc does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times; what does she see in him? no accounting for taste). the undercurrents of madness (simply existing being enough to be a suspect) that sweep individuals along in a time such as the revolution are illustrated as grace's life is turned upside down, her house is searched daily, yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself! if you have any interest at all in a subtle, well told film, making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale, or the representation of a pivotal moment in europe's history narrated by an aristocratic foreign woman, its ultimate outsider, then this is well worth your time. it is a little slow in places but your patience is amply rewarded.

sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment. most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip. the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives. this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured. later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne. the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish. jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.

cecil b. demille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy, engrossing, entertaining, spectacular; in no way outdated.as a real fan of tv's deadwood, i'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more on-target.we don't have any giants in hollywood anymore. plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade: released, re-issued, re-issued all over again. filmmakers like today's spielberg, jackson, bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox. none of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years.

the master of movie spectacle cecil b. de mille goes west. using three legends of the old west as its protagonists (they probably never met),gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickock,james ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane. the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on, like the big indian attack.scenes like that are extremely well done.if you don't mind the somewhat over-the-top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western.look out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big horn.this part got him at least noticed in hollywood.

the plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic, which is actual even today. gary cooper is wild bill hickok, ideal for the role, together with john wayne and james stewart, they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation. jean arthur is great as calamity jane, nobody that i know played it better than her. even if might not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place. sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here. the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill, the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war, custer and little big horn, the uneasy relationship between buffalo bill's wife, a religious woman, with hickok a man who had killed plenty, also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes 'the plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film. anthony quinn has a very short appearance, that already shows what a great actor he was going to become. a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time.

this movie has wild bill hickok, calamity jane, buffalo bill and general custer all together. gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him. this was the first time cecil b. demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. this movie starts out with lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an indian war. calamity jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. this movie also deals with custer's last stand and is far from accurate. gary cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like jean arthur but i liked her here.

this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level.however if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcock,cody and calamity jane then look elsewhere, as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend.the story moves with a cracking pace, and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie.the sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout, also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior, he actually married one of demilles daughters in real life.indeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back, the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american history.so please take time out to watch this classic western.

this cecil b. demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but devotedly doting calamity jane. she really pulled it off! gary cooper is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'the plains are big, but trails cross ... sometimes.' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches. all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james. even abraham lincoln opens the story in person (or at least, demille would have us believe so). there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety, this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses. a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'. it isn't just a story about gun-runners, but about arming anyone for money, and doing so from the heart of washington. but let's not get into politics, let's leave that to demille, who can be guaranteed to be superficial. the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'bad boy of music'. antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns, whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. that is why it does not sound at all unusual, because we have heard it a thousand times. but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore, and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then, corny as it may be, but doubtless appropriate. it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian. gabby hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. gary cooper overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small?

this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock. he, buffalo bill cody, and calamity jane, are the central characters.as the civil war closes, lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice, "go west, young man," which, mercifully, the film didn't erroneously attribute to horace greeley, as a number of others did. but then, he gets assassinated, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indians.in the meantime, we see wild bill hickock, who interacts with a small boy, while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi. wild bill uses a bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy, calling it an "arkansas toothpick," which in reality was a different type of knife, though both were used throughout the frontier.hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man. cody has just gotten married, and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle down.when they arrive at their destination, they run into calamity jane, who has a crush on hickock. she looks at cody's wife, and asks buffalo bill, "is this your mopsy?" the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem, since one definition of "mopsy" was prostitute. demille wanted the line in, and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potter's books about peter rabbit, three of the rabbits were flopsy, mopsy, and cottontail. he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of ill virtue." it worked; the line stayed in.the indians were getting restless, in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers. cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area, so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area. cody led the troops; hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some of the hostile indians.calamity jane gets captured, and hickock gets captured trying to save her. they are brought to the chief, and although neither would talk, torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane's willpower, and she tells the route cody is using.the two are released, and hickock joins up with cody and his forces, in part to alert them they're walking into a trap. with hickok's help, they hold off the indian attack.hickock decides to go after the gun runners, and finally takes them prisoner. as they're waiting for authorities, hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.there are numerous historic anomalies in the film, but it retains the flavor of legend. pretty good for the 1930s.

after the failure of "the crusades" at the box office, cecil b. demille stopped doing films about non-american history. his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean lafitte to world war ii (dr. wassell). the first in order of production was this film, starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok, with jean arthur as calamity jane. james ellison was buffalo bill, john miljan (not a villain as usual) was general george a. custer, and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn. the villains were led by charles bickford (selling arms to the indians) and porter hall as jack mccall (who killed wild bill hickok).basically the film takes up the history of the u.s. after the civil war. lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has surrendered. lincoln talks about the need to secure the west (more about this point later). then he announces he has to go to the theater. that april 14th must have been very busy for abe - in "virginia city" he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same date.actually, while lincoln was concerned about the west, his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and it's citizens into the union as soon as possible. it was reconstruction that occupied his attention, not the west (except for the problems of maximillian and his french controlled forces in mexico against juarez). but he had been involved in actual problems with the west. in 1862 he sent disgraced general john pope, the loser at second manassas, to minnesota to put down a serious indian war by the sioux (the subject of mckinley kantor's novel, "sprit lake". pope, incompetent against lee and jackson, turned out to be quite effective here, and the revolt was smashed.however, with all lincoln's actual attention to western problems, it is doubtful that he says (as cooper repeats at least once), "the frontier should be secure." there is nothing to say he could not have said it, but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman. like saying, teddy roosevelt said, "eat a good breakfast every morning for your health." it is not a profound statement of policy. it is, at best, a statement of recognizable fact. cooper turning it into a minor mantra, like lincoln's version of the monroe doctrine, is ridiculous...typical of the way demille's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them.however, this is not a ruinous mistake. "the plainsman" is an adventure film, and as such it has the full benefit of demille the film creator of spectacle. as such it is well worth watching. but not as a textbook on lincoln's political ideas or his quotable legacy.

"the plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of cecil b. demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok (gary cooper), buffalo bill cody (james ellison), calamity jane (jean arthur), george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact, even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. truly, this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.transfer: considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. all in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. the audio is mono but nicely balanced.extras: forget it. it's universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!

i had never heard of robert roy macgregor before "rob roy" came out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. playing the title character, liam neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to oskar schindler, and jessica lange also does a really good job as his wife mary. archibald cunningham (tim roth) is one person very likely to make your skin crawl.all in all, this comes out as good as "braveheart" (maybe even better). i laugh when i think of how hollywood released two movies almost back-to-back taking a swipe at england. very good. also starring john hurt, eric stoltz, brian cox and jason flemyng.

i first saw rob roy twelve years ago. with little money for entertainment, i rented it for my fiancé and i to watch on a bone chilling winter's night. the movie i had wanted was gone, so i rented this instead, not expecting much, and was very much surprised with how good it was. i just recently watched it again, and loved it every bit as much as the first time. for those unfamiliar with the story, it's about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor, a cattleman and folk hero. from the little i know about the man and his story, liberties have been taken with the facts, but it's a movie, not a textbook, and so the filmmakers can be excused. basically, the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from. but, his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest. our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis, and mary, his wife, suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of archibald cunningham, a smarmy englishman with no soul. atrocities ensue, until, in an immensely satisfying conclusion, rob carves archibald up like a christmas turkey. there are many great performances in this movie, but allow me to touch specifically on a few. liam neeson, as usual, is fantastic, a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of. honestly, this man is like ice cream: even when he's bad he's good. his rob roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him, in the best way he knows how. jessica lange, as mary, gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering, dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure. you just know she doesn't take any b.s from rob, or anyone else for that matter. tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald, yet somehow, it works. all the posturing and preening, combined with some wicked dialogue, result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory. combine all of this, and the stellar work by other supporting players, with the luscious scenery of scotland, and you have what amounts to one really, really cool movie. if you haven't seen this, i highly recommend that you do.

the year 1995, when so many people talked about the great premiere of braveheart by mel gibson, also saw another very fine, yet underrated movie on scottish history, rob roy. although it is a very different film, especially due to the historical period the story is set in, rob roy has much in common not only with marvelous braveheart but also with the very spirit of epic movies.it is a film that discusses similar themes, like fight for dignity, courage, honor, revenge, family being a key to happiness. it also leads us to the very bliss of scottish highlands where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all grandeur of nature. robert roy macgregor (liam neeson), the main character is a true hero (so universal in epics), sort of "scottish robin hood" who struggles to lead his people out of oppression imposed by cold hearted lords. although he worsens his situation through the acts, has to suffer a lot, two things stay in his mind undeniably: honor that he is given by himself and love to his woman, mary macgregor (jessica lange). that leads him to unexpected events...except for the interesting content and quite vivid action, the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals. this factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe. many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images. for me, the most splendid scene was in the highlands when rob roy tells his boys what honor really means. then, he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman. the scene he escapes marguis of montrose (john hurt) to the waterfall is also worth a look as a stunning visual. of course, there is some graphic violence, like in the duel for instance, but i don't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films. its justification is like any other epic's: bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it. the most disturbing scene, for me, was the rape done on rob roy's wife by the villain of the story: archibald cunningham (tim roth). it's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away. however, all the rest is o.k. yet, there is one aspect that made me really love this movie, the performances.all the cast do perfect jobs, from the leading lian neeson who fits very well to the role of tall, brave, strong scottish man to the supporting cast of brian cox who portrays wicked killearn, a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war. jessica lange is very fine as mary macgregor and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film. there is chemistry between ms lange and mr neeson in many of their scenes. john hurt, one of the best british actors, does a terrific job as marguis of montrose, a corrupted man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means. i like that calmness of his portrayal. but the real villain is played by tim roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character, archibald - a man who mocks love, who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter. but, like in any good epic, this exceptional evil must find its end...and one more aspect: the musical score: such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long. the final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because i deeply combined these blissful tunes with the grandeur of locations. scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect. it was, as if, my second journey to scotland.rob roy is a very nice movie, very well directed, photographed and acted. it perhaps does not equal braveheart with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes, but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have: stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education. i really enjoyed that film, do not hesitate to call it metaphorically "highlands of entertainment" and rate it 9/10

i haven't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty. i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart. it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters. ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like, messy hair and beard with simple clothing. also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him, he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy. it's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace. gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter. the story contains a little romance, conspiracy and an underdog story. sound anything like braveheart? but instead of a film that cries out "freedom", liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour, love and justice. this makes it a more interesting film. much like gladiator. the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour. the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity. the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic. this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do. overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch. go and see it!

this is a very exciting and romantic film. i have seen it several times and never get bored with it. everything is realistic and it is a good plot. the actors are excellent liam neeson, jessica lange, tim roth and brian cox.i actually prefer this film to braveheart as braveheart contain so many historical misstakes. there is many exciting scenes - watch out for the bridge scen and the last fencing scene. this is really good and surprising scenes.the music are lovely...it really suits to the movie. the setting is amazing.

i loved this movie. the scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. on two fronts, however, "rob roy" scored far above average. first, i have rarely seen a "popular" film in which the quality of dialogue was so high. there were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay. i could give numerous examples, but why should i? just watch the film. second, this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more. for a drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a really believable villain. if you don't have one, there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys. and "rob roy" has not one, but three--the earl of montrose, his henchman kilairn, and archie. not one-dimensional villains, either, but fully fleshed and very nasty. it takes a bit more patience than "braveheart"--there's more dialogue, and the accents are a bit tough, but it's a much more clever and subtle piece. (as i said, i loved this movie!)

a very engaging, intelligent, and well-made film. liam neeson and tim roth play their roles superbly. the cinematography is outstanding. the fight scenes are amazing. this is a film i will enjoy watching again and again. one of my favorites.

when braveheart first came out, i was enthralled, and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film. when rob roy came out, i was intrigued, and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film. however, as time has gone by, my appreciation for rob roy has grown, and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished. braveheart is great entertainment, to be sure, but there are flaws as well. the most significant, in my view, is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce, who was without a doubt scotland's greatest king. another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, that the beginnings of mel gibson's egomania can be seen clearly for the first time. in contrast, rob roy has grown on me over the years. partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart. but also because rob roy is like fine wine, growing more mature and complex with each viewing.

i question anyone saying they don't care for this movie. some reviewers have said it didn't have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. don't listen to them!!! if you like shawshank redemption and/or braveheart, you will definitely love this movie!the acting performances are superb! tim roth, john hurt and jessica lang are allsuperb and liam neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size. the cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. it is onw of the few movies i have seen in my life (along with shawshank) that was virtually flawless from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc.!!!i was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed. i felt so passionately about it that i just registered with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop. i have seen this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone has loved it! you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning. if you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site, than you will love this movie! come on...all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at #32?!?! that should show you the age range of most reviewers here!this is a top 50 movie!!!

to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart. though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well. roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. scottland is still run by english nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. rob roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that braveheart was. there are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. rob roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.liam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor. he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose (john hurt). things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. sounds fair enough, doesn't it? problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves. one of them, known as archibald cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. played wonderfully by tim roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother. this man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. he rapes macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. along with another crony of the marquis (brian cox) cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt. this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.spoilers ahead!!!!!luckily for the macgregor's, a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. and for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. just when it looks like rob roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. the first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as cunningham! rob roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. the score is quite memorable, too. the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor. the film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. the film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.the hound.

mel gibson's braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film, but it left a sour taste in the mouth. rob roy, by contrast, is slightly less polished, but a better film by far. this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values, whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale. what makes this film is the cast. liam neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically reprised (in a watered-down fashion) in the phantom menace. the character is heroic, but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover. admirable yet human, he commands the screen. against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including tim roth's cunningham, obnoxious but brilliant, and john hurt's morally bankrupt laird. also to praise is jessica lange, as rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is only as it should be. this is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of its own convictions, and the strong performances make you care.

liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century. he is a true actor. he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary. mary is such a beautiful woman. it's her love that makes rob roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. they need each other. tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find cunningham disgusting. the scotland scenery is beautiful. the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. if you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy rob roy. there is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. and you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a scottish accent. one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. it's their skill as actors that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. this is something special.

the early to mid 90s were a high point, in my opinion, for the historical drama. last of the mohicans, braveheart, rob roy - all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods.rob roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by film. it really has everything - interesting story, great acting, remarkable dialog, and breathtaking scenery. i was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog. i can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved.something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. i found it to be more repulsive and shocking, albeit often more subtle, than most found in films set in modern times. the movie had a very racy and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era.the pace was very tight, with hardly a dull moment. there was much intrigue and political subplots that complicated things a bit, but yet did not detract from the main storyline.the action was also very well done and gripping. something that i will forever find remarkable is that during the highlight action piece in the film, there is no soundtrack whatsoever. it makes for a very tense, exciting sequence, since we have no musical cue as to the direction and resolution of the scene.rob roy will always remain high on my list of favorite films. i would recommend it to all.

this is the moving tale of scotland's legendary hero, rob roy, and his battles with the feudal landowners. like braveheart to which it is frequently compared, it is not very historical. despite their primarily fictional nature, i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two. the 13 century william wallace is, as others have noted, a larger than life national figure, while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsman.the story revolves around a clan chieftain, robert roy mcgregor, who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons. as the movie begins, he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle. rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble, the marquis of montrose, in order to buy cattle to herd to market. he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend, alan mcdonald. when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing, rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protégé, archibald cunningham, and his sleazy factor, killearn. rob roy's honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival, the duke of argyle, whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobite.the charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy, an intelligent, virile, and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale. personally, i feel that this is neeson's best performance, his brogue (albeit irish) adding authenticity for the average viewer. rob roy is a stubborn, proud, courageous, and honest man whose word can be trusted. he is a loving husband & father, and also touchingly loyal to his friend, mcdonald, who is accused of robbing him. tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, archibald cunningham, an egotistical, ruthless strutting peacock. he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women, whether willing or otherwise. the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity, though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder, rape, and thievery. also, he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl, betty, after she becomes pregnant with his child, resulting in her suicide. john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose, who is eventually implied to be cunningham's father.the movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife, beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary. those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife! i think the phrase used by this pair, 'how fine you are to me...' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema. the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as rob's wife, mary mcgregor. lacking make up, she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother. the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham, while the disgusting killearn looks on. her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace. i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as mary's pain and humiliation, but nothing intended to sensationalize. their kinsman, alastair mcgregor, shows emotional anguish when he learns of mary's rape, and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham. of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands, also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring. there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart, but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham. this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale.

its not braveheart( thankfully),but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around. i enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last week,find it has held up well over time. not a classic film,but a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment.

this is a very good, under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie.the basic story concerns rob roy's borrowing of 1000 pounds, its theft, and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen.cunningham( tim roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil.rob roy (liam neeson) is excellent too, but i think the writers used the word "honour" 1 too many times.the rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic, but not too gory. the story is good and you really want rob to win.all in all just shy of a classic.

this sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story. it is often compared to "braveheart" because both movies take place in historical scotland. even though i love braveheart, i think this is the better of the two films. jessica lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an oscar). liam neeson is fantastic in the title role. tim roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history (he was nominated for an oscar). john hurt is excellent as lord montrose, another dislikeable character. i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play. this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan, and lord montrose. rob roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor. montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. and that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. this movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. it has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. one of my favorite films.

overshadowed by "braveheart" released the same year, the two costume dramas beg comparison. i admit my bias against mel gibson, yet i maintain a rational preference for "rob roy." both "braveheart" and "rob roy" compellingly depict scots history in bloody, romantic fashion. "braveheart" is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. it's also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. note its cornball usage of slow motion filming. its violence is both ugly and glorious. it is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset. while "braveheart" surpasses "rob roy" in sheer levels of carnage (not to mention its indulgent running time), the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. its action is more understated, yet more surprising and clever. its sex is less showy, yet more erotic. "rob roy" also has a better realized romantic interest. its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era. and tim roth is a superlative villain. also recommended: "the last of the mohicans" and "the patriot." you may find the latter more akin to "braveheart" with its emphasis on blood lust, with the former more similar to "rob roy" in tone. all the of the aforementioned movies merit their r ratings for violence.

**attention spoilers**first of all, let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90's. it was an amazing achievement for all those involved, especially the acting of liam neeson, jessica lange, john hurt, brian cox, and tim roth. michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. but alas...it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to "braveheart". these are two entirely different films, probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland. yet, this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that "braveheart" is a better film than "rob roy". i like "braveheart" a lot, but the idea of comparing it to "rob roy" is a little insulting to me. to put quite simply, i love "braveheart", but it is a pale shadow to how much i love "rob roy". here are my particular reasons...-"rob roy" is about real people.let's face it, the william wallace in "braveheart" is not a real person. he's a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. because of this depiction, he is also a perfect person, never doing wrong, and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land. when he finally does fail, it is not to his fault. like jesus, he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most. he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective. but it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me. i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection. that is why "the last temptation of christ" is a better film than "king of kings", and that is also one of the reasons why i think "rob roy" is better than "braveheart". rob roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. now sure, not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness. let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act. but rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask of him.rob's wife mary, is also a normal, ambigious person. let us start though, with how she looks in this film. sure, she's beautiful, but she doesn't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show. compare this with the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) of william wallace in "braveheart". now these two ladies are hot, but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time (especially the lay persons). maybe not a fair comparison, but just another example of how rob roy's attempts for accuracy are far more effective.throughout "rob roy", mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion, cunningham. she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle, but doesn't because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape. such revenge would surely mean the death of rob, and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.the villains in "rob roy" are equally as compelling. although the enemies in "braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. robert the bruce, a man both brave and cowardly, is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm. should he take his claim as the king of scotland, or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name? bruce is the most ambigious character in "braveheart", but from brutus in "julius ceasar" to fredo in "the godfather part ii", these types of characters are hardly original. longshanks, although a compelling villain in his own right, is very one dimensional. he is the epidemy of evil, and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace's heroism."rob roy" has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery. first of all, let's start with marquis of montrose. he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image, that he's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. "see to it that i am not mocked" are his favorite words to his "factor". he is a man obsessed with power, upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him. he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure. he is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique.cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in "rob roy", and are also roy's direct assailants. callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical. he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis, which includes backstabbing and trickery. cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis. he needs a father, little does he know that the marquis is his real father. therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn, he grabs it without even questioning it. he is very much like the evil of modern man, so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.many have criticized tim roth's performance in this film as overacting. hogwash i say. it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement, is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character? we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life. "rob roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed. it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion. rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world.another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll. he is a true nobleman, and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis. he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary, and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor. he gives the world hope for the people of power. hopefully, people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule.- the final duel in "rob roy" is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in "braveheart".one thing i get tired of is people telling me that "braveheart" is a better film because of the battle scenes. first of all, battle scenes are hardly original. from "spartacus" to "gladiator", hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes. "braveheart" has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film, but they suffer from one important problem. these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.now, don't get me wrong, duels are hardly original either. in fact, there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes. but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold. it is one of the greatest scenes in film history. let me explain why...first of all, the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. cunningham is effette and dangerous, rob roy is strong and courageous. cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword. cunningham fights with quick tricky movements, while roy's fighting style is more obvious.the whole film, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, is leading up to this moment. it is powerful stuff, and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. when rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively,) it is one of the greatest moments in film history. rob wins because he has more to live for, and his honor is more powerful than 10 cunningham's. the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell "freedom!". but hey, maybe that's just me.- "rob roy" is more realistic than "braveheart"i don't know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in "rob roy", but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. i feel that many people are bored by "rob roy" simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying. if this is the case, then read some shakesphere, or put on the close-captioning. "rob roy" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's. many of the dialogue in this film is clever, but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.by contrast, the dialogue in "braveheart" is hardly very interesting. of course, what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian? this is a legend, and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times. this film takes place several centuries before "rob roy", and yet they talk like the people today. thus the reason that many people like it better. audiences today have become increasingly lazy, and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. therefore, as with many epic films, they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language. sure, it is clear that the wallace is scotish, but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of "aye"s for acknowledgement, the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound.so, do these descriptions prove that "rob roy" is a better film than "braveheart"? hardly. but if it proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that "braveheart" is a better film than "rob roy". to put simply, "rob roy" is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today's world. "braveheart" is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. you can make a decision on what you think is better...grade - a score - 9

major spoilers!! this is for people who have seen the movie!!commenters have touched on the major theme of "honor" in the film, and too many comparisons to "braveheart." i'll point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch on:this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion. the first character to get pregnant is the villain's (roth) girlfriend, and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. the shame of her situation ("i'm to have a bastard's bastard.") leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. the second character to find herself pregnant is mary, rob's wife, after a rape by roth's character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, rob). late in the movie, as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth, mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a tone hinting of abortion. rob replies in a noble tone, "it's not the fault of the child," and then states what he thinks the name should be, girl or boy. i find this "pro-life" stance on the part of the hero to be very un-hollywood. rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment -- not coincidental symbolism.another related theme is roth's character is a bastard, someone who evidently does not know who his father was, and has few kind words for his mother, though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck. is it coincidence that roth (devoid of family stability) is the walking definition of psychopath, while rob is the strong husband/father figure, and of course the hero. in the final sword fight between rob and the villain (roth), the former slices the latter deeply across the chest -- the left side of the chest, over the heart. his employer and pseudo-father figure (john hurt character) holds the mother's picture in his hand and gazes at it, before snatching it from the neck of the dead roth.also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic but neither was it off-camera and implied. i found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction, with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal, and subsequent post traumatic stress (as we call it now). my point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied, which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to take.in the final fight scene, i have to correct an earlier commenter: the weapon roth chose was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon rob chose was a claymore. someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene. roth would have the upper hand in such a situation, but of course the claymore is a distinctly scottish weapon. what is even more striking to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject) is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made: the actors seem actually trying to kill each other -- not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights (including the movies opening fight). even more true to history, roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon, which is it's purpose by design! (rapiers were edged, but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust.) rob uses the claymore in broad slashes, as it's design intent. the fight goes down as i would expect it to -- roth effectively wins. though rob wins the day by grabbing roth's weapon (more symbolism) and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut.folks, it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight.i'll also note that for whatever reason, i remember 1995 (the year of release) distinctly as a time of distrust of the u.s. government. hollywood was obviously tuned into that, with the release of both "rob roy" and "braveheart," and i think the anti-government leanings are why both films get so much comparison. i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans, tired of the same old, not so hidden messages from hollywood.

what can one say about a film that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic, and occasionally most weirdly -i wont say 'sympathetic'..i will say 'charismatic' villains in the history of the cinema, and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbanks were in their heyday? this is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny. i loved it. john hurt and tim roth were great villains. jessica lange was very moving, tender, and sensual.

this is one powerful film. the first time i saw it, the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience. i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd, used the english subtitles when i needed them, and really got into this movie, discovering just how good it is. it is excellent.the widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart, an involving tale of good versus evil. here, it's liam neeson (good) vs. tim roth (evil). both do their jobs well.few actors come across as despicable as roth. man, you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant, irritating puss. (he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here). neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart. jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead. the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved, so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this.

this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective. while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward. in truth, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period.poor vs. rich, honorable vs. dishonorable, a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)

michael caton-jones's scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same name...the film opens in the scottish highlands, with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james graham's cattle... the scene then switches to a sword-fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs, adorned shirts, soft colored coats, paleface make-up and conventional gestures...macgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose... when he enters an ill-advised trade agreement with montrose, he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montrose's evil-doers... the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie, though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape... when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers, the action becomes well understood, ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade...liam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character... he is intelligent, fair and virile... he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community... he is a loving father, a passionate lover, and a noble husband, driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains... he'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust... oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife, a proud peasant woman, brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat... lange's lines are filled with dignity and integrity: 'i will think on you dead, until my husband makes you so. and then i will think on you no more.'john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis, ruthless with money and tempered by the english court's fashion for foppery... he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service... honor, in his view, seems a quaint notion... he has two objectives: ruin the reputation of his rival, the duke of argyle, and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor... he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders' homes, to kill their people and their livestock...tim roththe perfect antithesis to the hero, is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer... he is a penniless british aristocrat, a nasty 'hired sword' wonderfully evil, ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish mist... his name is archibald cunningham... he turns out to be a liar, a thief and a murderer... he dismisses himself as 'but a bastard abroad, seeking his fortune and the favors of great men," and therefore can't care about anyone else: "love is a dung hill and i am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow." he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl...cunningham seems pathetic... he smiles foolishly, and utters words with affected refinement, but not terribly harmful-until a muscular swordsman insults him, and we discover that he's a cool head and an expert with a sword... he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nomination...and while brian cox is suitably odious as killearn, andrew keir is montrose's rival, the powerful local aristocrat, the duke of argyll, one of the few trustworthy men mcgregor meets outside his own family... set in 18th-century scotland, and with an atmospheric musical score, 'rob roy' is really a love story between a man and his wife, a recognizably human story, unjustly dwarfed by mel gibson's 'braveheart,' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing english landlords...

from the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast, to the intelligently written (and very quotable) script, from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by carter burwell, rob roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences: one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any area.there have been several comparisons made with braveheart, which came out the same year. with all due credit to mel gibson, braveheart struck me as too much of a self-conscious and preachy epic to rival rob roy as the kind of movie i would care to see more than once. while braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, rob roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling. not a single scene is wasted.rob roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. the characters are well fleshed-out, perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting.further, they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film.for example, while we hope the heroic rob roy prevails, we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor. tim roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema, yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is. rob roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.rob roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation.

at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles. the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between 'demons', bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse.be prepared: following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement.

gojoe is part of a new wave of japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historic themes, what the japanese call "period pieces". gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography, and editing. brilliant, even. the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in kurosawa's samurai epics, or the zaitochi series. another fine example of this genre is onmyoji (2001). i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors. other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include yomada's twilight samurai (2002) and shintaro katsu's zatoichi: the blind swordsman (2003).

well, if you are one of those katana's film-nuts (just like me) you sure will appreciate this metaphysical katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick.starring tadanobu asano (vital, barren illusion) & ryu daisuke (kagemusha). this samurai war between heiki's clan versus genji's clan touch the zenith in the final showdown at gojo bridge. the body-count is countless.demons, magic swords, shinto priests versus buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro sogo ishii will do the rest.a good japanese flick for a rainy summer night.

gojoe takes a little getting used to at first, but the final result is very satisfying. the tale, about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate, but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. there is a lot at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. the movie may seem a bit similar to other anime-inspired samurai film at first, but it does eventually delve into more mature/adult territory soon after.not to be missed. gojoe is one of the better samurai movies to come around post-kurosawa.8 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)

as incredible as it may seem, gojoe is an anime- and hong kong-inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message. this ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a great acting job done by daisuke ryu), a killer-turned-to-boddhist-monk benkei. benkei has sworn never to kill again, but he still takes up the sword to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion...gojoe is a film difficult to rate. it's visual imagery is stunningly crafted and beautiful, but it uses too much trickery (circling camera and high speed drives, expressionistic shots, leeched colors, digital effects etc.), so the end result is somewhat tiring. that said, the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful. if only the director sogo ishii would have been wise enough not to overuse his bag of tricks.other problem with gojoe is the amount of violence. for a film with such an anti-violent message gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes. also, the way the violence is shown is always on the edge of being self-indulgent; in fact, a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the films signature images. luckily, ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence as well. still, it seems that ishii is not sure whether he's making a traditional action film or a deeply moral allegory. the audience can't be sure of this, either, until the very end of the film. the powerful (albeit cynical) ending is what saves gojoe; it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore-fest.

another attempt by modern japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. successful, and not, in varying degrees.buddhist monk has a vision that he is to slay a legendary (and very active) demon at the gojoe bridge in order to attain enlightenment. while not at the forefront, buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie, much like kurosawa's "ran". it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although it's nowheres near "ran's" league. stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length. the lead actors are uniformly excellent. the music is really good. the two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes. the movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing. and the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups. this works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat. another recent film like this is tsui hark's "seven swords", great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing. asano really doesn't move like a sword wielding demon, his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scene.good movie, you'll probably find it interesting just don't expect traditional sword fights.

i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the director's other films in the past. i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge. it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled.i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes. they were hard to follow at times.ultimately, a moral tale. it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film. it is a film i would like to see again.some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a "psychic" level were well done.i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here. intense.

sogo ishii has taken the old myth of musashibo benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark, gory, spellbinding and terrific-looking movie. those unfamiliar with the legend won't need to be; the story explains itself nicely as it goes along. well worth seeking out even though there are no english-language home video versions.

i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i loved how this move was unlike crouching tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close.i think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of mahayana buddhist text (mahayana buddhism can be found in china, korea and japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... gojoe has the action, story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. i strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the u.s. my one complaint is in the last fight scene (i can't give anything away--sorry).

i personally thought the movie was pretty good, very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame. i really can't say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me a little too much, and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy. other than that however, the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot, great effects, and a lot of sword play. another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion. well i really can't say anymore about the movie, but if you're only outlook on asian cinema is crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers, i would suggest you trying to rent it, but if you're a die-hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film.

one of the less widely lauded of recent asian period action affairs gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering, exciting, layered and beautiful. i'm sad to say i know virtually nothing of the buddhist philosophy or japanese history and legend that surrounds this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me, but even without contextual knowledge this is still rich fare, taking a traditional fantasy structure into a, impactful higher plane. the story is of benkei, a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of gojoe bridge: prince shanao, himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons. thus the film becomes a matter of illusions and in benkei's case, indecision, a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge, for benkei to come to terms with his true nature and for prince shanao to come face to face with the nature of what he seeks to become. benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world, even when not in open conflict he is never at ease. director sogo ishii handles this one as an epic, with measured pace, camera work always stylish and often frenzied, without neglecting the need for more sedate moments to let the location sink in, there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere, there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy. the cinematography of makoto watanbe is important here, vivid and detailed, a richly evocative affair. actingwise daisuke ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as benkei, while tadanobu asano has a driven, cold arrogance as prince shanao. of the leads masatoshi nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man, smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are. the film all fits together well, it is however a touch flabby at times, it begins slowly, some shots are a little drawn out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary. as for the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves, it has artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans, often obscured by objects, flashing blades and fast moving individuals, whirling with deadly force through their adversaries are the order of the day, it is invigorating to watch but in the end i could have done with a little more traditionalism. there is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well, it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting. overall though i found this to be a pretty great film, its not one for regular action fans or swordplay enthusiasts seeking another azumi, rather a deeper and more mystical beast, its ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of such fare. but as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more adventurously inclined it might do so too. well recommended at any rate.

this movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies. many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won't understand why i find it so enthralling so i will try to explain...the movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights, and while it has a few minor anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. the story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk benkei and the young prince yoshitsune on gojo bridge. during the fight according to legend yoshitsune bests benkei and the monk becomes the prince's loyal retainer. this movie is a revision of that story however and involves war, dark prophecy, and political maneuvering.one of the main themes in the movie is "mappo", which is the prophecy by the buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. it was believed in heian japan, after the eruption of mt fuji and the civil war between the taira (heike) and the minamoto (genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. it is a time of demons.next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of yoshitsune's sword training by the tenku (raven goblins) of karuma. defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off. this is said to be where ninja clans began historically. yoshitsune's depiction in gojo nicely accommodates all of this.then there is benkei, and the various strains of buddhism depicted, including a lot of esoteric buddhism of the shingon sect. these are all depicted quite accurately, and just to add a little extra, the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story, i.e. it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing.all-in-all it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly true-to-life for the period. the scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic. the soundtrack is great, very brooding and ominous. i also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good. benkei is a great brooding anti-hero, shanao (yoshitsune)is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power, and tetsukichi the scavenging sword-smith makes for and interesting depiction of the "common man" and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters.as to the plot, to see why it is so good, i really suggest you dig up an old book on japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted robin hood vs little john story into a gory tale of intrigue, violence and infernal karma.

i happily admit that i'm a sucker for a beautiful film, and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film. not one the length of gojoe though, even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography i've seen since the korean period piece musa. however, gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images (as does musa... don't which to imply a contrast) - it's second greatest strength is superb acting, and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy. i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end, but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way. vague ones, but definitely thoughts :pone department in which the film could have been better is the action. there's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups, and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground. it does create some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves, something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone.still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films i've seen for quite some time. recommended!

it's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that's based on the life of any number of british monarchs. just take a well respected british or australian actor, make things look pretty, and you're guaranteed a formula for oscar success.the young victoria is no exception, getting just about everything right, the cinematography striking and beautiful, with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. starring emily blunt in a role she can finally soar in, the film begins with victoria's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to prince albert (rupert friend). as the young victoria herself laments, she's moved like a chess pawn by a variety of parties as she finds her footing and her voice as one of britain's most influential rulers.while this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory, it is the development of victoria's relationship with albert that makes the film slightly more interesting. i confess: i have a degree in history with a specialization in the victorian era, so i'm a bit attached to these figures. despite their many flaws as rulers, victoria and albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people. they left their legacy in the arts, in public health and education, and in victoria's conservative views and mourning culture after albert's death. but these things are only briefly hinted at during the film.it is fairly well established that victoria and albert were not only madly in love, but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages. even if it did occur behind the scenes, their's was certainly one of the best known. blunt and and friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice, the proper mix of restraint and desperation. it's a different love, not usually shown on screen, especially in this sort of film. it's encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field.but we don't get to see that love enough. while the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political trappings, it doesn't quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high. also, without delving into the more advanced important public work of the pair, things feel a bit in limbo, superficial instead of intimate, and sometimes confusing. it's not as big an issue during the film, but afterward, the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched, despite the perfect performances by the leads, most noticeably blunt who even captures the famous monarch's expressions.for as much as it tries, victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain sparkle that would take it from solid to classic.

i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times now,the first time, i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour. an engrossing entertaining film, thank god no kiera knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. nothing bad about the movie at all, no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing. might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as conroy and lord melbourne

when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie. almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.the only thing that really let me down are the performances. emily blunt(the devil wears prada) is the star of the film, bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance. rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt. paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him. jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.to me the film feels like unfinished. maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie.but overall it's a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt.

a new side to the story of victoria and albert is brought to life by director jean-marc valle. most people's cursory thoughts of queen victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning. emily blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective. she portrays victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne, and early years. blunt's victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film. her strongest scenes are with albert (rupert friend) and lord melbourne (paul bettany). all the actors acquit themselves well including miranda richardson in what could of been a throw-away role.though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic "acting" moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing. there are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing, the film tries to stay true to the relationship between victoria and albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period. the set design and costumes are outstanding.this film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history, period dramas, and of blunt and the other actors. heartily recommend.grade: a

i really thought that this movie was superb. not only is the history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. i was a fan of emily blunt's portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth. blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert.the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well. i appreciated the beautiful score, which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story. i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding, some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict.there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009's best!

the young victoria is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by jean-marc vallée of stalwart julian fellowes' version of the youthful lass who was to become england's longest reigning monarch - victoria. much of the early portion of the film, that part when victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (miranda richardson) and sir john conroy (mark strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations. but once victoria (emily blunt) comes of age and is courted by prince albert (rupert friend) the film blooms. blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' - including her secretary lord melbourne (paul bettany). but as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing german prince albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of albert. the film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of queen victoria and prince albert's effect on the various royalties throughout europe! it makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in emily blunt and rupert friend. a solid if not transporting epic. grady harp

with all of the films of recent,dealing with the british monarchy,is it really time for another? answer:you bet! the young victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from britain dealing with the royal family. in this case,it deals with the early life of princess victoria,and events leading up to the coronation of her becoming queen of all england,as well as her romance & eventual wedding to prince albert. the film also deals with the tempestuous lives & careers of both england's queen & prince,as well as several other events that transpire (political turmoil,etc.). emily blunt plays a radiant victoria in her youth,while rupert friend is her beloved & best friend,prince albert. the rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of miranda richardson,as the dutchess of kent,and the always welcome on screen,jim broadbent as king william,as well as a cast of others that shine on screen. jean marc vallee (c.r.a.z.y.,loser love),directs from a winning screenplay by jullian fellowes (vanity fair,gosford park,separate lies). i absolutely went out of my head over the film's visual look (by cinematographer hagen bogdansker),who gave each frame of film a painterly look (with the help of production designer,patrice vermette),as well as some tight editing (by jill bilcock & matt garner). what i also appreciated in fellowes' script is the use of a game of chess,as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation (the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a chess board). this is smart,well written,directed,filmed,edited & acted entertainment (and enlightenment)that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema. rated pg by the mpaa for a few scenes of sensuality,some brief violence ( a little bloody,although nothing too gory),a rude outburst of language,and some on screen smoking

just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn't go anywhere, we are given a treat, a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by emily blunt, a marvel in the leading role, paul bettany, rupert friend, miranda richardson, and mark strong, as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of england's most powerful monarchs. "the young victoria" dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power.emily plays the queen, with a good combination of raw strength and innocence, someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand, but who possesses enough confidence to move forward. she is able to portray victoria, as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand.victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown, and even when she takes command of her new position, she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course, the right support. luckily for victoria, there is albert, a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. there is amazing chemistry between the two performers, and there's little doubt what the outcome will be, but there is the figure of bettany's prime minister, a man who provides victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her.miranda richardson and mark strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl. every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development, but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by blunt, an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances. in here, she is given the breakout role of her career, a real life historical figure, who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. she shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. she also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes."the young victoria" is not a royal epic portrayal of england's ruling class. it is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them. in the end, the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction. in here, there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far, and there is of course, a good old fashioned love story.

who knew? dowdy queen victoria, the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband, prince albert, actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days. 'the young victoria' not only chronicles the young queen's romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.the act i 'set-up' draws you in right away. following the death of victoria's father, the duke of kent in 1820, less than a year after victoria's birth, the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy, who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen-to-be. conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious 'kensington system', rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up. what's more, victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became queen.the film explains that in 1830 parliament passed the regency act, which established that victoria's mother would become regent (and hence guardian) in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor. during this time, the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer. strong-willed victoria would have none of it, and refused to go along with conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans. the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy; the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife. as a result, the duchess attempted to limit victoria's contact with the king. in an over-the-top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history, the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet, stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent.king william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne. victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy, whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable. they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her mother.'the young victoria' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victoria's coronation as queen. a good part of the film deals with victoria's relationship with lord melbourne, the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was. in the beginning melbourne gains the young queen's trust and they become good friends. in the early years of her reign, she sees melbourne as a progressive, but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician, hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing. in reality, melbourne was more a father figure to victoria, but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert, as though they were romantic rivals.the plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel, of the more conservative tory party, as the new prime minister. the film chronicles the events of 'the bedchamber crisis' in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians. the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings, one of the duchess's ladies-in-waiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him. because of her hatred for conroy, victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings' alleged pregnancy. as it turned out, hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor. victoria's inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affair.the rest of the 'the young victoria' deals with -- of course -- the romance between the queen and prince albert. victoria kept albert waiting, as the film makes clear, since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign. they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisis.i find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip, the current queen's husband. while philip is mainly danish, he went to school in germany and had in-laws who were of german background. both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court (there's a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years!). albert's struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs, they had to find something to do. both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didn't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever-popular wives.fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his 'interference' in her affairs. albert doesn't want a second 'bedchamber crisis' so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a compromise involving victoria's bedchamber ladies. victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassin's bullets almost cuts them both down (in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happened!).the performances in the film are uniformly excellent, especially the principals, emily blunt and rupert friend. the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography (no mention of victoria's depression after albert's death). but 'victoria' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson.

i was initially forced to attend by my wife as she is fascinated by the royal families of britain and their history, and she won't go to the cinema without me. although viewers shouldn't expect to be electrified, this film is very well made and the visual aspect is second to none. in many ways it helps dispel the myth that victoria was the miserable unsmiling dumpy woman usually seen in photographs. she was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years, a fun loving happy young woman. her love of albert was the essence of true love, and even if you only count the number of children she bore (9), they must have had a passionate relationship. all of this is well borne out in the film. to this end, the cast has been well selected with both emily blunt and rupert friend giving sound performances as victoria and albert.(spoiler alert) the historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did prince albert get shot while defending victoria. there was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together, but nobody was struck by the shot/s. i also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between victoria's mother and sir john conroy. it is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for victoria's distaste for both her mother and conroy. i also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between victoria and lord melbourne as erring on the romantic, or at least having the potential to become romantic. he was already in his late 50's when victoria came to the throne, and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era, the movie portrays melbourne as being a dashing 30 something and rival to prince albert. there were apparently rivals to albert, but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life, and albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case.all in all i have spent worse times at the cinema, and brownie points with my wife can't be a bad thing either.

it is queen victoria's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men.shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her prime minister lord melbourne to the extent that she became known as "mrs melbourne".after the death of her beloved husband,albert,she was referred to as "the widow at windsor",and years later,a long friendship with her scottish ghillie john brown earned her the nickname "mrs brown".such is the price women paid in a patriarchal society. the reality is somewhat different and "young victoria" goes some way towards putting the record straight,depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the inequities in her society and at her court. courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy,plotting and counter-plotting,naked ambition and sometimes,outright murder. as an 18 year old innocent,victoria ascended to her uncle's throne,thus initiating a positive orgy of intrigue and a power-struggle between prime minister lord melbourne and his rival sir robert peel. lord melbourne cuts a dash in the old public school man kind of way with his finely-honed cynicism and his well-polished gems of advice. hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him,and even perhaps a little in love,an awe that he ruthlessly exploits,drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted sedition as he forces his policies through against victoria's better judgement. into the arena rides prince albert,on a mission from king leopold of belgium,keen on political rapprochement between great britain and the rest of europe. at first a reluctant suitor,he soon falls in love with the english queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers. "the young victoria" is a beautifully photographed,brilliantly-scored and very sumptuous movie.i note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century english royalty should somehow have shown the empress of india and her family living in rags in a filthy workhouse........i don't think so. i must single out the remarkable miss emily blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young princess margaret's.hers is obviously the pivotal role, and she has absolutely no trouble in dominating the film despite strong performances from mr jim broadbent,miss miranda richardson and miss harriet walter,all immeasurably more experienced. the music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way obtrusive. the fact that britan flourished more under its two great queens,elizabeth the first and victoria,than at any other time is a matter feminists might like to make more of,but,i suspect,like prime minister margaret thatcher really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable.if you can work out why there might be a ph.d . in it.

i saw this on the big screen and was encapsulated with it. the period of queen victoria's younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest roles in the world.the script is perfect, the acting is amazing, the history and attention to detail is out of this world. emily blunt is perfect as victoria. funny how her mother is played by elizabeth the 1st and william iv is played by prince albert! (think blackadder).this portrayal of victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once - i'm sure she would have been on jeremey kyle show if it had been around then: "my mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life".a perfect piece of a major part of british and commonwealth history.

this is on my top list of all-time favourite films! it is a fantastic and insightful film. it was historically interesting and great to watch! i thought the acting from emily blunt was fantastic and rupert friend was a fantastic albert, the best actor was chosen for albert. the costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house, were amazing and detailed. i just loved it, all of it! i loved the childhood scenes were she's getting 'bullied' by john conroy. and where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult. one again the writers have done it! they produced this fantastic script! it thoroughly deserves the awards they got. (oscar and bafta wining sandy powell, for costume design. a bafta for best make-up and hair, an oscar in best achievement in art direction, best achievement in costume design, best achievement in makeup. broadcast film critics association awards for best costume design, also nominated for best actress emily blunt. cdg for excellence in costume design for film - period. hampton's international film awards for an audience award for best narrative film. pfcs for best costume design.sudbury cinefest, doesn't say what for. vfcc for best actress, emily blunt.) overall 10 wins and 11 nominations! that pretty good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards have a look yourself, its really interesting! personally rupert friend should have got an award.

enjoyed the movie very much. certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more, and there is truly a lot more historically to find out!did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization, particularly of the shooting event? there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at? prince albert's contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on it's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here.the costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production (which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one) wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york? i.e. did princess victoria really stuff an entire truffle/rissole(?) into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full? 'could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie, or indeed in her shoes at all. yet loved the casting of the principals, whose acting was convincing, so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well? i always felt like a totally detached, uninformed outside observer, much more so than with "mrs. brown" or even "the queen". yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time.

the young victoria is a beautiful film and has presented queen victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her. the films wipes away the "i am not amused" impression of queen victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman.as i love history, particularly victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised, i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas. i was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate, but it was and i loved it. i found out new facts about queen victoria that didn't know before and it interested me greatly.queen victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest monarchs, and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like. she was treated so badly by her mothers adviser sir john conroy, because he wanted britain to have a regency. this was what inspired victoria to be a fantastic queen, which she was! the romance between her and albert was so deep and this was very well done by emily blunt and rupert friend, who were both brilliant! the young victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british history...i love it!!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!

i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays (such as the ones of, for example, vanity fair or the other boleyn girl), but with a magnificent production design, european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have.fortunately, the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation, and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story, the excellent performances from emily blunt, paul bettany and jim broadbent, and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view.and i say "unexpectedly" because i usually do not pay too much attention to those details."victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in contemporary civilization, and not only on the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural ones.but i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much, and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much.i also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed, which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions.i also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes.the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story, something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay.i liked the young victoria very much, and i really took a very nice surprise with it.i hope more period films follow the example of this movie: the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story, and not as the replacement of it.

overall, i thought it a very nice movie - i hate to use the word 'nice' as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by rupert friend and emily blunt were very strong. what i liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good, strong writing (thank you julian fellowes :d); nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp, i.e not sensationalised greatly (when victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now queen, well you couldn't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown). it was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth.undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between victoria and albert, though somewhat fairytale-ish on the face it, was in fact a slow burning candle and friend and blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged (my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind; so much said without any words, that's what film is all about). blunt held her own beautifully as well, she has a face that demands your attention and i can't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous. if i was blunt i would have trouble parting with any of them! the rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well, harriet walter as queen adelaide being a highlight.the only qualm i have, is that it lacked a sense of urgency, or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting? (it was rather tame) i don't know, i wanted 'something' to happen that would have victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more. when she and albert argued, i loved it, i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may be just me.lastly, at the risk of sounding all patriotic, it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially in one so young. this may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of victoria's young life is immediately apt to what i have been writing for one character of mine in 'the sword & the scion' but nevertheless, it did flag up those feelings (for those following my book, can you guess what character victoria so aptly reflects?) it might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn't seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation, which only in turns renews appreciation that queen victoria and prince albert were so active in this domestic domain. it made the government appear rather useless - nothing much has changed then i suppose.blog on films and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com

what more can be said? i have not been this fascinated with a young actress since cate blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago. and although both blanchett and blunt have played queens now( seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses), the roles are complete polar opposites.simply put if you are looking for high passion, compelling drama, and machiavellian intrigue, this is not the movie for you. this isn't to say that the script or direction was bad, its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like elizabeth i, anne boylen, henry viii, henry v, henry ii and elainor of acquitane. these are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of british ,and in most cases, world history. victoria, in contrast, ascended the throne without incident, she quasi-governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the navy, her state had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians, and she married young had a harmonious family life. the facts of her life are not the sturm und drag such as powerful dramas are made of.the heart of the film, aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne, is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign- a love story. marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion, yet victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a patron saint marital fidelity, happiness and ideal family life. thus, central to the film is the budding love of victoria and her prince albert. i was very taken with rupert friend's characterization of albert whom he portrayed as a kind, patient, somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man, looking to" do good in the world and help". in short, he is a good man with a good heart, not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around, but as that is not the point of the story, that does not matter. the heart of the character shines through thanks to friend's understated yet earnest performance. as for the queen, well..emily blunt is sublime. her beauty cannot be denied, but she is more than something pretty to look at; her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness. the slightest arch of the eyebrow, glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much. again, this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas, its not that kind of movie. but what ms. blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety. for example, we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by victoria's mother ( miranda richardson) and her scheming adviser/lover conroy expressed in the simple things like victoria trying to sketch her dog. we see her delight and fascination upon first meeting albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him. we see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing parliament upon her ascension. and my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous, happy, and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life- ask the man she loves to marry her, a proposition so ridiculous for those times( and some would say now) that victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say "marry me". again, this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions, but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much.so, overall, i judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such i give it a 7. i felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development, namely miranda richardson as the duchess of kent, and the characters of conroy and lord peal. again, the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters, but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment. also i would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between victoria and albert, but that may be just my greed for more scenes between friend and blunt. in summary, don't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is, a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures. i give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances, brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent victoria of emily blunt. and anyone who has any shred of romance left in them, you will be touched by the end of this movie. god save the queen.

one of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in, it ends much to soon! than were left looking at the screen like, "no they didn't!", lol. good performances all around! the acting is marvelous with emily blunt simply outstanding! i knew she would give a solid, convincing performance catching young victoria's regality, temper, and vulnerability through out the entire movie. also, the production is outstanding in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. a remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as queen, later marrying prince albert, than ending with the birth of their first of nine children. it had a well written screenplay and flawless editing. rupert friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young prince albert vying to win the young queen's attention, than securing her love, before lord melbourne(paul bettany), was engrossing to watch. just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage victoria and her mother, which was fury at times, as with her mother and king william (whom also disliked her mother). the acting and scenes were captivating, highly emotional. i would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era, and indeed, anyone who loves a compelling true romance story

having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up or down stairs? having others taste your food before you eat it? facing an over-bearing mother? these are only a few of the obstacles which the young victoria has to deal with in this film (there's also the various power struggles going on, as well as attempts on her life). needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing.i had only previously seen emily blunt in the devil wears prada (and little else). as she was in that film, she is once again the standout here. i was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young victoria, and thought she handled the role very well. she makes the transition from the young victoria we meet at the start of the film to the queen victoria she becomes later entirely believable. blunt is perfectly cast in the role, showing all the different sides (from the vulnerable, to the strong, from the young victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control). not enough can be said about emily blunt in this role. she's - quite simply - exquisite, commanding your attention every second she's on screen. she keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film.rupert friend proves to also be well-cast as victoria's love interest (and eventual husband), prince albert. the actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship. they have their disagreements, but you can tell that they are in love. blunt and friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between victoria and albert. the other actors in the film are also very good. paul bettany as lord melbourne, miranda richardson as the duchess of kent, mark strong as sir john conroy and jim broadbent as king william. there is not a single bad performance in this film. the less-focused-upon people are well-portrayed also, given what little screen time they have. even victoria's dog (a cavalier king charles spaniel named dash) is memorable and makes an impact in the film.although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of victoria's life - especially at the end - and instead *tells* us what happened (with her and albert) on screen, what matters the most is what we actually *see*. this is, after all, a film about 'the young victoria' (not 'the middle-aged victoria', nor 'the old victoria'). while there are some embellishments made on history with this film, it remains focused on what it sets out to do - which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power.the movie looks amazing, the costumes emily blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film, never detracts from it. it's exceptionally shot and, unlike a lot of films these days, this movie is actually a good length, as it doesn't run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it's needlessly being drawn out.it goes without saying that what makes this film so great is emily blunt. she's in fine form here, turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been, had another actress been cast in this rather important/historic role. this is one finely-crafted film, with excellent performances that should definitely be seen. if you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history, this is a must-see.

it is a tricky thing to play a queen. on the one hand, the actress has to be majestic and imperious, and on the other, she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds, since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line. emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria, but it's not as full a performance as i'd like, no blame to her. i can't help but feel like this is a mills & boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, elizabeth. hence blunt doesn't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions, at least not to the full extent, since she's, y'know, the young victoria. to see the old victoria, check out mrs brown.jean-marc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie. he last did c.r.a.z.y., which was excellent and propelled him to fame. it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies. but while vallee wrote c.r.a.z.y., this one was by julian fellowes, and though i really enjoyed his gosford park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. i soon got lost with all the governmental politics. maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy. i'm just saying.

the cinematic interests in the british monarchy continues with the young victoria (1837 to 1901), after having seen in recent years, the efforts with keira knightley's the duchess, cate blanchett's elizabeth films, and scarlett johansson and natalie portman's take on the boleyn sisters with the other boleyn girl. more contemporary stories would include helen mirren's award winning portrayal of the queen on the current reign of queen elizabeth ii at the turn of princess diana's death.each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas (ok, so some may dispute johansson) or were the flavour of their moment, and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured, and in fact elizabeth had enough to span two films. however, the young victoria, as the title already suggests, is a lite-version of the young queen's life, and if you're looking for that definitive event, or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady, self-serving politicians, unfortunately there's nothing of depth here.that's not to say the young victoria is without. directed by canadian jean-marc vallee (best known for crazy) and written by julian fellowes, this film chronicles in very plain terms, ,the life and times of victoria (emily blunt, soon becoming the new it girl) when she was a child, the troubles she faced before coronation such as the eagerness of her mom the duchess of kent (miranda richardson) and her adviser sir john conroy (mark strong) to appoint themselves as joint-regent to her throne, as already planned for by reigning king william (jim broadbent). as if that wasn't enough, the political power play enters the picture with lord melbourne (paul bettany) being a prime minister-in-waiting trying to gain the trust of the new queen, and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace. on one hand you'd understand the need for a young, and new queen to have trusted people in key positions, but on the other, are they really acting in her interests, or in the interests of others?even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with prince albert (rupert friend), where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film, and pretty much everything already included in the trailers. for both, they've been brought up under the influence of others, and told each step of the way exactly what to do. even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance, if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding, and to do so with the help of each other. instead of being pawns, there's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling, and at times absurd, rules and regulations. trust also becomes a much valued commodity, and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean.however, all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative, from childhood to romance, marriage and children. in fact, there's so much fast-forwarding here, especially the last few minutes filled with inter-titles, that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more, and room of course for another movie, which i suspect would probably not see the light of day, but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response, and come out with a mini-series or such. it's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes, sets and art direction would be confined to a film that's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues, that they don't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character-defining adversary.with its star-studded cast, one would expect more, but one would be left wanting more instead. recommended for those who are ever curious about kings and queens in the british monarchy, only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned.

princess victoria (emily blunt) is in line for the throne of england. the present king william (jim broadbent) is not well and may not live long. however, vicky's scheming mother, the duchess of kent (miranda richandson) and her aide, john (mark strong) want to force victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the "regents" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age. the young lady refuses, despite john slapping her around. it is another sign that victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. yet, when william does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. first, she must surround herself with the "right" advisers to govern wisely. she chooses handsome lord melbourne (paul bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for vicky. which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. sooner than not, the young queen should select her future mate, as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom, for an heir must appear in the coming years. meanwhile, in germany, some distant relatives of the british royal family are hatching some plans as well. handsome prince albert (rupert friend), of the saxon-coburg dynasty, is prodded by his father to court the young english royal. once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. but, since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making, can he succeed in winning her heart? this is a lovely film, made even better by a completely winning performance by emily blunt as victoria. yes, she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including broadbent, richardson, bettany, strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest. also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way. if anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit. however, this is only a minor, minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. in short, young and old, should make time for young victoria. it is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings.

this film is about the life of queen victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of great britain."the young victoria" has amazing production. every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail. the extravagant costumes, lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make "the young victoria" very impressive. i was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. how every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. the scene that strikes me the most was when victoria talks to melbourne. melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from victoria's angle, while from melbourne's angle victoria was situated between the space where melbourne held his arm on his hips.story wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of queen victoria. many events are rushed through or not even explained. i expected a grand scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.overall, "the young victoria" is a good film, and it would have been even better if it was longer, so that events could be properly explained without rush.

and that's why historic/biographic movies are so important to all of us, moreover when they are so well done, like this one!before i saw "the young victoria", i knew a few things about queen victoria, but in the end i got much more knowledge about it. emily blunt is simply great as victoria (who would guess that!) and she probably will get a nomination at this years oscar's. personally, i'm cheering for her...for technical issues, i am pleased to say that is a very successful production, with wonderful art direction/set decoration and, of course, like it was expected to be, a terrific periodic costume design! the one drawback is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but foremost, incredible woman and mother! bravo: 9 out of 10!

rupert friend gives a performance, as prince albert, that lifts "the young victoria" to unexpected levels. he is superb. as we know, queen victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after prince albert's death and looking into ruper friend's eyes i understood. the film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life. an act of love. i believed it, or i should say, him. i believed what he felt was real. nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of friend's characterization. emily blunt is good but i didn't believe for a minute she was victoria. no real sense of period. it may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown.

the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history. on the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront, director jean-marc vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. it's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert, the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life, vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like, yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story, writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. vallée takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria's story without ever over-encumbering it. indeed, while watching vallée's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element; and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes' script. entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with, but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri's original work just as well.yet for all the poignant compositions, lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene, the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life. thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that. between the sweet, budding romance of victoria (emily blunt) and albert (rupert friend) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like (spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany), the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic "nice to look at but dim underneath" affair so common with these outings.in the end, it's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria. it's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance, plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details. of course, it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable. vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur, nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados. somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies the young victoria, sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions; beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.- a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net)

despite some reviews being distinctly luke-warm, i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'mills and boon', so what? it is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. i did feel though that sir john conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. as it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.

i went into this expecting not to like it; i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest, and rather plodding and dull.it's actually far better than that, and i found myself really enjoying it. i don't know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know - married to albert, who died young, and she mourned him ever after. seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating; in fact i found myself wishing i'd seen more of the story, and i imagine we may see a sequel at some point.visually the film is stunning. the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top. the acting is top notch from everybody involved.in a word, it was great!

apart from having the longest reign in british history (63 years), queen victoria also holds two other distinctions. she was, apart from our current queen, the oldest ever british monarch, living to the age of 81. and she was also the youngest ever british (as opposed to english or scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is judi dench in "mrs brown". "the young victoria" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal, sarah duchess of york, whose daughter princess beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.there are three main strands to the plot. the first concerns the intrigues of victoria's mother, the duchess of kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser sir john conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (according to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late duke of kent, was victoria's natural father). the second strand concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert, and the attempts of king leopold of belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the house of saxe-coburg, to which both he and albert belonged). the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history, the bedchamber crisis of 1839, when supporters of the tory party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young queen was perceived to favour the whig party and their leader lord melbourne, even though the whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.scriptwriter julian fellowes is known for his conservative views, and at times i wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the tories, the predecessors of the modern conservative party. their leader robert peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. there may be some truth is these characterisations, but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from william iv's unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration.lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. prince albert, for example, was not injured in edward oxford's attempt on victoria's life, and melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul bettany. king william iv certainly disliked the duchess of kent (who was his sister-in-law), but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the duchess and conroy try to force victoria to sign a "regency order"; the duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the regency act 1830, which provided that she would become regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the provisions of the act.there are also occasional infelicities. in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a "danger! major cliché ahead!" warning. yet in spite of scenes like this, i came to enjoy the film. there were some good performances, especially from miranda richardson as the scheming duchess and mark strong as the obnoxious conroy. it is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with british historical drama. jim broadbent gives an amusing turn as king william, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (although not as disastrously over the top as he was in "moulin rouge").the main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert. blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad widow of windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. her love for albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the british people. (with the exception of george iii, victoria's hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). blunt and friend make "the young victoria" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history. 8/10

the legend of andrei konchalovsky's towering 4 and a half hour poem to siberia is not to begin at once, because it must hold back for space, because it takes its time in roundabout explorations of half-remembered childhood memories in a turn-of-the-century backwoods village, yet the movie goes on picking up steam building in emotional resonance as though even the sounds and images which compose it become imbued by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce tireless quiet dignity that characterizes the soviet working spirit. konchalovsky celebrates soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like soy cuba and invincible the mood turns somber and reflective. news of the revolution reach the secluded siberian village through the grapevine. the fruits of its labor reach it only when a world war calls for the young men to enlist. through all this, konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual, with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiancé who never came back, waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fiancé's father with an axe, the irreverent folly of the fiancé who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late, came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland, the despair and resignation of the middle-aged regional party leader who comes back to his small siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant. the movie segues from decade to decade from the 10's to the 80's with amazing newsreel footage trailing soviet history from the revolution to war famine and the titanic technological achievements of an empire (terrific visuals here! all kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces) but the actual movie focuses on the individual, on triumphs and follies small and big. by the second half a sense of bittersweet fatalism creeps in; of broken lives that never reached fulfillment choking with regret and yearning. "it can't matter", seems like the world is saying, to which konchalovksy answers "it must matter" because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption.yet behind this saga of 'man against landscape' something seems to hover, shadowy, almost substanceless, like the eternal old man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists, sometimes a mere spectactor, sometimes the enigmatic sage; a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters, something invisible seems to lurk. ghosts of the fathers appearing in sepia dreams, repeated shots of a star gleaming in the nightsky, a curious bear, indeed the eternal old man himself; konchalovksy calls for awe and reverence before a mystical land of some other order. in its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them, often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time, and in how the director never allows cynicism to override his humanism, it reminds me of shohei imamura's the profound desires of the gods. when, in a dream scene, alexei tears through the planks of a door on which is plastered a propaganda poster of stalin to reach out at his (dead) father as he vanishes in the fog, the movie hints at the betrayal of the soviet dream, or better yet, at all the things lost in the revolution, this betrayal made more explicit in the film's fiery denouement. the amazing visuals, elegiac and somber with a raw naturalist edge, help seal the deal. by the end of it, an oil derric erupts in flames and the movie erupts in a wild explosion of pure cinema.

for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure. the story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times (i.e. the 1960s).the story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village, who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. his son, by the local beauty, fights the germans during the second world war. when he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealism.this film is long and slow, but utterly logic and very well made. it can be seen in three parts.

it is a story of siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. it is about passion and feelings, about russian soul, and very romantic. this movie is not action packed, it flowes slowely. in second part one can find great songs - russian romances. it is much more better than doctor zhivago. the director of this movie moved to america and made runaway train for example.

i have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take (because of its length and story), i liked it very much. i was impressed first, by the script and then, by the realization of this script. the film takes you on a ride, but that is not an easy, joyful ride; it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people's lives. what i loved was the inner logic the film followed; logic, which just like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end, when i thought about it, all the events and twists made sense. it makes no sense though to try to re-tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time. i also liked very much nikita mikhalkov's character aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics would saw, with restless abandon. what i didn't like about it, was that i think he later played characters that remind me of aleksei in films like "cruel romance" (zhestokij romans, which i actually love) and to some extent in "the insulted and the injured" ("unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "sibiriada" shows, i think, what a great film-maker andrei konchalovski was before he went to hollywood and made forgettable films like "tango and cash" and less forgettable like "runaway train". i would prefer "kurochka ryaba" to them...

i was young film student in 1979 when the union of the soviet filmmakers came to sofia bulgaria and premiered konchalovsky's "siberiade"; tarkosvky's "stalker" and danelia'a "autumn marathon". i was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. then and only then, i saw "siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. way better then bertolucci's "1900". by far!hope andron will somehow get to the negative and make "director's restored version full lenght " someday! on dvd of course! also i fiercely fought in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating soviet film with bad taste! time is on my side.

as someone who was born to a german mother and english father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) i come from unique position. one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the victors of ww2 on the other. this miniseries cannot delve into every single part of hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitler's state of mind. in this the series does quite well. carlyle is very good as is o'toole, i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not do anything on his own. he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. what was going through goebbels, goring and hess's mind? it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. but i hope it will make people research the subject more. it might also make people understand why someone like saddam hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.

first week of may, every year brings back the memories of the holocaust, through movies on televisions. among many movies they showed, this was the one i had not seen.the story is about hilter's life and how he came to power. it starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in germany.the movie was earlier presented as a tv series and later converted into a movie format. scottish actor robert carlyle plays adolf hitler with great guts, conviction and flare to give a real portrayal of this man.it is a good screenplay and narrative, that educates the audiences on the main events that lead hitler into power, and also tries to show the probable psychological make up of hitler. the movie is a biased viewpoint of the director christian duguay  who shows hitler as a one-track, menacing, angry, and shouting person  who had such a strong hold on the germans and people around him. hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction, and there the movie fails to convince hitler's portrayal.even though the venture was for tv, all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie. the production value, sets, costumes, etc. were perfect.there is a lot of criticism of this movie, in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented. but still the movie is gripping, every engaging and entertaining. robert carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does. he is amazingly good  brilliant! i would have liked a more balanced view of hitler's life, because i think, hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of million of germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust. as i have told several times, that  very sadly - our society loves to garland or prosecute one person, as a representative of the society's good or evil respectively.

i don't know what it is with this movies. but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy. of course it's not 100% accurate. it's difficult to make 100% accurate films nowadays when even the "experts" disagree with each other. therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies.so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie. but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast. the series should have been a three part story, his childhood being the first part. but if they didn't have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise that???there's only one real problem i have with this movie and that's the fact that it's told in a history book way. especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened. i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane (more scenes where he doubts himself etc.). noah taylor did that more in the movie 'max' which seem to work better i think. nevertheless i'm glad this was made and own it on dvd. just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his best. 7.5/10

this is a tepid docu-drama that covers no new ground, reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts. for example, munich is a very flat city. so why is it hilly in the movie? for example, the end of the great war in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice. yet it is announced as a surrender. for example, european news vendors did not (and do not) shout headlines as they hawk their papers. yet this strictly american custom is employed in the film. for example, the nazis did not adopt the german eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as hitler delivers one of his stem winders. indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than hitlerian oratory. the movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the munich hoffbrauhaus. it was not. robert carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject. but his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that. these comments are based on the first episode only. one only can hope the second will be better but don't bet on it.

even though ian kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to hitler's life and yes, this is dramatised, but essential. robert carlyle plays hitler during his later years, during this documentary that only deals with hitler from boyhood until he became chancellor of germany, including the night of the long knives. this tv-film (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a series of factors allowed hitler to come to power, e.g. the financial disaster of 1930.the series follows hitler and little else, apart from the lives of fritz gerlich and ernst hanfstaengl. all in all, valuable and filled with interesting actors, yet i feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography; most actors are portrayed in half-body shots which (for me) makes for a theatrical stance, not cinematic. the tempo is at times drowsy, and the film does suffer from it, being approximately 2,5 hours long.

there is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it. this takes the easiest and most shallow route, simply portraying him as a monster. only showing his negative sides, and exaggerating them. "those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it". he was a human being. that may prove tough to some people to accept, but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to. rather than demonizing the man, we ought to try to understand him. otherwise, we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future, or possibly even the present, from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope, as far as damage and misery goes. hate him and what he did, don't make him into something mythical, intentionally or otherwise. frankly, far too much of this mini-series could play "dumb dumb *duuum*!" after or during scenes. the whole thing nods, nudges and winks at the audience, with a clear message of "was this guy evil or what", incorporating every single bad trait(as well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was), letting them appear more or less out of nowhere, and having them be constant throughout his life, not something he came to believe or claimed to. this should never be used to educate. use der untergang(downfall, in english), and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that, instead. this, this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place, and to any and all survivors, not to mention those who died. the cinematic quality? top-notch. it's well-done, through and through, excellent production values, a solid arc to the well-told plot, what characterization does occur is strong and credible, dialog and script are great, all acting performances are masterful(carlyle looks and behaves the role... as it was written... perfectly), the music is well-composed, cinematography and editing are flawless and creative, and this is definitely dramatic, entertaining and riveting. they get dates and many occurrences, and do them justice. if i had been offered to work on this, and did not feel i could be objective enough to have hitler appear as a fully fleshed-out person, i would have declined, citing that as the reason. i don't blame anyone for loathing him. how can you forgive what he did, and are we sure that we should? that is not what i am suggesting. finally, let me point out that, as i write this, we are in a world-wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years, and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of 1929. the two reasons it hasn't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows: governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going, and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another. apart from that, the lesson hadn't been learned. hopefully, it has now. back to this... my suggestion? read a book, non-fiction, dealing with the subject. there are plenty of informative, smart ones. the dvd holds a trailer. i recommend this only to those who know better, and vehemently urge anyone who has watched it, to seek out the truth. 8/10

"hitler, the rise of evil" is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war 2. which makes watching a refreshing experience.i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi-mechanism. of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top. having arrived there, this film ends.when on top, the 'fuhrer' (= german for 'leader') led his germany to the biggest & most devastating war in history of mankind. ending six years later in germany's utter defeat. as a result, germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its prewar soil), and was forced to accept a 44 year-split of its remaining territory. both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, their reputations severely damaged by the many nazi-atrocities inspired by racism.as i said, "hitler, the rise of evil" makes an good watch. set in an acceptable thirties-environment, with (more than) competent acting. in particular peter o'toole's role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out, even adds an extra dimension.my copy of "hitler, the rise of evil" also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films. one is about hitler's personality, the second deals with the forgery of the hitler-diaries. in 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany, damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists.

in christian duguay's movie, hitler: the rise of evil, hitler's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration. it is quite natural for a hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie. even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book, i believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie, making it more interesting. we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary. who cares how did his dog died anyway.throughout the movie, hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals. but he was not portrayed as a super-villain but more like an ambitious politician. i believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective. yes he was a little mad, and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in "inglorious bastards". i believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts.the flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators. even though the movie's focus was around hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers, discussions of people and the songs in a jewish cabaret. also society's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited. struggles of journalist fritz gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all. mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him.another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for jews. in the beginning of the movie, some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial. all of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of jews.in conclusion, hitler: the rise of evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all. if you can stand directors that change history for cash, it is an interesting movie reflecting hitler's personality in a successful way.

as an amateur historian of ww2/nazi germany, i couldn't wait for this to come out on dvd. i missed it when it was first on in 2003. i don't want to repeat what's already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies. a better job could've been done portraying the "charming" hitler. i also had a small problem with some of the casting choices, not so much for their acting, but for their appearances. peter stormare doesn't look much like rohm, why didn't they make babson as hess wear a wig? and my biggest complaint..so much has always been made of hitler's striking blue eyes, why didn't they make carlyle wear blue contacts? on the plus side, i thought the actors who played goring and drexler looked pretty good. again, as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st, history 2nd i don't think a lot of harm will be done.

"hitler: the rise of evil" was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired, and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film.those who criticzed the film, which they hadn't seen, did so with good intentions, based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler. however, they misunderstood the point: to humanize the evil hitler is not sympathize with him. it is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of history's greatest villains were committed by a human being. a sick, diseased maniac, to be sure, but a human being nonetheless. it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again."rise of evil" is highlighted by a brilliant, career best performance from robert carlyle, who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way. carlyle flawlessly captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader, while never letting the impersonation become cartoonish or distance us (something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in "the bunker", another very good made-for-television film). while were are repulsed by hitler's depravity and virulent ant-semitism, carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power the real adolf hitler must have possesed. after all, while else would a nation have followed him?of the various subplots, by far the most compelling features matthew modine as reporter fritz gehrlich, who makes it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and nazism. while modine's performance is a little stilted in part 1, by part 2 he seems to have settled in, the character gives us a real-life hero in a film full of villains. peter stormare and liev schrieber also give strong support.part 1 of this two-part mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy, including a look at hitler's childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits. and in part 2, sections detailing hitler's relationship's with his niece, and his mistress eva braun, are less successful than the central plot, but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional state.ultimately, no film about hitler can make us understand him. the average person is, thankfully, incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people. "hitler: the rise of evil" tries less to make us understand hitler, and more to make us understand how he came to be power. it is an important story that must be told, and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions, and the capability of doing anything but good.9 out of 10. *** 1/2

i agree with many of the negative reviews posted here, for reasons i will go into later on. but this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of hitler's world.peter stormare is perfect as ernst rohm, the brutal brownshirt leader. each scene he has with hitler is explosive! hitler is so evil he dominates everyone but the thuggish, primitive rohm -- and he clearly digs rohm for just that reason. the interplay between stormare and carlisle illuminates the way hitler relished rohm's brutality, but later sacrificed him for political reasons.jena malone turns in a heartrending performance as geli raubal, hitler's doomed niece and the victim of his unspeakable perversions. without revealing any of the sexual filth directly, jena malone plays out all the horror of the slow extinction of a young girl's spirit. she uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come. and she's brilliant! zoe telford very nearly matches jena malone with her portrayal of eva braun. eva is clearly sick, cruel and heartless -- but at the same time almost pitiably dependent on her adolph's twisted tenderness. the aborted lovemaking scene between them (hinting at the spine tingling truth of hitler's enormous self-loathing) is both chilling and erotic.liev schrieber gives a deliciously weasel-like performance as putzi hanfstaengel, the spineless man-about-town who is seduced by hitler's promises of wealth and power. while a brute like rohm simply loves the idea of crushing skulls under his boots, schrieber's character is one of many germans who abhors nazi violence but can't resist the quick and easy route to money and power. his weak-willed fawning over hitler soon loses him the respect of his wife, played with style and sensuality by the stunning and regal julianna margulies. they provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal.these performances carry the mini series along, easily overcoming occasional weaknesses in the script. there is one exception. regrettably, matthew modine's acting chops just aren't up to snuff. his noble lunk-haid journalist ruins every scene he has -- the viewer can hardly wait for rohm's brown-shirts to stomp that smug, righteous look off his ignorant, corn-pone low-rent hollywood golden boy face. but the story still works.now in regard to the factual inaccuracies of the script -- hitler's perversions and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant, compelling drama. but the battlefield record of corporal hitler is badly distorted. as if afraid the audience can't handle the idea of evil and courage in the same person, the writers make hitler look like a whining coward who "begged" for an iron cross. as if anyone in the kaiser's army could get a medal just by whining about it! the movie makes it look as if hitler were a coward in the trenches, when he was a fearless soldier. they also suggest his comrades despised him, when in reality he was widely admired by officers and enlisted men alike. the depressing thing is that the mini-series succeeds so well in representing hitler as a monster in honest ways -- but they just couldn't resist the cheap shot.all in all, however, hitler: rise of evil is a soaring success highlighted by powerful performances.

tenchu aka. hitokiri- directed by hideo gosha - starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs (together with goyokin, hara kiri & rebellion) to the best chambara movies existing.its the story about shintaro katsu (who plays okada izo) working for nakadei, who wants to become the daymio. okada, being the "cleaner" for nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to nakadei.but there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!!(tenchu means heavens punishment)

this is one of the best of the genre. i saw it twice about 25yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then. it rivals the zatoichi series (also starring katsu) in exciting swordplay.

gosha's last great film of the 1960's. a resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his films, gosha teamed up with shintaro katsu (of zatoichi fame) to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty. "tenchu" (heavenly judgment) is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or "traitors" to the cause. katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride. anybody who questions the politician is labeled a "traitor" and becomes an assassination target.one of the best photographed films ever, many shots are incredible compositions of form, color and light. the fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. the blood becomes a part of the color palette gosha uses for his images. gorgeous and disturbing. while the personal story is simple to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it. the few drawbacks to the film are the music track, the length and katsu's occasional scenery chewing. he has a drunken scene that's way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk.downbeat but one of the great chambara films.

this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist, who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan. really, i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background.shintaro katsu (also known as the original zatoichi) gives a superb performance as izo okada, one of the four hitokiri(=human slayer) of the bakumatsu. he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth. in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei (played by tatsuya nakada = ryonosuke out of sword of doom). hanpei is a ultra-nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro-west politicians in order to achieve his political goals. izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore. okada's killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening. first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto ( who is a samurai who rejects violence) does he change his ideas and views on life. but too late....watch the movie to see the end of izo okada...shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance. each actor reaches up to their role. the sword-fights a very unique and fast...probably faster than several movies nowadays...check it out if you have the chance!!!

it's a testament to gosha's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece, goyokin, in the same year, 1969. and it's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public (compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa), that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them.shintaro katsu is okada izo: mad dog killer, loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi, played by another genre stalwart, tatsuya nakadai. the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate. the historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with japan's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion. it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate, but it's not essential by any means. the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well.as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years (the late 60's) the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty. style however is never decorative for gosha - it is always employed in the service of story. and speaking of story, hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada. as most chambara protagonists, izo finds himself in a moral double-bind, torn between giri (obligation) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is. in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self-advancement. lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan. the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes, the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self. it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a "nameless" drifter without past or future, torazo the vagrant. although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbo's mold, it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego, ambition and self-dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself. hitokiri ends (which i won't reveal here) in the best way any story can end: both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh, a last sardonic remark in the face of death.

hitokiri (which translates roughly as "assassination"), a/k/a "tenchu" which translates roughly as "divine punishment") showcases hideo gosha at the top of his form. do not miss this one, or gosha's other classic, goyokin! hitokiri is not only one of gosha's best films, it's one of the best "samurai/chambara" films ever made, and perhaps one of the best japanese films ever exported.be warned, all of the intricate plot details in hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century japanese history. even so, the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. as per the norm for gosha, hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of "loyalty to one's lord" vs. "doing the right thing". however, gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication, that it's really _the_ movie to see (along with goyokin, of course).i suppose it breaks down like this: if you want a simpler, more action-oriented tale, you might want to see goyokin. however, if you want a more thoughtful, multilayered (albeit grim) drama, see this one.(ok, ok, essentially, the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either (1) working to reform, yet retain, the tokugawa shogunate, and (2) those who are trying to install the emperor meiji as the supreme ruler of japan. of course, those clans working "for" emperor meiji were often less interested in "reforming" japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the "new world order". ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the meiji government. it's ironic twists like this -- gosha's big on irony -- that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet.)what distinguishes "hitokiri" from gosha's other movies is gosha's mature sense of cinematography. every shot is thoughtfully composed, and (much like kubrick's barry lyndon) each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition. of course, this is typical gosha. hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops, including(as with goyokin) many riveting seascapes. just watch the opening sequence, and you're hooked! make no mistake, this is no english period piece: hitokiri is extremely violent (don't say you weren't warned).what else, other than cool camera work, makes hitokiri stand out? the performances seem (to me) a bit more subtle in this one. katsu shintaro (of zatoichi/hanzo the razor fame) turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist/antihero, okada izo. katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain. throughout the movie, you're never quite sure if you're engaged or revolted by okada's character. at the same time, katsu's portrayal of okada's ravenous hunger for respect, and his later pathetic attempts at redemption, seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy/sympathy. of course, after seeing nakadai tatsuya play the tortured hero in "goyokin", it's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in "hitokiri". he's just perfect, there's nothing more to say!as a final note, perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans, don't miss the last screen appearance of mishima yukio (yes, the closeted gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering japanese military personnel he "kidnapped" in 1970, and had a movie on his life and work made by paul schrader), who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable (for an assassin) shinbei tanaka.

i wouldn't be surprised if soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd. still, part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of cuba. i liked del toro's interpretation of che guevara's personality. and the actor who plays castro, bichir, also did a great job, against all odds. it's clear soderbergh doesn't look down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. some of the more important historical aspects contradict what i've read. to my knowledge castro did not court the soviet union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the united states were exhausted. but on other aspects he is right on, especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control. the country's treasury was left empty.

the year is 1964. ernesto "che" guevara, having been a cuban citizen for the last five years,disappears from the face of the earth,leaving a glum fidel castro to announce that he is probably dead,when in truth, he has left cuba to move to bolivia to live an assumed identity. whilst living in la paz,guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt,bourgeois government there. once again,steven soderberg takes up where 'che:part one' leaves off (only better this time). the pacing is more on target,the job of acting is ever so fine (including a turn by a sickly looking benecio del toro,as che guevara). suffice it to say,it's probably best if you see both films,to get the true story of guevara & what kind of a man he was (i had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one screening----talk about a long haul!). as with 'che-part 1:the argentine',this film has no mpaa rating, but contains enough salty language & violence to easily snag it an 'r'.

i'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered, and watched. when i talk about 'the film' i am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other, as they should be.thank you jon anderson, steven soderbergh & benicio del toro.this film is a refreshing, bold, gritty and true film. and, it hearkens a new style of film making. no faux drama. no swelling sound track. not faux documentary style. just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts. i have been reading jon anderson's "che guevara: a revolutionary life" and recently finished fidel's auto biography, and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly. but i have to say that it is jon anderson's exhaustive, penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone. anderson was consultant on this film (or these 2 films). what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean. no swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama, and even more importantly; no fake documentary shaky camera. just square shots and straight forward shooting style. the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle. benicio del toro should be given full honors for this, i never doubted him as che throughout the film... not once. he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this. some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole. but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film: it doesn't try to be everything. it doesn't try to 'tell the story'. a person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 hours. this is one of the subtle beauties of this film, it resists that temptation, and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che, his developing militaristic mind and the forces around him. it focuses on 3 slices of time: the battle to over throw batista, che's u.n. speech and the gorilla preparations in bolivia. "motorcycle diaries" already told his young man side, and i applaud s. soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead. i keep referring to jon anderson's book and the film stays true. the only weak link for me are the casting (not the performance) of matt damon. in a film so loaded with true to life performances, an american, (matt damon) playing a bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well, but after so much care in the casting, this was an over-site. small and completely forgiven. the reality that the rest of the casting gives you, and most notably benicio del toro's amazing job, put's this film at the top of my list.the fact that this film went almost straight to video say's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the 'revolutionized cuba' to become what it might have, are still at work keeping it's story quiet. if not out of clandestine muffling, then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic.this is a must see film, and jon anderson's "che guevara: a revolutionary life" is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40's, 50's & 60's that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors, and the effects it fostered.

possibly the most brilliant thing about che: part two, as we begin to integrate it with part one in our minds, is that there is no clarification of why che chose to confidentially abscond from cuba after the revolution, no allusion to his experience in the congo, no clarification of why he chose bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat, no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across south america, which walter salles has given prominent familiarity. extraordinary focus is given to che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions. yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals, to establish involved relationships. he is reasonably unreasonable. che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind. but there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men. it is the concept.in part 1, in cuba, the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages, given food and cover, supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution. here, in bolivia, not much understanding is apparent. villagers expose him. they protect government troops, not his own. when he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system, his audience appears uninterested. you cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply. soderbergh shows u.s. military advisers working with the bolivians, but doesn't fault the united states for che's collapse. che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it.in showcasing both wars, soderbergh doesn't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results. che's men attack and are attacked. they exchange fire with faraway assailants. there is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat, its death toll not paused for. this is not a war movie. it is about one man's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure. there is no elaborate cinematography. soderbergh looks firmly at che's inflexible dedication. there are remarkable sporadic visceral shots, but being few they are all the more powerful, such as che's pov shot during his final beats. there is an abundance of the terrain, where these men live for weeks at a time, and the all-consuming effect is of languor, guevara himself having malaria part of the time.benicio del toro, one of the film's producers, gives a champion's performance, not least because it's modest. he isn't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes. in cuba, he arises in conquest, in bolivia, he falls to the reverse, and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair. del toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude. you may think the film is too long. i think there's a genuine cause for its breadth. guevara's affairs in cuba and particularly bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches, but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane. in the end, che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie, one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means.

part ii or formerly known as guerilla, is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara. once again, i'm impressed by the cause-and-effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories. we're reminded again and again that the lead character, che guevara is an argentine. some of the men in fidel's army chose not to take orders from a foreigner and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia, he doesn't get much respect from his new army and the natives either, only because he's a foreigner.as far as technical goes, i think part ii would've been more helpful if before everything else, right after the display of the map, it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what he's set himself on doing, to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they don't work in bolivia. it is clear now in this segment, that che is not as charismatic as fidel castro. in bolivia, he's dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it. it's said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love.. well, they don't give a damn that much about their country so it's a tough sell. it's excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his vision.i like one particular scene that illustrates che's deteriorating condition, a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it, and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there, he forgets he's a doctor, and he becomes this desperate soldier who's stabs his own horse. his army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led. but at the same time, the film drags, it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you'll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part, you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another, but maybe that is the intention of part ii, if so.. then it definitely works. standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of che's last breath. this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn, why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling.

the first one meant victory. this one means defeat. it takes place in a bolivia, there the guerillas are sick and wary and don't meet that much sympathy from the farmers. if you know your 60s history, you understand how it ends. you will understand it even without that knowledge.del toro is once again splendid. he goes on building this icon about the revolutionary who remains the same, regardless of success or failure. that's what guevara is according to the legend, but still it's so well acted.the documentary feeling is there around the icon, which is one of the greatest achievements in this big soderbergh project. he has succeeded.

from what i've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to part 1. initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be. soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che's life that he started in part 1. part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. it is not soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of che's life had completely different outcomes. he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. the film is far from perfect. it is probably too long. at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. in part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. che's capture and death are dealt with well. the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish. benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian. so if you've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2.

i watched part one two days ago and today i saw part two. of course the two parts are worlds apart so i am a little shaken by all that i just saw. i felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of che's death; for me, it clouded the entire movie. i suppose that is exactly what soderbergh wanted us to feel, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. part two was so downbeat compared to, again an inevitability but in cuba it was positive and in bolivia it was so negative. the politics of the movement in bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically. for me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the bolivian official where that official questions che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. i had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict, argentine versus bolivian. i thought soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves. i was struck by how hard it would be to try something as che tried. i guess it is all in the timing; is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement; in bolivia there wasn't. che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to fidel read at the beginning of the film: if not now, when, 50 years from now. a very thought provoking and well done film; make every effort to see it.

i've read up a little bit on che before watching this film and you wanna know something, he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other latin americans in general! now, i don't know about others, but to me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share. however, the powerful elite obviously weren't going to go for that. so, rather than understanding what che guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution. it didn't work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off. a good example of this was when castro continued his leadership in cuba. as far as i'm concerned and as che said it himself right before he died: "if you kill me, that's fine. but you're only killing a man, you'll never kill the cause!" i couldn't have said it any better myself.but ... anyways.... that's why i give this film a 7 out of 10.

it surprises me that i actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks "che: parts 1 & 2". why? because if my cuban exile parents would ever found out i saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the cuban revolution, i would be grounded for life. hey wait? i am an adult, they can't ground me no mas. director steven soderbergh, and newbie commie (sorry steven, but i had to take soder shots here) divides the movie in two partes on commander ernesto "che" guevara's revolutionary life. "che: part 1" presents how che in the mid 1950's joined fidel castro's guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow cuban president fulgencio batista's regime; which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them, but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many cubans as it revolted into communism. "che: part 2" presents che trying to revolutionize the t-shirt industry by pitching t-shirts with his appalling bearbado face to t-shirt manufacturers. ok, i am che-chatting a lot of crap towards your way! i meant to say the 'che: part 2" focuses on che in the late 60's trying to bring back the revolution, this time to a poverty-stricken bolivia, but with far different results. in fact, che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the bolivian militia in 1967. soderbergh does not include the in-between time of those two instances in che's life when he commanded the despicable la cabana fortress prison in cuba, where he mass murdered many cubans who opposed communism. that is where i think soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious guevara really was. i did decide to see "che" in hopes that soderbergh would not glamorize him, but instead present how disturbed he really was. unfortunately, soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present guevara as a revolutionary hero, which he was not. he was a sick man who thank god is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel. now, i do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that benicio del toro's performance as che was extremely commanding, and worthy of merit. and that demian bichir was a haunting dead-ringer as fidel castro in his meticulous performance. but the rest of the cast of "che" was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying guerilla soldiers. and as much as i do admire matt damon, why did sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a spanish-speaking cameo performance portraying a bolivian delegate? soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly "too much talk and not enough action" in 4 hours and 30 minutes. we have had too much of che already, even posthumously with those ridiculous t-shirts, so why give us too much more of him? but i guess when you have the del toro by the horns (as you did here steven), i guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing "che: parts 1 &2". *** average

che: part one was a fascinating experiment, which did not only tell a very interesting story, but it also tried to do something different with the "biopic" genre.che: part two is the excellent culmination of this experiment.this movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one, from the extraordinary performances (specially from benicio del toro) to steven soderbergh's brilliant direction, without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics.that is what i admire from soderbergh's experiments...they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the times.the final message from this film is perfect, and it includes everything we have been told about che guervara's life.the only fail i found on che: part two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant.in summary, i give che: part two a very enthusiastic recommendation because, as the first one, it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the spectator and leaves us thinking.

i came to watch guerrilla, part two of steven soderbergh's biopic of che guevara, without having seen the preceding film and without more than a cursory knowledge of che's life. at the same time i was rather apprehensive that this would be both a heavy-going history lesson and an unrepentant love-letter to the iconic revolutionary. as it turns out, this film far exceeded my expectations.guerrilla works remarkably well as a standalone film. the story of che's failed attempt to lead a revolution in bolivia, then under military rule, is a compelling tragedy. the initial impetus brought by che's arrival incognito to lead the guerrilla war is lost as misfortune follows misfortune. the odds stack up against the revolutionaries. us backing for the bolivian army, hostile conditions in the rainforest, suspicious locals and che's failing health are just some of the difficulties which beset the nascent rebellion.soderbergh's portrayal of che is largely uncritical, but this film is no hagiography. the style is refreshingly undramatic, with a subtle and effective soundtrack by alberto iglesias adding quiet drama to many scenes. che is undoubtedly the centre of the film but there are very few close-ups of his face and we are encouraged to see the people fighting alongside him and sometimes against him too. where soderbergh wishes to demonstrate che's virtues we see it in small episodes such as the loyal acolyte who upbraids two fellow guerrillas when they question che's leadership, and emphasises the sacrifice that he has made in leaving behind cuba to fight again for revolution.the direction throughout is superb. part two feels tightly edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a great deal through images without the need for a narrator to spell things out for the audience. at the start of the film we see a few short clips of lavish parties in post-revolutionary cuba, immediately furnishing us with ideas as to why che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country. later on, the portrayal of guerrillas marching through the unending rainforests stands out as a strikingly beautiful scene and helps to create a feeling of the enormity of the task before this tiny band of revolutionaries.if there is a problem with the film it is the distance between the viewer and che, which, though it does allow us to appreciate the context of the insurgency and the people around him, makes it hard for us to understand him better as a person. true, benicio del toro is utterly convincing in the lead role  so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are watching an actor and not the man himself. however, watching guerrilla as a standalone film means that we are given precious little insight into what is shaping che's thoughts, words and actions. it is to be hoped that this is more to the fore in the first part of soderbergh's biopic (i cannot comment on that yet), and certainly the strength of part two is making me look forward eagerly to seeing the prequel.

i sat through both parts of che last night, back to back with a brief bathroom break, and i can't recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly. i'd had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real 'thing' about directors, producers and editors who keep putting over blown, over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole, 2 to 2.5 hours is about right for a movie. so 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise. but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully  i might say lovingly  made movie and i'm really glad i saw it. director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision. the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself.if there is a person on the planet who doesn't know, ernesto 'che' guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the 1959 cuban revolution. when i was a kid in the 1960s, che's image was everywhere; on bedroom wall posters, on t shirts, on magazine covers. che's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever. if the famous images are to be relied on, then che was a very good looking guy, the epitome of revolutionary romanticism. had he been butt ugly, i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination? of course dying young helps.movies have been made about che before (notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che, touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics) but i don't think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end, and this two-parter is an ambitious project. i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind.the first movie (the agentine) shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un. cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren't. the second film (guerilla) picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement. the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest. as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film. benicio del toro is excellent as che, a part he seems born to play.personally, i felt that the argentine (ie part one) was much easier to watch and more 'entertaining' in the strictly movie sense, because it is upbeat. they are winning; the revolution will succeed. che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants, workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause. the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat. in much the same way that the recent valkyrie - while being a good movie - was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure, so i felt the same about part two of che (guerilla). we know at the outset that he dies, we know he fails. it is frustrating because the way the story is told, it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed; che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans. he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other, perhaps more successful, enterprises. the movie does not romanticise him too much. he kills people, he executes, he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on, he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children.but overall, an excellent exercise in classic movie making. one note; as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one, it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy. i almost turned to my husband and said so, but hesitated, thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place. as we left the theatre he turned to me and said "didn't you think the end was like butch cassidy!"

many reviews i've read reveals that most people tend to like part one better than part two. i feel exactly the opposite. part one played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing che guevara's personality through different types of film stock, different locations, and cutting back and forth between an interview and the cuban revolution. for the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting. in part two, che enters bolivia, and along with changing geographical location, the rules and the structure changes. gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks, the "documentary realism" and the treatises. instead, now we are literally trapped with che in a desaturated, depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option. i posit that it's the dark turn of che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer part one to part two.the change in geographic location also signifies, for me at least, that che: part one and che: part two are, in fact, the second two acts of a three act structure begun by motorcycle diaries. motorcycle diaries is che's coming-of-age (or more appropriately, coming-of-ideals) in argentina, che: part one is his military leadership in cuba, and che: part two is his downfall in bolivia. these movies do not completely illustrate his life (we're missing his experiences in guatamala and, more importantly in my opinion, his post-cuban revolution executions), but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol. he both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression, and revolutionary failings in the post-world war ii third world countries and their hindering by such activities as, um, the cias meddling.but, yet again, all of that is projected on-screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches, but through a much more intimate, suffering portrayal of che at the end of his thread and his life. again, the rules have changed, and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all. the number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated, shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape, an existential hell, where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death. it's just not that easy of a movie to watch, but it's very effective.--polarisdib

following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably- conducted the whole thing.yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. here, the basic structure of part one is echoed backthere's the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note. this difference, in combination with the similarities to part one, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.indeed, everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. in fact, upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one, and title the review as a whole, yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.with that said, i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that. with a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves, che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.- a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net)

part two picks up... not where the last film left off. as part of the quasi-conventionality of steven soderbergh's epic 4+ hour event, che's two stories are told as classic "rise" and "fall" scenarios. in part two, che guevara, leaving his post as a bureaucrat in cuba and after a failed attempt in the congo (only in passing mentioned in the film), goes down to bolivia to try and start up another through-the-jungle style revolution. things don't go quite as well planned, at all, probably because of che's then notorious stature as a communist and revolutionary, and in part because of america's involvement on the side of the bolivian government, and, of course, that castro wasn't really around as a back-up for che.as it goes, the second part of che is sadder, but in some ways wiser than the first part. which makes sense, as guevara has to endure low morale from his men, betrayals from those around him, constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants, and by ultimately the enclosing, larger military force. but what's sadder still is that guevara, no matter what, won't give in. one may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw- maybe both- but it's also clear how one starts to see che, if not totally more fully rounded, then as something of a more sympathetic character. true, he did kill, and executed, and felt justified all the way. and yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity; the sequence where guevara's health worsens without medicine, leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse, marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year.again, soderbergh's command of narrative is strong, if, on occasion, slightly sluggish (understandable due to the big running time), and one or two scenes just feel totally odd (matt damon?), but these are minor liabilities. going this time for the straight color camera approach, this is almost like a pure militia-style war picture, told with a great deal of care for the men in the group, as well as guevara as the lord-over this group, and how things dwindle down the final scene. and as always, del-toro is at the top of his game, in every scene, every beat knowing this guy so well- for better and for worse- that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible. overall, the two parts of che make up an impressive package: history as drama in compelling style, good for an audience even if they don't know che or, better, if they don't think highly of him. it's that special. 8.5/10

ironically the most talked-about american film in the 2008 new york film festival is 98% in spanish. the extra-long film's controversy began at the cannes festival. there were love-hate notices, and considerable doubts about commercial prospects. as consolation the star, benicio del toro, got the best actor award there. i'm talking about steven soderbergh's 'che,' of course. that's the name it's going by in this version, shown in new york as at cannes in two 2-hour-plus segments without opening title or end credits. 'che' is certainly appropriate since ernesto "che" guevara is in almost every scene. del toro is impressive, hanging in reliably through thick and thin, from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two, appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations, even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into bolivia. it's a terrific performance; one wishes it had a better setting.if you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours, with an intermission between the two sections, there are rewards. there's an authentic feel throughout--fortunately soderbergh made the decision to film in spanish (though some of the actors, oddly enough in the english segments especially, are wooden). you get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare, che style, was like: the teaching, the recruitment of campesinos, the morality, the discipline, the hardship, and the fighting--as well as che's gradual morphing from company doctor to full-fledged military leader. use of a new 9-pound 35 mm-quality red "digital high performance cine camera" that just became available in time for filming enabled dp peter andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold, but at times still sing, and are always sharp and smooth.the film is in two parts--soderbergh is calling them two "films," and the plan is to release them commercially as such. first is 'the argentine,' depicting che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of havana in the late 50's, and the second is 'guerrilla,' and concerns che's failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to spearhead a revolution, a fruitful mission that led to guevara's capture and execution in 1967. the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and, i think, shot first. producer laura bickford says that part two is more of a thriller, while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. yes, but both parts have a lot in common--too much--since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country. guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the bolivian revolt was doomed from the start. the group of cubans who tried to lead it didn't get a friendly reception from the bolivian campesinos, who suspected foreigners, and thought of the cuban communists as godless rapists. there is a third part, a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of che's speech at the united nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time, but that is inter-cut in the first segment. the first part also has fidel and is considerably more upbeat, leading as it does to the victory in santa clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of fulgencio batista in cuba.during 'guerilla' i kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality european-style miniseries, which might begin with a shortened version of walter salles's 'motorcycle diaries' and go on to take us to guevara's fateful meeting with fidel in mexico and enlistment in the 26th of july movement. there could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions. this is far from a complete picture of the man, his childhood interest in chess, his lifelong interest in poetry, the books he wrote; even his international fame is only touched on. and what about his harsh, cruel side? really what soderbergh is most interested in isn't che, but revolution, and guerrilla warfare. the lasting impression that the 4+ hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich. someone mentioned being reminded of terrence malick's 'the tin red line,' and yes, the meandering, episodic battle approach is similar; but 'the thin red line' has stronger characters (hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides che), and it's a really good film. this is an impressive, but unfinished and ill-fated, effort.this 8-years-gestating, heavily researched labor of love (how many more ocean's must come to pay for it?) is a vanity project, too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries. radical editing--or major expansion--would have made it into something more successful, and as it is it's a long slog, especially in the second half.it's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down, though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken--but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.

neatly skipping over everything from the coup in cuba to his undercover entry into bolivia, part two of soderbergh's portrayal of che guevara is that of the tragic hero. as with che  part one, this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy, so why was the film (and particularly benicio del toro's performance) so loudly praised at cannes?james rocchi, for instance, called it, a work of art that's, "not just the story of a revolutionary," but, "a revolution in and of itself." the guardian's peter bradshaw called it a "flawed masterpiece." i return to my original contention for part one  that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure. and in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role-models, could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one, even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life? this is the psychological hero enshrined by the great scottish essayist, thomas carlyle, in his seminal book, heroes and hero worship. heroes can be real or imaginary (or somewhere in-between). but should genuinely inspire us to higher goals, a higher purpose. compare this with the unrealistic 'heroes' of standard western storytelling: where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely-believable reward  usually everlasting love or material wealth  as if by divine studio intervention. real heroes have an excess of moral courage  not lost ark dare-devilishness or james bond super-toys. they rise, and empower others to rise, to be the best that they can be. in part one, che succeeds. in part two, he fails. it is not for want of moral courage but since a) not all good plans can succeed and b) being human, mistakes are inevitable.guevara's intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed. it is a serious miscalculation.high in the mountains from la paz, the colours are breathtaking. there is an air of mise-en-scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in che - part one (the u.s. would not allow soderbergh to film in cuba.) visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking red cameras. this is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital. designed for flexibility and functionality, the package weighs a mere 9 lbs. "shooting with red is like hearing the beatles for the first time," says soderbergh. "red sees the way i see . . . so organic, so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena  light." if che had stopped with the successful cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility. that he fails in bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered, not the political triumph. critics will say  and with some justification - that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin-pot dictatorships. his development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves (and have since been used for both).but for all its praiseworthiness, the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension. we stumble from one escapade to another, knowing that he will eventually meet his death. i found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter. but the work that has gone into this  interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of guevara's ex-comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the bolivian operations  make the film a commendable achievement. it might not be top-flight entertainment, but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history.there is also another very important point in the che 'hero' figure here. it's about failure. that if you try your utmost, even if you fail, your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage. one could cynically call it a 'martyr' complex, and it is found, of course, in many religious figures as well. but che does not 'sacrifice' himself. he does what he does best, to the best of his not inconsiderate ability, and so provides an example. success or failure in any particular instance become mere details.with the u.s.'s longstanding and illegal blockade of cuba (all in the name of 'freedom'), i am tempted to write that che parts 1 & 2 are too good to be wasted on the u.s. but that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid. one must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders. whatever its faults, it rehabilitates soderbergh from the populist nonsense of oceans 11.but if you haven't heard of che guevara or seen part one, or if you can't get past the phrase 'murderous marxist' without frothing at the mouth, i might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film. the same can be said for many who have, and can.

a lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining (ignoring it is based on a true story) or ranting against a film that glorifies che (which it really doesn't). this film is very close to jon anderson's definitive bio on che and gets the story right. soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was che's bolivian adventure. you really get the impression of the total timidity and bewilderment of the bolvian peasant to che's revolutionary ideas or of the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the terrain. sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there but that was how it happened. so don't go into this movie expecting a rambo shoot em up, its a true story!

i love cinema so what i'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply. i had given a thumbs down to "che, parts 1 and 2" without having seen the film. terrible i know. but i felt into a trap perpetrated by...who? i don't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and, no matter how smart i think i am, i fell into it. but, thankfully, i bumped into an argeninean film director, martin donovan, a man i love and admire. when i told him i wasn't going to see it because i knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and donovan is a pacifist! he took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. i went to see both parts straight away and, "che, part 1 and 2" is the best film i've seen in 2008. it is, of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. the regard for its audience is something that we're not used to anymore. i don't know if we ever were. riveting, moving, without concessions and benicio del toro is just extraordinary. we can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. the humanity of the man is overwhelming. so, thank you martin donovan once again for educating me so honestly. bravo del toro, bravo soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film. don't commit the mistake i was about to commit. go see it, now, on the big screen

i really wanted to like this film and i don't think i was terribly disappointed. being an american history teacher, i felt an obligation, almost, to see this film and as far as the history went, it wasn't bad. sure there were a few mistakes here and there (especially with the timeline--the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year--not over six years of actual fighting), but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent. unfortunately, the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist. for the most part, it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed "tacked on"--like a plot device instead of a real honest-to-goodness romance. in fact, as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of "love at fist sight", it was kind of annoying the more i think about it.however, in spite of this romance, the film is truly interesting and inspiring---plus, in so many ways it seems as if the much later film, the patriot, was copied from this griffith film!!! both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians--and both having the secret intention of using this as a "springboard" to starting their own nation in the america!!! the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas. it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d. w. griffith for the story ideas. it just doesn't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other.ps--despite me liking this film and some other of griffith's films, he does deserve to once again "burn in hell" for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film! this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his films--especially in birth of a nation. i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was a-ok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this "quaint institution" (don't get mad at me--this is meant as sarcasm).

i waited until the 4th of july to write this because . . . well . . . because it just feels right to be doing it on this day.in 1924 d.w. griffith needed a hit, he had not had a big one since orphans of the storm (1921). he'd been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences. he was planning a film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution (dar) who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution. this movie is the result. by the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn't a trace of patrick henry anywhere.we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in a love story with patriot farmer nathan (neil hamilton) falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague (carol dempster, a leading lady for griffith for many years). complicating matters is the fact that nancy's father hates nathan . . . well not just nathan, he hates all rebels. it does not help matters when, during a skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan's arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy's dad!paralelling the love story is the (mostly true but partially embellished) story of capt. walter butler (lionel barrymore) a renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one. with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire.comparisons with birth of a nation (1915) are inevitable. the montague family might just as well be the cameron's from the earlier film while nathan could be a part of the stoneman family. the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to a scene in birth of a nation with the attacking army, in this case the redcoats, storming a trench packed with patriots. the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man's land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon. amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in. something is clearly missing. it isn't scope, g.w. "billy" bitzer's camera work is quite good. maybe what is missing is . . . dare i say it . . . sincerity?the brutality of capt. butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen. don't expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance (1916). in one scene butler's second in command, capt. hare (louis wolhiem) gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist. we see only the beginning of the deed, for the remainder the camera focuses on hare's face as he obviously has a good time doing this. lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912. a story goes that he approached griffith for work and d.w., knowing the reputation of his famous family, said "i am not hiring stage actors." to which lionel replied "and i am nothing of the kind, sir!" he makes a very good and quite believable villain. louis wolhiem appeared with lionel's older brother john three times; in sherlock holmes and dr. jekyll and mr. hyde (both 1920) and later in the tempest (1927). as capt. hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also.neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and "i was scared to death.". he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over. mr. griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him. she refused and soon left his stock company, after which her star status gradually waned.speaking of horses, one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere's ride. he rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce "to arms! the regulars are coming!" but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground! i am amazed griffith did not do another take.so is america a classic? yes! don't wait for july 4th to see it, it is enjoyable anytime.

slow but beautifully-mounted story of the american revolution. griffith's story-telling seems a lot less heavy-handed than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action. lionel barrymore is an utter swine, neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is.... well, carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period, but she doesn't show up often enough to slow the pace and drama.note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released, but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes. however, the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hours.far better in terms of story-telling than sound versions, such as the patriot. while not quite in the league of griffith's best, such as way down east and broken blossoms, an excellent way to spend a couple of hours.

in mexico this movie was aired only in paytv. dietrich bonhoeffer's life, is a true example about a good german and specially, about a good man. the conversations between tukur's character and the nazi prosecutor are specially interesting. a true ideas' war: two different germans, both with faith in there believes. bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual; ulrich tukur is outstanding as bonhoeffer. i recommended this film a lot, specially in this difficult times for the planet. in mexico we don't know a lot about pastor bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero.

i watched, entranced and mesmerized, by the vocal and physical acting. the roles each character played were done with excellence.the lyrics,the words, every gesture, the sunrise, told it all.the movie spoke to me. it enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind. who believes in peace and gentle behavior. i was also held in disbelieve, by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed. power without grace, is demented and without feelings. to want power at the cost of mankind, is so unbelievable. this movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world. and, it is with sadness that i think of them. i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all. may this movie be blessed.

despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced. presented in digestible (as digestible as war can be) episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time. eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u.s. the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year.

this is a fantastic series first and foremost. it is very well done and very interesting. as a huge wwii buff, i had learned a lot before seeing this series. one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver. i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr. overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike.

this was by far the best war documentary ever made. from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in oradour-sur-glane 'the day the soldiers came'. to the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over japan, i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in 1974. each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. this whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that bigotry, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.

i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it. i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered. this is just how a doco should be, unbiased and factual. the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic. the only other series that i have found equal to this is 'die deutschen panzer'.i only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series, then they might make some great war movies.note. band of brothers, saving private ryan, letters from iwo jima, flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some i'd recommend

i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again, on dvd, over thirty years later. the pictures over the opening credits have never left me. it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it. my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we always discussed the programme afterwards. it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our school's public exams!sir laurence olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect. i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war. i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it. maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated, although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imagine.buy it!

this excellent series, narrated by laurence olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the end of world war 2. the origins are not entirely examined fully from germany's fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a 26-part series with so much to cram in. apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a world war 2 buff/fan. episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, britain, germany, japan, russia and the u.s.a. were quite eye-opening. showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. i'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (of which it could be said i am one at 47!).certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with frank whittle's experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor's combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262 - especially as the v-1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2. this is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more barren old science. but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated. a series to own as a box set in history terms, on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud.

i remember watching this in the 1970s - then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library.with a nearly 30 year hiatus, i have come to another conclusion. most of the principals interviewed in this series - some at the center of power like traudl junge (hitler's secretary),karl doenitz (head of germany's navy) anthony eden (uk) - are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on.from generals and admirals to sergeants, russian civilians, concentration camp survivors, all are on record here. i can remember the lord mountbatten interview (killed in the 1970s) this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work - well deserved.seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set.this is the only "10" i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with a little time...

the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2. the 24 episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it. the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power, and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world. they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war, and the holocaust. one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. all of you must watch this. perfection! 10/10

as so many others have written, this is a wonderful documentary. here is a list of the 'chapters' for anyone interested: 1: a new germany: 1933-1939 2: distant war, september 1939-may 1940 3: france falls, may-june 1940 4: alone, may 1940-may 1941 5: barbarossa, june-december 1941 6: banzai, japan, 1931-1942 7: on our way, usa, 1939-1942 8: desert north africa, 1940-1943 9: stalingrad, june 1942-february 1943 10: wolfpack 11: red star the soviet union, 1941-1943 12: whirlwind bombing germany, september 1939 13: tough old gut 14: its a lovely day, tomorrow: burma, 15: home fires: britain 1940-1941 16: inside the reich: germany, 1940-1944 17: morning: june - august 1944 18: occupation holland, 1940-1944 19: pincers: august 1944- march 1945 20: genocide: 1941-1945 21: nemesis, germany: february-may 1945 22: japan: 1941-1945 23: pacific: february 1942-july 1945 24: the bomb: february-september 1945 25: reckoning

this is what we can do to each other. this is the sort that everbody should see at least once.it does not glorify world. it shows that it is the everyday person who is killed, mained and debased by war. the person on the "other side" eats sleeps, laughs and cry just as we do.

war is hell. but this documentary of wwii is heaven.not only is this series a breath-taking, almost-exhaustive look at the second world war, it's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence olivier.this documentary series defines the genre. it's sweepingly long, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more. (i have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a year).truly, this is an impeccable bit of film-making. other than olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories; whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper.i'm going to go watch it right now (again, my... 11th time).

i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s.i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it.it became a weekly ritual every sunday, and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special.the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document.so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each.some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic.while the battle of stalingrad had one episode to itself.this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead.the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time.anthony eden the foreign secretary,carl donnitz,head of the u-boats,albert speer,pet architect confident and later armament minister for hitler.in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge, hitler's secretary,who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament-she left the bunker after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines.these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed.if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code-breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers.the opening titles and music are magnificent,and lawrence olivier's narration lends a natural gravity to the script.the best documentary series ever made? without doubt.unmissable

still the definitive program about the second world war, the world at war isn't just long, but also very informative. the series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. most episodes are about the war in europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific. other episodes include information about the wars in africa, burma, the atlantic and the home fronts of germany, great britain, united states and soviet union. there is one episode that's dedicated to the holocaust. the series starts off with the episode a new germany (1933-1939), and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. the series ends with the episode remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. each episode is like a mini-film. the footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. in addition, some of the footage is in color. the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining.the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television (uk). commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. the series was narrated by laurence olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them albert speer, karl donitz, jimmy stewart, bill mauldin, curtis lemay, lord mountbatten, alger hiss, toshikazu kase, arthur harris, charles sweeney, paul tibbets, traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose. jeremy isaacs says in "the making of the world at war" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to isaacs, was heinrich himmler's adjutant, karl wolff. the latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in himmler's presence.the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war. some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. in a list of the 100 greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, the world at war ranked 19th. the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. i've seen some of them several times. there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer. one is called the great war (1964) that's about world war i. the other is called cold war (1998) that's about the cold war obviously.

world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time. the historical research is virtually flawless. even after a quarter century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about ww2. an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war. i highly recommend it as a learning experience.

i am not a very good writer, so i'll keep this short. world at war is the best wwii documentary that i've seen. i've seen different wwii documentaries (not only english/north american) and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i've seen. i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why/how hitler got to power, but it does a very good job at covering the war. it seems to be complete and objective/fair to everyone. it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations. it has a lot of original footage, including color footage and many eye witnesses (it was made in 70's when a lot more were alive). it has great music and narrator. all-in-all i gave this one 10/10, because it's that good. (i haven't seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those)

i remember watching this as a child in the uk, mesmerized by the story and laurence olivier's narration. we would talk about nothing else at school the next day. i imagine the ratings for the first showing were huge. this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much. what is interesting is that the battles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely unrecognized as such by americans. the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american generals, the suffering of german troops on the eastern front, the maltreatment of japanese prisoners of war by american troops. the images of the holocaust made me, a non-jewish european, feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people. i don't know why this is not number one in the imdb rankings. perhaps they are showing their bias against documentaries. spoiler - we win.

this is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of world war 2 from the invasion of poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945.honest and to the point, this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war. at the same time tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked, much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high, low and turning points in the allies fortunes. being a british produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on britain, but russia and america's contribution are not skimmed over this is but one such advantage of a series of such length.another worthy mention is the score, the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil, struggle and perseverance. like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the germans during the war, its build to a climax at the end of every episode, which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war. after watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation.

10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must see, with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years, untill this was screened in 1974. the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. the whole series is over 20 episodes long, and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still, and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch. you must watch this at some time, even if it's a few episodes, even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war, in a world at war..

example of how a world war 2 documentary should be made,using first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful conflict,and archived footage gathered from around the time .i caught this on a re-run on the history channel about a year and a half back,with no knowledge really of the second world war at the time,but it enveloped me,and now i consider myself a world war 2 buff,watching and reading any and all that i can find about it,but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary,definitely worth buying the boxed set of.............this is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard.

i must have seen this a dozen times over the years. i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b & w on the local pbs station.i bought a dvd set for the children to see, and am making them watch it. they don't teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. it expands their critical thinking.impartially, with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what lead up to the war and the actual war.buy it for your children, along with alistair cooke's america. watch it with them, and make them understand. you'll be so glad you did.

this should be required viewing for all young people. this is documentary at its best, from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses, the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanity's sorry experience at the nadir of the 20th century.

after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making. the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project. it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian(ken burns ?) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original. if you are interested in this era don't miss this series. it is required viewing.

certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison. the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation. no one country is given undue credit for the allied victory. laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator.

if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives, this dvd delivers, you will learn new things guaranteed, so much so that you won't need any other documentary's on the subject. get this, watch it, learn from it. good for school use as well. as a bonus, watch this with tora tora tora, saving private ryan, patton, band of brothers, a bridge too far, the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete. sir laurence oliver's voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26 part series. seriously you won't find a better wwii documentary set on the subject. perfect 10!!!

although too young to remember the first showing of the series (being just a baby) i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's, just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects. it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific. since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era, with mixed opinions. the british television stations are generally very good at producing these, as the world at war can easily attest, with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies. i strongly recommend such titles as "the nazis - a warning from history", "blitz" and the bbc series about dunkirk. "britain at war in colour", with its companion series "japan", "germany" and "america" are of a very high standard. the world at war is by far the best and, despite its age, never fails to deliver. there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other, even if such an undertaking was even possible. what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable. that certainly worked for me: i now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, dvds and tapes and cds. recommend to anyone with even a passing interest. the series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative.

the music and laurence olivier's sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary. this is still a must see for ww ii buffs, descendants of the participants of that conflict, politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier (did you hear that george bush?) and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict. the 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained. there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented. actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories. many of the interviews are with second line authorities, that is, support personnel to the main characters, privates, captains, secretaries, eyewitnesses and the like. you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about.i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary. i strongly recommend this over the worn out, gaptoothed, overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay. i paid $120 cdn for five 2-sided dvd discs. this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode. the menus are easy to follow, there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode. it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years, nay, after 60 years since the war finished.i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy. now my wish has finally come true.see this documentary. tell your friends. buy a copy for your library. remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america, russia, britain, canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory. what an eye opener.

my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times. i can't imagine how it could be better. this isn't the "complete" history of wwiino library could hold such a historybut it is the best summary of that history. lots of detail, lots of personal stories, and still keeps the overall picture in view.olivier's narration is excellently written and, of course, superbly given. the interviews are from all sides, except the russian, because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians. it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd. we treasure our copy.the producer's do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive: there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles, for instance, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done.

theo robertson has commented that waw didn't adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitler's rise and wwii.perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8? covers this period, and together with the earlier volumes in the series, shows clearly the existing conditions, i feel. a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period, joined the hitler youth even, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in waw.this documentary is so far above the history channel's documentaries i also own, that there is no comparison.the only fault, and it is a small one, that i have with waw is this: the numbers are not included, many times. for instance, if you're talking about lend-lease, then how much war material was lent/leased? how much to russia, how much to britian? how many merchant ships did the u-boats sink, and when? how many ships did the german or japanese navy have, total, in 1941? what type were they? how many troops? how many troops did the allies have, in total, and by country? lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off, but i would have preferred more! and naturally, i always want to see more military analysis. like why didn't patton & clark trap the german army that was at cassini, after they had it surrounded, instead of racing monty to rome, and letting it escape? i don't think you can begin to understand war until you've seen some of these video segments on "total war", like the fire bombing of dresden. it's like trying to understand auschwitz, etc., before you see the clips of the death camps: you just can't wrap your head around it - it's too unbelievable.unknown at that time, and of course, unfilmed, were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese, including cannibalism, (read "flyboys"), and some live vivisection of medical "experimentation" prisoners, w/o any anesthetic! dave

utterly brilliant. powerful and evocative. the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war. it's tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits. rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war, it allows sir laurence olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocents. most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of "civility" are removed. there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on. perhaps there could be a follow up series called "the century at war" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this.

this series, produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second world war, is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual's presumption to criticize.the timing of world at war's production in 1974, amounting to some three decades after the events of the war, permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant. the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did.the information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact. such names as ira eaker, adolph galland, louis mountbatten, albert speer, gertrude junge (hitler's personal secretary)... the list is far too long to relate. today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to ww2. the dvd series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price.i am almost done watching the 11 disk set, having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than 10 years ago. it has lost none of its poignancy to me, indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times.the highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation. i think the value of this series is beyond counting.

hello. i just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. i am a history teacher that has wayyyyy too much time on my hands. i need a life. i found the movie containing a striking resemblance to broke back mountain. i also found that i look a lot like jean lafitte if he were white. also, my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr. petey--"this baby can shoot a chipmunk's eye from 300 yards!!" oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the british were coming in, and the one drummer who was so devoted to his work, and he drummed till the death, as if that drum would end the war altogether....but it wouldn't. well, thats all i would like to say about this movie. oh, one more thing..bonnie brown is an insane physco bipolar mood swinging beeyotch. that is all.

i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of it.i t is not a mindless movie like ....."leathal weapon part 58" you know the one where riggs is really crazy? it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning. you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way.i have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because .....duh they don't get it or understand it or what happened.don't let your doggy take a shower!!!

of the films of the young republic few in number as they are the buccaneer (1958)stands out as a finely crafted film. charleton heston excels in his portrayal of old hickory's defence of new orleans with a thrown together force of militia, regulars and pirates promised a reprieve.after christmas 1814 peninsula veterans led by sir edward packenham, the duke of wellington's brother in law bore down on the city of new orleans. andy jackson had a day to draw together a scratch force to defend the city behind bales of hay.charlton heston projects jackson's terrifying presence and awe inspiring power of command. yet there are a few colorful comic relief. with the might of the english lioness about to pounce, a young blond haired voluteer from new orleans asks: i guess the ruckus is about to start.the battle was about to rage but not for long. true to form the british marched straight into withering american fire. in less than a few minutes an attempt to reconquer lost north american territories had been foiled.the battle scene in this movies lasts slightly longer than the actual battle itself.there are colorful side stories in this film of the young volunteer at his first dance to celebrate the victory.

this movie has great stars in their earlier years: ingor stevens never looked prettier; yul brynner was a very convincing jean lafitte, conflicted about his piracy and desiring to keep neutrality with the united states. charlton heston did a pretty good job as andrew jackson, but some moments were a bit stilted. it's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history, and it shows that all happy endings do not include the lovers getting together with each other--sometimes the happier ending is that they sail away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run. i have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and though it is not the best movie i've ever seen, i love it every time!

the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march. a very good film indeed. hollywood's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner. he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies. charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius. however, the movie did tend to get a little long in places. it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version. still, it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once.

taken in the context of the time it was made, i found this a worthwhile movie. while the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer. in addition, i found spotting actors i knew a real pleasure. who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad? i'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. as to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to andrew jackson's right hand man peavey. the perfect touch of comedy. well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of america, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.

during the whole pirates of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b. demille supervised movie and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extras included. it is obvious to me that paramount pictures execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans, louisiana which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous for it's pirate connections. when the execs at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper. paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !

sure, the history in this movie was "hollywoodized"--but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses. lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british, not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused his sailing to galveston; he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero *or* a swashbuckler. but who cares? this is one movie that's sheer entertainment--and face it, we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor. brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance.

if you're at all interested in pirates, pirate movies, new orleans/early 19th century american history, or yul brynner, see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it. don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews. my reaction to it was that it is entertaining, well acted (for the most part), has some very witty dialogue, and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte. while not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans' history, and the love-hate relationship between the "respectable" citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. don't worry about what the film doesn't do, but watch it for what it does do, i.e., for its study of one of new orleans', and america's, most intriguing historical figures.

this interesting feature has a very fine story-line, rather colorful characters and a very steady pace. it also incorporates a plot device from "reap the wild wind", and since cecil b. deille directed that and his son-in-law anbthony quinn directed this film from his preparations, that can hardly be a coincidence. it works in both cases, i must report. the unusual set-up tells the viewer that barataria, an island ruled by jean lafitte is built upon piracy, but during the war of 1812, and before, he has always refrained from bothering united states' vessels. now general andrew jackson has been charged with defending nearby new orleans with only 12,000 men against 60,000 british imperial redcoats and 60 ships. lafitte's men want him to side with the stronger force; he wants freedom and pardons for his men before ceding such a strategic landing spot to the u.s. forces. there are other factors at work in the story-line; pirate bonnie brown and her father want to attack u.s. ships and do so in defiance of lafitte's orders, leaving a boy alive without knowing they have missed an eyewitness. when his testimony finally comes out, jackson cannot grant what lafitte asks; but lafitte supports him anyway and in the fog, the pirates and jackson rout the british and he sails away to whatever destiny awaits a man who had genius and statesmanship but not fortune. the cast of this colorful and physically-lovely film are skilled indeed. yul brynner has one of his best roles as the pirate king, inger stevens is beautiful; as the girl he loves, charles boyer has many good lines as his adviser, powerful lorne greene is a rival, e.g. marshall the governor, and claire bloom is charismatic as bonnie brown. others in the cast include ted de corsia, douglass dumbrille, george mathews, henry hull as jackson's adviser, bruce gordon, onslow stevens, robert f. simon, henry brandon, fran jeffries, and leslie bradley, among others. the music by elmer bernstein is very memorable, and the 1938 script remade here had only to be freshened a bit. the shiny cinematography was the work of veteran loyal griggs, the set decoration was supplied by albert nozaki, hal pereira and walter tyler, with set decoration by sam comer and roy moyer and costumes by edith head, john jensen and ralph jester. nellie manley did the elaborate hairstyles and wally westmore the difficult makeup. the film contains quite a bit of good adventure-level dialogue and a very strong climactic battle scene. charlton heston, as as andrew jackson, prepared to play the part of an elder general and then discovered the man was young at the time of the battle; but he is often effective, grey-haired or not, especially in his exchanges with henry hull as mr. peavey. this is an exciting and well-mounted entertainment, which looks exactly as if c.b. demille had completed his production; it is a beautiful and nearly a very-fine motion picture.

i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60's. it's a typical hollywood history epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what, it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film. cecil b. demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. his son-in-law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again. demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer/actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project. also from the 10 commandments are screenwriter jesse lasky, cinematographer loyalk griggs, assistant director francisco day, 2nd unit director arthur rosson, art directors walter tyler and hal pereira, set directors sam comer and ray moyer, costume designers edith head, john jensen and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the buccaneer's only oscar nomination. a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson. also in the cast are charles boyer, e.g. marshall, lorne greene, claire bloom and inger stevens. at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes. i would give it a 7.5 out of 10.

the documentary begins with setting the perspective to several light years. the voyager is traveling our milky-way with the sounds of our earthly lives, as a space monument for (possible?) extraterrestrials. the documentary contains footage of willy dixen, robert johnson, skip james and j.b. lenoir. the footage of j.b. has never been published before. the narrative is from 'blind willie' dixon. however, it's done by an actor. the film shows the work of all these early blues men followed by covers and interpretations by musicians, such as nick cave and the bad seeds among others. the death of j.b. lenoir (john mayall's song) is a striking event in the story. lenoir got political engaged and is considered to be of the league of martin luther king and peers. his political interests can be found in the themes of his lyrics. blues is found to be 'the' native music of america. blues is the roots and the rest is the fruits.the title 'soul of a man' is after a willie dixon song.

i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival.i absolutely was into it. i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes. it is amazing set-design. the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies.and the music is so nice.i rate this experience 9/10.* spoilers ahead *the documentary tells about awesome blues-men, with black-and-white old-looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. it is really amazing. but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary. it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those blues songs in a modern way. i didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs. this is the same kind of un-perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club.the documentary was such a standing-ovation at this first screening in the little cinema, that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open-air cinema. though the sand, the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night.

mahatma gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for india's freedom struggle ignored his own family and son, this movie is about his son hiralal who feels neglected because of mahatma gandhi's service to the society. the movie starts off in south africa where mahatma gandhi works as a barrister and fighting the cause of india's freedom against the british. hirarala arrives in south africa to help his dad who is a barrister, since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams, he gets married to his love gulab (bhoomika chawla) against his father's wishes. hiralal has ambitions to travel to england and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony. this angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt, he loses his wife and children. akshaye khanna has give a stellar performance as hiralal gandhi.. all kudos to him, the direction and the script is fantastic, the picturization is excellent. overall an excellent movie and a must see. i give it a 10/10

gandhi my father is like viewing a book, chapter by chapter you read it(with your eyes) and you learn more about harilal gandhi and for that matter kasturba gandhi. so little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely. the title misleads though, its as much a movie about mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son, as its about harilal and his mother. and akshaye khanna and shefali chayya do full justice to their respective roles.such movies are like leap years. they come after only so much time.gandhi my father, is also about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever undertaken.watch it, if you like quality cinema.

i just came back from the late-night cinema and it was indeed a silent way out as most of the audience pondered though the real-life black & white images of the partition,the freedom movement,etc which was very much reminiscent of the lives' our forefathers faced! amidst this backdrop,mind you,there was no tel/fax/internet in those times but for the very voice of truth & non-violence, the cinematography infused some spirit of stark reality of adversity amidst the strict raj.gandhi shown as a hardworking attorney in south africa,who stood for his basic ideologies and gave every degree of conviction to spread awareness of the same with humility and sainthood which to the uttered speech of general smut was shown as a nice farewell on screen.it had the best drafted speech with a subtle humour & a veiled threat to the british raj in india!there was a nice remark when he said we pray in silence to the british in india now that gandhi,the politician is set for india(towards sainthood).the very backdrop of a big family with many kids needs the mention of an obvious divided attention and love which had to cast it's spell on the unfortunate kid's psyche who was left alone to aspire for unrealistic ambitions.little did harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father.he tries to do away from mentor-ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate neighbours in the streets of gandhi's residence when harilal vents out his frustration in open.this means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversions and alcoholism ,with debt and dis-obedience fuelling his negative thoughts.he still had shown the sincere love for his mother through touchy scenes and even gandhi's humble expressions form harilal to forgive him didn't meet any conclusions in his mind as he always feared the father,gandhi.he couldn't digest the fact that gandhi couldn't share his love with him as he expected & was driven to rebellion when he couldn't understand the equal-merit based delivery of scholarship money by his father to his cousin where he saw a failed opportunity to study for barrister in england.this had to take it's toll in him thrown to the streets as a beggar when the whole of india was celebrating the indepedence!the life of a destitute never changes come what may but the manner in which the sad death of kasturba & gandhi himself is shown brings in an emotional silence.finally the last turbulent thoughts of the dying harilal is shown as a flashback to keep the audience gripping and wondering where did the father of the nation go wrong? was he clever enough to be mentally strong to lead an-one man army & use his brave soldier-son as a weapon to show to the british & rival forces that when it comes to the interest of the nation,nothing comes in between.sadly though that to read a mahatma's heart one has to live outside his family and see which the emotionally naive harilal couldn't see living inside....a pity that such naive harilal's are still ruining the efforts of many mahatma-like fathers in many families in todays' life and have taken to drugs,alcoholism and god knows what thoughts!!here's a message to all those brave sainik(soldier)-sons please respect the father of the nation!please obey and happiness shall be bestowed or else it's a disaster in waiting,isn't it?

it was easy for sir richard attenborough to make gandhi (1982)he was merely narrating a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago. comparatively, it must have been a lot tougher for director feroz abbas khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make gandhi my father, pitting a shriveled anti-hero against an international hero, both of whom were historically real individuals, and ironically father and son. the events in the film are mostly real. mahatma gandhi lived as shown in the film, setting high moral standards for the world to follow. yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his eldest son harilal to be a lawyer of repute like his father, to complete his education and get a job in india and thus provide income for his nuclear family.the film does not debunk gandhi and his ideals. for gandhi, his mission was larger than his family's aspirations. he loved his family and cared for them, though his thoughts for their appeasement were blinkered by his ideal of caring for the masses. he stood for equality and dignity among all persons and in his view to give special undue advantages to his own son overlooking other deserving persons went against the basis of what he preached. the film looks at an unusual case of parentingwhere an idealist parent places receding goalposts for a less-than-brilliant offspring. the film presents an unusual scenario that happened. a son marries his childhood sweetheart, upsetting his father. the father upsets his son's educational aspirations at several key junctures. the fragile link between a devoted son and a father breaks, as the son wants to stand on his own feet and care for his nuclear family. while the father gradually becomes the father of a nation, the son stumbles in valiant quest for identity and survival. his marriage breaks and seeks solace in religion, buffeting between islam and hinduism. through all his tribulations his link to his mother remains, until she chides him for being drunk.feroz khan is essentially a director of plays making his foray into cinema. he wrote and directed the play mahatma vs. gandhi that had considerable impact on the indian theater community. the play and the consequent film were based on two biographies, one by chandulal dalal and another by nilamben parekh, the success of the staged play was an evident reason for the commercial bollywood actor anil kapoor to produce this noteworthy film. every time a good director of plays attempts to direct cinema there is an evidence of a lack of confidence with the medium. peter brook is a great director of plays, but less competent as a film director. the opening shots of khan's film promises great cinemaa derelict harilal gandhi is brought to sion hospital, bombay (mumbai) barely mumbling that his father is bapu (the popular name of mahatma gandhi), father to an entire nation. the hospital authorities do not recognize him to be mahatma gandhi's eldest son, dying in poverty and loneliness. apart from the dramatic opening, the film unfortunately merely presents a great story and some superb exterior shots of father and son meditating in silhouette. for an indian film it does present some high production qualities that go hand in hand with a lack of interest for details (the clothes of most indians in the film seem dust-free and freshly laundered, modern hairstyles of actors, and even shefali shetty playing mohandas gandhi's wife a century ago with plucked eyebrows), the bane of indian cinema. since feroz khan is a theater personality, he has invested much more effort in working with the actors in developing the characters rather than on cinematic details, somewhat like sir attenborough another person who is also a product of theater (royal academy of dramatic arts).knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble, even when there was no direct criticism in the film, producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india, fearing that some one could tear the poster or disrespect it intentionally or unintentionally. with all its mix of greatness and faults, gandhi, my father throws several questions at the viewer. is a mother-son bonding stronger than a father-son bonding in parenting? is one's immediate family less important than humanity at large? does one seek refuge in religion and alcohol only when worldly troubles are encountered? in this film, harilal buffeted by adversities runs from one religion to another, while his father quotes scriptures "forgive them for they know not what they do" when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman, convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well.the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for shefali shetty (shah) and an indian award from critics. feroze khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above-average performances from the ensemble of actors. i do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play girish karnad's tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards.

i would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the flaws as i am not a professional film critic and i do not have enough knowledge of making movies. what i do know is that making this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a big achievement and i would like to congratulate the director for that. however, in some reviews, that i have read, critics have complained that hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted, and his siblings were completely erased from the story. now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests, it is not a movie about hiralal's brothers, it is a movie on the relationship of mahatma gandhi and his son hiralal gandhi, nothing more nothing less. if we start complaining about some characters being kept out of action in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters don't fit in the picture, no matter how relevant they were in real life. so i think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselves.enjoy!!!!

gandhi, the great :greatness in the world is associated with people like alexanader the great, ashoka the great for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans. gandhi is called great for actually not being a great but being more human, for i always believe bringing out the humanity in us is where the greatness of being human lies.gandhi was a human with humanity and one who strived for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies. let me move to the movie review now.about gandhi my father :gandhi my father is a film not about gandhi but about his son harilal gandhi.on telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth, the director succeeds in portraying the tale.the film succeeds in telling the story of a mislead son of a father who lead a nation to greatness.the movie is termed as a criticism of gandhi's failure as a father to his son, i would rather say it is of a sacrifice gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as a father of a nation.i wish the essence of this movie prevails not just in india, the gandhian land, but through the hearts of all the people of this world.gandhi the true human. jaihind.

i saw the movie and really could not stop my tears. its tragedy that india has no such leaders after freedom, who dare to do justice with their own children, when they don't behave properly.. in current generation, politicians bring their children's into politics without measuring their caliber and skills.. i remember the dialogue from gandhi 'what kind of society we want to create/make with such people (about harilal)?' no wonder that it will be a dream that india will hardly have such leader in this or next generation.. einstein was right when he said about gandhi that 'after 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body, soul and mind (mahatma gandhi) had ever lived on this earth.' i sincerely want to thanks a lot to anil kapoor, feroze khan and all film actors/actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son. all father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.

keeping all political views aside, feroz khan and anil kapoor's 'gandhi, my father' is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused-towards-family side of mohandas karamchand gandhi, and the fight of his eldest son harilal gandhi with the society, his larger-than-life father, and most importantly demons in his head. one draws parallels to gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their fatherthe acting is good. shefali shetty, darshan zariwala and akshaye khanna-strictly in that order- add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of harilal who weeps to be hugged just once and also runs away at the faintest touch of the finger.feroz khan's direction and the production canvas is lavish and attractive, however, the screenplay could've been tighter. i had seen the play some years ago on a pirated video type dvd (it was called mahatama vs gandhi, i think) and it was certainly more gripping. though, the movie's background score and the father-son and mother-son moments are just a brilliant treat.this movie could have been great. it's borderline to that. it has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions, nothing comes to you.it compares decently to other gandhi's. certainly not an overview film like kingsley's gandhi,or abstract as kamal hassan's hey ram. the film just about manages to find its footing; however, one is left wondering "what if..." worth a watch. 7.5/10

the movie took a new angle to gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was. his relationship with harilal is something that gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.my big gripe is that i thought gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. it could have been better acted by the person who played gandhi. some of gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.the movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. the rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.

it is one of the better indian movies i have seen lately, instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies. all the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing. it is the hallmark of a good movie, that it make the viewer go back and research the subject, which exactly what i did checking on harilal. i always enjoy akshay khanna's subtle style of acting and interestingly he had rather a complicated relationship with his own father vinod khanna, albeit not as dramatic as gandhis and wonder how it helped him essay this character. i was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for anil kapoor for producing such a classy movie.

this movie is simply awesome.it was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb.this movie did not create any controversy in india (as far as i know) and its publicity was also kept low.initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing...most of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember ashoka, mangal pandey,loc etc..there have been so many movies in india which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added.but its treatment is pretty similar to pinjar movie (also a must watch).if it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor ( producer ) and firoz abbas khan ( the director) for making such a great movie..

feroz abbas khan's gandhi my father, a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the mahatma and his son harilal gandhi. for a story that's as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell, it's a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically. gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school. now the film aims to convey one very interesting point - the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person, ended up being an unfair father. this point is made in the film many times over, and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to england, which gandhi twice denies his son. instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head, the director just moves along with the story, thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment harilal feels towards his father. which is why when we finally see an outburst from harilal, it comes off looking like he's over-reacting. the point i'm trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did. we never really understand why he turned to islam, and then back again to hinduism. the thing is, we never really understand harilal at all. and that's because the director of this film is too busy focusing on mohandas karamchand gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle, a story most of us are already familiar with. to put it simply, gandhi my father promises to examine the strained father-son relationship, but it doesn't so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in. we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being gandhi's son, but show us why that was a burden to begin with. show us incidents of their early conflict. for example, it's not enough that gandhi merely says he's opposed to harilal's early marriage, tell us why this opposition? it's not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out - for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa, for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate. words are not enough, show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi.what's more, instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship, the film goes off on too many tangents, thus diluting the impact of the central theme. this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence, and yet on many occasions that's exactly what it seems like, because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment, even though much of it has no relevance to the film's basic premise - the stormy father-son relationship. so you see the problem with this film is not that it's a bad film, but it's certainly a very confused film. what happens to harilal's children after his wife's death? does he ever have relationship with them? where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba? none of these questions are answered in a film that's basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family. the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself, gandhi my father is a disappointment, no questions asked.cinematically, it struggles to translate the filmmaker's ambitious intention to the screen. practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fade-ins and fade-outs, never quite seamlessly leading into each other. on the positive side, there is inherent nobility in the film, which you recognise. the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative, trying hard not to take sides, never once judging either father or son, painting neither as the villain. what the film does do, however, is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation, but evidently alienated his family. of all the actors in the film it's only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luck-deprived harilal gandhi. it's a wonderful performance, and it's not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character. but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure. just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife's dead, and you'll realise how much he conveys through body language alone. darshan jariwala, meanwhile, who plays gandhi senior, adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years, but it's the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actor's best contribution to that role. the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba, the woman who's meant to be torn in this father-son conflict, but if she's unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then it's really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script. much effort's gone into the making of this film and that's evident throughout, but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you'll remember about it when you leave the cinema - it's just so boring.director feroz abbas khan's gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes, but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay. what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy. and with this film, the director makes us too.

mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie. don't get me wrong i am not condemning the movie; it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat. we need to understand mahatma's spiritual standing, he is a true spiritual leader. only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones. a man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example. according to the movie, he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from, but poor harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. when things went wrong with harilall, mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy. had it been any other parents, they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet. mahatma didn't do that, he is true leader who leads by example.

it takes guts to make a movie on gandhi in india ,in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.this movie shows how a mahatma failed to be a decent father(at least in the eyes of his son). the performances are terrific ,the cinematography fantastic, the direction fabulous,but the film drags.if the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectations,which i assume is the case here,then its a brilliant attempt,but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success,then the film's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject..20 yrs from now,this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of harilal by akshaye khanna.he deserves an oscar nomination for this one..and honestly,his is not the only performance worth applauding, shefali chhaya is terrific too..watch the scene where harilal hears about his father's death.no dialogues,no screaming,but a speechless shot by khanna.its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of cinemagandhi,my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes,its excellent cinema and a must watch.brilliant attempt..

"gandhi as a husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in india. 'gandhi...my father' is a story that only a few would have known to such details. surely an insight into gandhi's personal life.overall, i liked the movie for story and cinematography. jariwala, akshay khanna, and shefali shah have all done a good job. most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers...commendable job. traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happenings.however, what i didn't quite like was the narration style. at several points, i found the tone over-dramatized.overall, good work by anil kapoor productions. i would recommend it as "must-watch-once". 8/10

from very long, we are seeing movies on gandhi. and mostly, the light is always on portrayal of gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles. but when i heard that a movie is being made which will highlight gandhi as father and stress on his relationship with his son, it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it. fortunetly, anil kapoor (producer) and feroz abbad khan (director) did.the story start with gandhi working in south africa and his relationship with white people and his wife. latter akshay (harilal) joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father (gandhi) pushed (or motivate) him to become freedom fighter. it showcase that gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education. harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife, children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father. he finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms. he written back to india but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time. i am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story...performance. first akshay. he has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as harilal gandhi. the scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden/developing in akshay. darshan jariwala is also good as mk gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character. he performed well and with quite an ease. shefali chaya (now shah) as kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in tv serials. bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role. other actor have also justifies their performances.technique and make up is also good and cinematography especially that duo tone color picturisation was too good. costume looks and match with context.overall, a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date. also, the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me, it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end.

gandhi my father is a well made movie. it nicely portrays the life of gandhiji's eldest son harilal. his character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failure, his ego.. akshaye khanna completely justifies the role of harilal. just not him, everyone did well in the roles they played. darshan jariwala is the best on-screen gandhiji i've ever seen. but i will cut three points as there were few shortcomings.first, movie was fifteen-twenty minutes longer than it should have. second, the movie needed more research into harilal's character. somewhere, the character looked incomplete. also, his relation with his brothers was not shown. there was no mention of any other child of gandhiji in the whole movie. i believe the character like harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well, considering the egoist nature of harilal.anyways, despite some shortcomings, i liked the movie. recommended...

this movie is about a dysfunctinal family but not just any dysfunctional family. it is about the family of the father of our nation (india) although, the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between mahatma gandhi and his eldest son harilal gandhi. it shows how the mahatma had to kill m.k. gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom. every time mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son would try to get close the mahatma would come between them. this is a beautifully done film. akshaye khanna has proved himself to be a top actor. he expressed emotions very naturally. darshan jariwala who mainly stars in plays-gurukant desai's lawyer in guru has portrayed gandhi wonderfully.(as a real human being, unlike ben kingsley who made him look like a god) shefali shah the girl from monsoon wedding has also done a really good job of showing how kasturba gandhi was torn between father and son. this movie is touching and so is its soundtrack "raghupati raghava" sung in a very unique manner. i saw this movie just 3 hours ago(it released in dubai a day earlier-on the 2nd) and when the movie was over there was "pin drop silence" and while exiting out of the theatre not one person pushed another( can you imagine us indians not pushing ?) not one ! there was a sacred silence...

this documentary was very thorough and exposing, and at the same time entertaining, which i thought was rather impressive. i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its' origin until present day, but nonetheless, there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film...i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the 'proper nouns' of the sport, so to speak: too much on individual locations at which to surf, and especially too much on individual surfers. i felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc. it would have been better (although this of course was covered, i do not think it got as much time as it warranted). and for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing, at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring. although the video clips and the in-depth research is well-respected, it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers.furthermore, my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding, and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing, breath-taking event that these men are talking about as life-changing moments, and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it, and not the actual footage. it was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories, and then be unable to see them. i understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything, but please: do not brag an event up so much, and then not show it. overall, a very fresh documentary that i enjoyed watching; not the best documentary due to the above reasons, but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that i would advise everybody to check out.

i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now. i must really love it, right? well, not really.i was a surfer earlier in my life, and i loved the sport. to this day, i am fascinated by good surfing. riding giants has plenty of that, and thus i am a sucker for the thing. but i definitely have some bones to pick with it. (peralta, you listening?).first, the movie has too little faith in its subject matter. the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined. very, very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish. peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic, cut-and-pace method. it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot mavericks in northern california. not a single wave is ridden start to finish. almost the entire section on mavericks (one third of the movie) is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack. i can understand the effect peralta was trying to achieve with mavericks, as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop, but he goes way too far. mavericks is not just a bad acid trip. waves are actually ridden there, even with great performances. it would have been good to see some of them. if peralta thinks this is a grand sport (and i am sure he does), then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much? at times, the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable. there is one fast clip in the section on peahi in hawaii, which i still cannot understand. even if i run it on slow motion on dvd, the image is too fast to be decipherable. it must be a couple of frames in length at the max.second, have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement? it is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors' version on dvd. these guys sound like two over-the-top valley girls. the same sentiment shows up in the main production. every thing is always so goddamn "amazing" etc. one character in particular is just plain obnoxious -- sam george, the editor of surfer magazine, who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say. he is a super drag on the movie.there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie. i mean, just to get the old movie shots they have, and also, all of the interviews. the movie is a great story, and i think it is generally captivating entertainment. thematically it is well laid out, with the three parts centering around greg noll, jeff clark, and laird hamilton respectively. there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal. in the directors' narration, they say it is a new type of 3d technology, and it really works. the three principle characters shine, both in their interviews and in the water. as an athlete, laird hamilton is a revelation. he rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball. and too, the story of his meeting his father is a gem. it really touched me.it is just that the movie could have been so much more. the very last part of the movie, when the credits roll, gives a hint of what it could have been. there are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack. (the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish, though you may like it if you are fan of the modern, frenetic school of rock.) anyway there's my two cents...

i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. it is filled with super-surfer greg noll's home movies, and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. nevertheless, it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. it is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or ph.d's(again, perhaps). it believes in the quest of the surfer. it believes in the beauty of human goofiness. it believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before. it celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the russian socialists. surfing is the ultimate narcissism. it is dangerous, but only slightly historical. i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. this movie has no military heroes. it has no guns. the only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. this is not a problem. peace is not desperate. it is the joy of exhalation.

riding giantsthis documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and acclaimed surfer films, dana brown's endless summer, its follow-up endless summer ii by bruce brown, dana's son, and step into liquid (imax). i saw the first, not the others. while the surfing footage is spectacular, i valued most the film-maker's historic perspective. he takes us back to the sport's origins almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it evolved to its present form. this includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs changed over time, which beaches in hawaii and california were most frequented by the world-class surfers, and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them. the athletes lived for months at a time on beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary bunks, fished for food, and went back out on their boards the next day. what a euphoric way to spend your youthful days. we see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. what was the biggest boost to the sport? believe it or not, it was the movie gidget, although i suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the beachboys' surfing songs like surfer girl and surfing usa. the surfing magazine and encyclopedia of surfing (who knew there was such a tome) are mentioned for their contributions. we also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport, their families, and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s. one such story is how 40-year old laird hamilton, considered today's greatest surfer, bonded with an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his single mom, who he married before becoming his step-dad. a rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. have i whetted your appetite? wonderful. have a great ride.

if it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport--no, the pure lifestyle--of surfing to its perfect form, this documentary has done it. this documentary shows the life isn't just about the waves, but it's more about the people, the pioneers, and the modern day vanguard that are pushing the envelope of big wave further than it's ever been.stacy peralta--a virtual legend from my early '80s skateboarding days as a socal teen--has edited reams of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence and created what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. when his heart and soul is in the subject matter--and clearly it is here--his genius is fraught with a pure vision that doesn't glamorize, hype, or sentimentalize his subject. he reveres surfers and the surfing/beach lifestyle, but doesn't whitewash it either. there is a gritty reality to the sport as well.there is so much that could be said about this documentary, about the surfers, the early history of the sport, and the wild big wave surfers it profiles. greg noll, the first big wave personality who arguably pioneered the sport; jeff carter, an amazing guy who rode virtually alone for 15 years on northern california's extremely dangerous maverick's big surf; and, the centerpiece of the documentary, laird hamliton, big wave surfing's present day messiah.there is tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys--and a few girls who show up on camera--and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that comes through in every word. i found the story of how hamilton's adopted father met him and how hamilton as a small 4- or 5-year old boy practically forced him to be his dad especially heartwarming (and, again, stripped of syrupy sentimentality).if you like surfing--or even if you don't--this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched, if only because you're a student of the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly well-done works of art.

everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great), the personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture through time). what is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance: chucking mainstream american culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.i was a surfer in the 1970s. we used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in socal. i remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, putting on a hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night. often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script off sheets of paper. sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. i was never happier. except for the hooting and hollering, seeing 'riding giants' took me back in time.it also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge, not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder, not keeping up with the joneses, pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question, "what is the purpose of life?" at least for those like greg noll, laird hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: to live life solely on our own terms. maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.it was this message that really impressed me.

riding giants is an amazing movie. it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf. their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. they didn't care about money, jobs, girls or any thing. to them the waves were their girls. i have never been on a surf board, and it looks so hard, i don't understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie. if you're a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came into life, who is really famous at it or what ever, then you should really see it. it might be a documentary, but it is really good. -tara f.-

as a popular sport, surfing was liked by many people. just after watched the documentary, i realized how dangerous it could be. in fact the surfers also scared of big waves. even somebody got killed by it. but they still kept on surfing and enjoyed themselves. only brave people can do it.according to what the surfers said, we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came at them. you have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave. when you win it, that will obviously bring you huge satisfaction.the amazing cinematography cannot be overlooked. that is absolutely visual enjoyment.an excellent sports documentary. 8/10

noll's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments, often with expletives, to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing. there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues, using more language than necessary. this guy should never have been given a thesaurus. cut to noll and you know you're in for a treat!the way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a "lost era". nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less took care of issues like medical care. the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done.

again stacy peralta is true first to the people who lived the story. by letting those involved in the genesis of big wave surfing tell us their stories, how it felt and what they thought, you get the feeling of having been there. the film carries you from the fifties to the near present by focusing on three primary architects contributing to the evolution and development of the sport. candid "home movie" like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world. the layers of music, culture, technical information,a pure view of the participant's athleticism, and fabulous big wave images you get a full scope perspective of this aspect of surfing.thoroughly worth watching.

i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title. this movie is not primarily about the act of "riding giants," but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, riding giants, to change the emphasis.in my teens i lived a block from the wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. i've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. the idea that jeff clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding maverick's by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp. the first safety rule of any water sport is "never surf/dive/swim by yourself." he went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it. i wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left. in the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body. these are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (i can hardly type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon, i'm blown away. there is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world. this a great film. i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the hamilton/kalama crew, and i think they deserved mention. splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is!

i stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked. the story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves, waves that are monstrously huge, waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves. there is nothing special about the film, other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk. sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people. here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching. half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well. few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film. see it.

if you have seen dogtown and z-boys or have any interest in seeing the real, non-caricature, "real american" side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before.this film is "unreal", a facile term if ever there was one, but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of an opera, and the completely apparent sense of love, expert and knowing instilled by stacy peralta's direction and narration, this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.this film is a symphony, crafted as well as beethovens 9th, beginning beautifully with its prelude in hawaii, tugging deeply on human emotion in santa cruz and finishing with uproar, triumph and crescendo in laird hamiltons feats, again in hawaii.like classical music; like beethoven's 9th, ride of the valkyries or barbers adagio for strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. trust me.

i used to write comments at imdb, but i don't do so anymore. it happens that imdb has become massive, and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores. what do i mean? that anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject, watches some crap (or the opposite), and in case he likes it, delivers a 10, and if he doesn't he goes for a 1. this of course, cannot measure anything correctly. now for the film. i truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films, because then i must score this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. this documentary has something that i don't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film. it is simply mesmerizing, and it's not just a way of saying; it really is. the last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys-, that really... there's no possible match. i don't keep movies, rarely would i find any sense in doing so, but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by. i got nothing more to say. this is a genuine, objective 10 for me.

i rate this 10 out of 10. why?* it offers insight into something i barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; i have never surfed, but i love surfing movies, and have seen many. none taught me what this movie did * the movie was very well edited. it flowed well. the interviews were outstanding * it's interesting from start to finishin summary, it's about as good as a documentary as i have seen, so i have to rate in terms of that. so 10/10

this was the best documentary i've ever seen!! i just saw lords of dogtown and wanted to know more about stacy peralta, and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well. great job stacy! i was kicking back at work last week, bored o*&^%less and this movie came on. growing up in orange county in the 80's i surfed up and down the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager. i grew up at the beach, my parents took me every weekend, i body surfed, boogeyboarded then moved up from there. this movie just captivated me. it was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys went through..true pioneers! this movie is a collectors item.

there's been a spate of recent surfing movies that i seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning. i caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! the focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60's greg noll to our current laird hamilton, from waimea bay to mavericks to jaws. hell, i could watch a movie just about laird hamilton - one of this generation's great athletes - so the rest is just gravy. there's loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars, in pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious fashion. of all the surfing movies i've seen this tells the big-wave story the best, and i think it's my favorite. enjoy!

riding giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big-wave surfers, gregg noll, jeff clark, and laird hamilton. stacy peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job. the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration, interviews, animation and surfing footage. the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film, making riding giants brilliant viewing. personal highlights include any of greg noll's comments, what with his straight-to-the-point frankness, laird hamilton's footage at teahupoo, and the out-takes at the end of the movie. but really this entire film is one big, recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. it's a shame it isn't more well known, but it is a gem deserving of attention. 10/10

wow! stacy peralta has followed up dogtown and z-boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big-wave surfing culture in america. piecing together insider archival footage along with interviews from surfing legends, we are transported into the daring and free-spirited life of the early pioneers whose sheer passion for the sport spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millions.it's getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth. you can feel the respect peralta has for this group as we hear accounts of greg noll striding from a pack of awestruck fellow surfers on the beach to singularly challenge 50-foot swells off hawaii's north coast. or jeff clark, surfing the outrageously dangerous maverick off the northern california coast all alone for 15 years before it was discovered and became the surfing destination in california. and the storybook history of laird hamilton, today's surfing icon. hearing greg noll reverently refer to hamilton as the best surfer ever sent chills up my spine.(as an aside, noll, clark and others were at the sundance screenings. noll humbly described himself as an old, over-the-hill surfer. he was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film. both he and clark were as likable in person as they were in the film.)riding giants pays homage to these extraordinary athletes while at the same time rewarding us with an insight into the magnitude and terrifying power of the waves they seek to conquer, the gut-wrenching vertical drops required to get into them, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience each time they take on a monster swell.all this, and the movie has more. for those of us that didn't live in california in the 60's, we get an insight into the impact of surfing on american pop culture. (and, to my surprise, the impact of the movie gidget on surfing!) peralta also weaves in a primer on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment. i'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the sundance audience, i was absolutely captivated by this film. peralta is staking his claim as the big kahuna of american documentaries.

riding giants is a brilliant documentary that dives deep into the world of one of the most under-appreciated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only director stacy peralta could capture. everything from the structure, to the players, to the amazing stock footage, to even the style in which this was filmed only reinforced the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing. of all the surfing films that i have seen (endless summer, billabong odyssey, and step into liquid) this was the most consistent and relevant. beginning with the early ages of surfing (a brief history lesson) lasting all the way till laird's infamous ride, riding giants goes further into the mind, heart, and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries. how does it do this? by giving us the whole story, from start to finish, without fictionalizing or jig jagging from wave to wave.to begin this film was structurally sound. in the other films that i have seen about surfing, you sometimes find yourself jumping from new person to new person, wave to wave, event to event, without any knowledge of why or who? in riding giants, we have a very small cast of veterans and newbies. this allows you to really go deeper into the mind of each one. also, instead of just riding waves, we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before. this is what really attracted me to this film. i was impressed that instead of showing all these big waves (because it is a big wave movie), we listen to stories and see first hand what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves. i loved the information about the "beach bums" or father's of surfing. i am still floored by the amazing tales of greg noll and his early adventures into the harsh deep blue. then, to see him in person, talking about what was going on in his mind, only added more fuel to the fire. the straightforward structure that peralta followed allowed me to follow and walk away with more knowledge of the sport than with any of the earlier films. peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you cannot help but be amazed by what these brave people have done, and where the sport is going.add to a immaculate structure some intense and creative cinematography, and you have darn near perfect film. using techniques that i last saw in the kid stays in the picture, riding giants creates some scenes that almost feel as if they are jumping out of the screen. while it isn't 3d, it is that flat dimensional feeling that you get when you put two pictures on top of each other. in this film, it worked. it created more depth to the scenes, and really added to not just the shock value (man these waves were huge), but also the danger that these guys constantly faced. if it broke differently or they maneuvered wrong, these waves would kill them. some did die, but it didn't stop the sport. it only created more excitement and more passion to do better. it is this love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my final point.the human element. so many of my earlier adventures in the world of surfing documentaries left me with beautiful waves, but very little about the people. the films knew that people were watching for the waves, so it would basically go from wave to wave to wave and the maybe a short second about the person. this film was the direct opposite. peralta created this masterpiece by still giving us the waves, but devoting so much more attention onto the surfers and the immortal question of why they do this everyday. what rushes through their minds, what pushes them to go further, and the bonds that are formed while out there on the wild blue yonder. i felt like after watching this film that i not only knew more about big wave surfing, but also about the emotional side to the sport. this was an element not as developed in the other films and pushed riding giants to a whole new personal level.overall, this film was brilliant. never have i witnessed so much passion, devotion, and love wrapped in a structurally sound film. from beginning to end, i was impressed. i would be very happy if this film won the oscar this year for best documentary, and to see a new rebirth in the surfing world and open more doors for films of this nature.grade: ***** out of *****

in one of her first movies, romy schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain, as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of 18, learns to govern despite the machinations of the politicians, and eventually romances and marries prince albert of saxony. kitschy and campy (though surprisingly faithful to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. seeing this movie about british royals spoken in german adds to its quaint charm. on that front, one wonders why an austrian movie was made about an english queen; but then one remembers that in 1954, austria was still under occupation by allied troops, including british ones. maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.

don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic. this movie was shot in a lower budget ,probably against the will of ernest marishka, so he had to make due.for example england is portrayed as bordering on germany.by a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alone.they arrived their too quick. this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented, for the movie, was austrian. when she's told that she's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her, where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen? why isbn't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects ?low budget!where the audience back then aware of these imperfection? i wonder how the critics felt?durring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbn't excited about it. durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like " my old kentucky home" , and "old black joe". what? civil war songs in the 1830's? is romy schneider being portrayed as scarlet?where's mammy? is magna shnieder playing her too? is adrian hoven rhett or ashley? what was in marishka mind?well this add to the camp.it's unintentionally satirizing queen victoria'a story. this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected

i loved this movie. it was so well done! great acting and drama and historically accurate. i love romy schneider movies. this one rocks, not as great as sissi but still rocks! and scorpiolina,she commented and said french dubbing. well this is originally a german movie not french. so yea. second of all there was a plot, maybe your not familiar with history. oh and her mother played the part of her governess, not her teacher. and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria, maybe u missed that detail.but anyway.... yea the history in this movie is great, i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating! i love all the historical stuff. like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom. and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the "new type of dance" waltzing. when waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close. yea her governess was like oh my god!and also the clothes, i love the clothes. the styles are great, hoop skirts are awesome. and of course romy always looks very pretty.

ernst marischka, one of the most respected austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life. nowadays, if people should hear about him, they associate the name of marischka with sissi trilogy (1955,1956,1957). however, he made other excellent films like das dreimaderlhaus (1958), embezzled heaven (1958) and definitely this one, madchenjahre einer konigin showing the young years of queen victoria. although it deals with a slightly different theme than sissi films, i do not see many differences between this movie and sissi. they are strikingly similar.the movie is almost identical. the style, the music, the photography. in fact, the crew are almost the same. anton profes, bruno mondi!the cast... romy schneider's one of the first main roles. it was a lovely introduction to her role of sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the austrian empress. it is also a film where romy plays with her mother, magda schneider. but ernst marischka was not the first director who cast romy to play with her mum. romy's debut, wenn der weisse flieder wieder bluhn (1953) was her performance with her mother, too. therefore, there were some voices that romy began her austrian career on the bases of her mother's fame. indeed, there is some truth in it.again, like in sissi, this film shows love very gently. victoria meets prince albert in a little inn in dover. their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. and now...? what would it be showed like? only sex... but is it the only thing love is based on?i am grateful to ernst marischka for these movies. they had a soul and a message. some people may call them kitschy, but i will never give up admiring these films. they are impressive!!! unfortunately, highly underrated!

i have copies of both these movies the classic where robert blake is a mighty fine actor where most of the 1967 movie blake is more shown standing by a window in jail telling his childhood life where it makes since why he killed the clutter family doesn't show much in the classic of what really went on an doesn't tell us which one really done the killing but it's a great eye catcher really if you watch the 1996 movie in cold blood the classic makes a lot more sence .

the 1967 in cold blood was perhaps more like "the real thing" (think about it: would we really want to see the real thing?), but it was black and white in a color world, and a lot of people didn't even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to remake it for television. plus, if you remake it, you can show some stuff not shown in the original. the book in cold blood by truman capote was the first "nonfiction novel". truman's book was in fact not 100% true to the real story. i thought the canadian location sufficed for kansas pretty much for a tv movie. look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll: dick's womanizing, perry being an aspirin junkie, perry playing blues guitar.

this was a pretty good film. i'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but i didn't want to take a chance. anyway, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory. i can't remember the first passage he reads, but the second one is genesis 9:6. he says it's genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. it's too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the bible today. did anybody ever hear of john jay, the first supreme court justice in the history of this country? he said that the bible is the best of all books. too bad we've lost that view in america.

after reading the book, i happened across this dvd at wal-mart for 3 bucks and thought, sure, what the hell... i got the dvd and watched it last night. when i started watching it, i checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. i thought, ok cool... it seemed to run rather slowly, knowing the story and how much of it there was. by the time i got to the actual killings, i was like, "how much time does this have left?" checked. "one minute?! what the hell?!" i felt incredibly cheated, thinking that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall story.but then, i happily noticed that the dvd's scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2. i still had another hour and a half to go! i then sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more so than the first.i admit that i have not seen the 1967 original film (despite my sincerest desire to), i have however read the novel and felt that this was a fairly descent film, for a two-part tv miniseries, that is. i think the casting of the role of perry was completely wrong and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me, but still very well done. the first half drags on a bit, while the second half is much more gripping. i think they should have proportioned the movie more like capote did his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after, and 1/3 after the killers are arrested. instead, the film makes it more 1/2 before the murders, 1/4 after, and 1/4 after the killers are arrested. again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time, less compelling while making the first half drag on and on...now i look back and realize i have just made the same mistake about making things drag on and on, so i will shut the hell up. go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind! nick houston

although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this film is an exception. i didn't actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake, so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison.the story and the way it is written is no question: it is capote. there is no need for more words.the play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb. i have seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother. this time this certainty is raised to fact, no question. his play, just as well as the play of mr. edwards is clearly the top of all their profession.i recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves.

this two-part tv mini-series isn't as good as the original from 1966 but it's solid. the original benefited from a huge number of things---it was all in black and white, it had a great jazz score and it was filmed at the real locations, including the home of the doomed clutter family. that was important because in the book and in the original movie the home is very much a character itself.this remake was filmed in canada which i guess doubles okay for kansas. the story tries to be as sympathetic to perry as it dares to and eric roberts plays him as a somewhat fey person, his homosexuality barely hidden. the gentler take by roberts doesn't quite work in the end though because it's hard to believe that his version of perry smith would just finally explode in a spasm of murder. whereas robert blake's take on smith left you no doubt that his perry smith was an extremely dangerous character.anthony edwards was excellent as the bombastic, big-mouthed and ultimately cowardly dick hickcock, the brains of the outfit. his performance compares very well to scott wilson's role in the original movie.since this is a longer movie it allows more time to develop the clutter family and in this regard i think the 1996 movie has an advantage. the clutters are just an outstanding, decent family. they've never harmed another soul and it is just inexplicable that such a decent family is ultimately massacred in such a horrifying way. it still boggles my mind that, after the clutters were locked in the bathroom, that herb clutter didn't force out the window so at least his children would have a chance to escape. this movie has the thought occur to him, but too late. from what i read about the real home, which is still standing, the way the bathroom is configured they could've opened the counter drawers and effectively barricaded the door which would've forced the killers to blast their way in. but it might've bought time for some of the clutters to escape. why the clutters didn't try this, i have no idea.fans of the book will recognize that this movie takes a lot of liberties with how the crime is committed but not too serious. still, it's distracting to viewers like me who have read tons about the case. the actors playing the cops, led by sam neill and leo rossi, are uniformly excellent, much better, i think, as a group, than the actors in the original movie. they know that to secure the noose around the necks of both of them they have to get them to confess. and the officers come to the interview impeccably prepared. they had already discovered the likely alibi the phony story of going to fort scott, and had debunked every jot of it. the officers then let smith & hickcock just walk into their trap. hickcock is a b.s. artist who figures he can convince anyone of anything and the officers respectfully let him tell his cover story. but when they lower the boom on him, he shatters very quickly. it's very well filmed and acted and very gratifying to watch because the viewer naturally should loath hickcock in particular by this point, a cowardly con-man who needs the easily manipulated smith to do his killing for him. supposedly hickcock later stated that the real reason for the crime wasn't to steal money from the clutters but to rape nancy clutter. at least she was spared that degradation.the actors playing the clutters are very good, kevin tighe as herb clutter in particular. the story sensitively deals with mrs. clutter's emotional problems, most likely clinical depression, and mrs. clutter displays remarkable inner strength when she firmly and strongly demands that the killers leave her daughter alone. from what i've read the clutters' surviving family was particularly bothered by how bonnie clutter was portrayed in the book, claiming it was entirely untrue. but as an aside, both of the killers related to the police how mr. clutter asked them to not bother his wife because of her long illness. capote might make up that fiction to make the character of bonnie more interesting but certainly the killers had no reason to falsely portray mrs. clutter and no doubt much of the conversation in the book (duplicated in the movies) is right off the taped confessions of the killers. so it would've been nonsensical for herb to have said that and not have it be true.

like others, i have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the clutter killings, including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the participants to the crime -- including capote himself. as to capote, i cannot forgive him for willfully withholding perry smith's confessions, intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels. i believe truths and facts capote "reserved" for his "book," which required for capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment, would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for perry smith even under the old mcnaughton rule. capote himself could never write another major literary work after "in cold blood." shame and guilt. in my opinion, he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book/drama. to him, both men had to die for his book to succeed. the book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment. his actions and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion.capote's book is not truth. it is not factual or journalistic. it is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination. what most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of capote's mind, which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all. no wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer blake's performance. that actor is the nightmare from capote's dishonest imaginings.so who is to say how the two killers should be played? who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to "do it now" killing? i agree with the few who see in eric roberts' work a magnificent performance, shakespearean in its range, yet played with heartbreaking sincerity. anthony edwards takes a much safer "attitude mode" to create a smarmy hickok; but he is one-dimensional and boring, with only a few notes in his television range. roberts is almost four-dimensional, adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body, a frankenstein creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what not to do. like leopold apropos loeb, robert's perry smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man. without hickok or a man of his particularities, perry smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors. he fears himself more than he fears anything else in life.given the freedom from capote's death grip on the consciousness of the clutter killings, roberts and edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama. same facts, some of the same lines from the case record, but deeper, more complex, with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is.what many of our reviewers dislike about this film, roberts in particular, is that cold-blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand. that is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic "interpretation of life and death" than capote could ever create -- a real tragedy.the actual cold-blooded killer, mr. capote, and his hypocritically artistic "non-fiction novel" do not control these interpretations and performances.if "in cold blood" and capote's effect on life, literature and truth matters as much as scholars say, then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth, or a version of the truth, that is not the rank, cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of capote's own abyss.

i am from sweden and i have just seen this movie and the thing is that i thought it was okay. i have seen many bad comments about it but you must remember that a lot of people that watch this two parts miniseries are located all over the world and not just in usa. also remember that not everyone has ever heard of the film made in the 60:s and maybe not in the events(murders). and even more...that it can be hard to find the original movie and if so there always be people around that doesn't like black/white films. this one feels fresh and in color and will find its public. its 12 years old now but i just saw it for the first time. i will try to find the first one if i can to compare them but i haven't seen it anywhere in sweden. ofcorse there is internet but not for anyone in the world. the thing here is that this is mostly part of an american crime-history and was big in the 50-60:s in just usa but in rest of the world it just past by i guess. well it was told about for some time but 40 years later it will fade away in for example europa cause time goes by. we had our own problems and crimes so if someone will do a remake of the film and put it back in some light again its not a bad idea at all. a new generation can take part of this horrible story and even the film about capote that was released just a few years ago witch was a pretty good film too i think. it will boost interest to the events that took place some 50 years ago and maybe stop it to fall in sleep. it started me up and now i am looking for the robert blake-version so it wasn't that bad...huh? this are my opinions. some people will of course disagree but hey...its okay. sometimes there will be okay with remakes on old films. its not every time the old ones are that good. the film-making techniques has developed a lot and scenes can be made more realistic if they want today. its always a question of money of course. there has been so many movies that were made in the "good old days" but there were also money missing, bad directors etc, and they remakes them today (50 years later) and suddenly they are okay to watch. my friend got this box of old classic horror-movies and s/f and i cant say i was impressed of the so called good old days. most of them you cold put in the trashcan directly. they were so bad that we just sat there like zombies...could not move...like brain-dead. i cant recommend them to anyone. some of them i have seen remakes of and i remember liking them...but not the originals. they were just painful awful. this is like the old story of who was the best bond...moore or connery...i think if you see roger moore first you maybe find him the one to trust or like... thanks for me and i am sorry for my english, thats not so good. /lars from sweden

i first saw this film when i was about 13. it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now. but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it. what we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3d panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.this all makes for a great film story, but it worries me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate'.

this movie is using cinematography fantastically, the depth of the camera catches each character. denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes. how is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. a worrying idea. attenborough at his best since ghandi, this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these, no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid.though critised for the biased nature, the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace

i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984. steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. i didn't when finally in south africa in 1993. it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel' iafrika, my hair stood on its ends. there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples.

i have just finished watching this film in my gcse history class. it was thrilling and was a brilliant insight to what actually happened to steve biko during the time of the apartheid law. how anybody can say that this film was the most boring or dull 2 and a half hours of their lives i don't know because it had me hooked from start to finish. it was great how denzel washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the apartheid law and to get equal rights for black people. in one part steve biko says to a policeman we are just as weak and human as you are, this is to show them that he and all of the other black people in south africa were no different to the whites. donald woods inspired me because he fort for what he believed in and did not believe totally in apartheid. he and steve biko formed a very strong friendship that shook south africa and went on to awaken the world. i very much enjoyed this film and strongly recommend this to people. it helped me see that racism is not right and that everybody is equal, their fate should not be determined by the colour of somebody's skin. n

i keep watching this movie over and over and over. i have to watch it at least once a week. i am from africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that i didn't even know about africa. denzel's movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life. i wish he was my own brother. i have also seen and love your masala mississipi. what a thrilling situation. when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job, reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time. my brother was always caring for my old father and he wants to see me the same way too. by the way where did denzel get that african accent from in the cry freedom movie? i have first seen that movie in africa and i didn't know then that denzel was american till i moved down here.

i first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally, through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man.particularly moving was the funeral of steve biko, made even more vivid and hard-hitting by the south african anthem played at the time. i have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed - to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in south africa. i consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and i can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just south africa, but how we as white people perceive black people. i have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed, but after viewing this film i physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible. the greatest reward i can honestly say i have received - to be able to say that in my own small way i have contributed and redressed the balance a little. but if more people thought like me and actually did something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off.i challenge any right thinking person to watch cry freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in sharpville for refusing to learn afrikaans, the senseless murder of steve biko, such a champion for his own people's rights, and then, ultimately, to understand that all this is not merely a film, albeit a magnificent one, but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago.yes, my friends, watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard. i couldn't. i was too upset at knowing the truth. that is the hallmark of a great film. it was obviously the intention of sir richard attenborough to get this message over about south africa. of course he has achieved it. unless you happen to support apartheid. god help you.

"cry freedom" is not just a movie. it is a historical account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, steve biko, but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid. the story of biko, an influential leader, and his main "influencee", donald woods, is a heartbreaking one. but, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa. "cry freedom" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. it is because of great films like this one, that the public can become educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who sought to end them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. because of this importance, "cry freedom" is an amazing film that should be seen by all.

the performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again. however, i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director, attenborough's credits that puzzles me: aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent, long lasting film for the audience? i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one (possibly one of the "knowledgeable" personnel (insider) of the film.

this is a film that everyone should watch. quite apart from raising hugely important points (while south africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is superbly directed while denzel washington gives, in my opinion, the best performance in his career so far. kline also gives a good performance, although perhaps not as stunning as washington's. john thaw also puts in a good turn as the chief of police.there are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down, but all of these have been avoided. it would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys, but attenborough has not done this. sure, there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil, such as the captain at the soweto uprising, but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but i think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story, for it really is an incredible one.the best scene in the film is that of steve biko's funeral. when the whole crowd begins to sing the south african national anthem, it is probably one of, if not the most moving scenes i have seen.if you haven't seen this film already: watch it. it may not be comfortable viewing, but it's certainly worth it.

this film moved me beyond comprehension, it is and will remain my favourite film of all time, mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its 157 minutes. what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film, i have to put it into my dvd player, so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found, as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past 5 years. my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says "but your own words ask for direct confrontation, isn't that a direct call for violence?" biko replies "well you and i are in confrontation now, but i see no violence!!"craig robertson fife, scotland

what is "cry freedom" like? it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people. main character of the story is donald woods (kevin kline), chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa. woods writes several articles, where he speaks critically about views of steve biko (denzel washington). soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa (right from the top, even from the chief of police). when biko dies in police custody, woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it. but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place, so world can find out the truth.attenborough managed to make a good movie about people, with main message that black and white are the same, cause we are all people. story leads us to south africa and this (movie) is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie. this is movie from which we all can learn something. although it is a bit long, this story couldn't be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko. also relationship between woods and biko was shown great, just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through. but sometimes sacrifices must be made (biko's death) so the truth could be reveled (woods book).

steve biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british empire's colonialism in india. richard attenborough's film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell biko's story. the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of south african "police". woods, played by kevin kline, must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about biko or allow his wife, played by penelope wilton, to pressure him into forgetting about the books. in that case, biko dies in vain. what begins as a life-changing friendship between biko and woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after biko's death. oscar-nominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko, but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film. attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on biko's rise to prominence instead of beginning where biko befriended woods. perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour film wasn't exactly conducive to big box office, but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway. film politics aside, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, albeit, in pg-sanitized fashion. *** of 4 stars.

a long film about a very important character from south africa, stephen biko. he is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before their normal time. the already old film though does not show how important biko was, what he really represented. his life and his teaching is reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks. the film being from 1987, the objective was to push south africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation. so the film aims at showing how irrational the south african supporters of apartheid are, in 1987. to show this the film has to look beyond biko's death, hence to center its discourse not on biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living. his escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book on biko, after his death, and that can only happen in england. the film shows a way to escape south africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. so do not expect this way to be realistic and true. it could not be. but the film has tremendously aged because it does not show south africa with any historical distantiation, the very distantiation that has taken place under nelson mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out. the film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the indians. panegyric books or films all have that defect: they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view. that explains why the film has aged so much, seems to be coming from so long ago, as if nothing had changed at all. a remake is necessary.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne, university versailles saint quentin en yvelines, cegid

it's a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work. it has everything a historical film must have: a serious historical research, outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great direction.when i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie.

this is an absolutely incredible film. it shows south african racism from the perspective of the victims, and provokes a feeling of anti-racism in everyone who sees it. it is the best historic film i have ever seen.

'cry freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth.the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods (played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein). while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko's death.although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods'. i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko's story be heard around the world much more interesting.

richard attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the academy award winning 'gandhi', back in '83. i didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across 'cry freedom', released back in 1987. while it may not have been as popular as his gandhi, it is every bit as gripping, if not more, and was released when south africa still had not got rid of the shackles of apartheid. while most movies on social issues come out after the event had happened, i guess this one released during the time.the story is based on real life characters and events. the book on which the movie was based, was written by donald woods (kevin kline), a journalist who used to work in south africa until the end of the seventies. it traces the origins of woods friendship with the charismatic black leader steve biko, who is wonderfully portrayed by denzel washington. i cannot imagine a better choice for the role. washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence, which biko's character required.while initially, woods was against what he felt was black racism being spread by biko, after meeting the man, he could not help being drawn into his struggles and ideas. the bond between them grows stronger, and woods and his family realise and become more sensitive to the plight of the people biko represents.however, finally, tragedy strikes, and woods must now concentrate on escaping from south africa, with his book, so that he can get it published and let the outside world know what is going on. the second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from south africa, along with his family, and will keep you on tenterhooks.there are some deliciously humorous dialogues too. the scene between biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example.lawyer: do you advocate violence? biko: i advocate a confrontation. lawyer: well, isn't that violence, mr. biko? biko: not necessarily. you and i are having a confrontation now, but i don't see any violence.however, there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that pervaded the country before better sense prevailed. the scene where the army opens fire on a protest by school children is gut wrenching and heartbreaking.this is definitely a must watch. i would suggest those not familiar with attenborough's work, do take time out for this. there are movies which make a lot of money. and there are movies which make lives. i would any day prefer the latter.

what a brilliant film. i will admit it is very ambitious, with the subject matter. at a little over two and a half hours, it is a very long film too. but neither of these pointers are flaws in any way. cry freedom, despite the minor flaws it may have, is a powerful, moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist steve biko in his struggles to awaken south africa to the horrors of the apartheid. it is true, that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact. people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko. i may be wrong, but although it is biko's story, it is told in the perspective of woods, so woods is an important character in conveying biko's story to the world.cry freedom visually looks amazing. with the show-stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast. the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot. george fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes. it was subtle in scenes in the second half, but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes. the script was of exceptional quality, the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff. the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about, whether it was the police's attack of the south african citizens or biko's death. the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch, but is compensated by how it is shot, performed and written. and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well. the performances were exceptional from the entire cast, from the most minor character to the two leads, there wasn't a single bad performance. regardless of the accents that is, but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in. denzel washington in one of his more understated performances, gives a truly compelling performance as biko, and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy, for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of washington's. and the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note. penelope wilton is lovely as donald's wife wendy, and she is a great actress anyway. out the supporting performances, and there may be some bias, two stood out for me. one was timothy west, who relishes his role as captain dewet. the other was the ever exceptional john thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo-role as kruger. lord richard attenborough's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual.overall, a truly wonderful film. ambitious and long it is, but never ceases to be compelling, powerful and achingly moving. a definite winner from lord richard attenborough, and worthy of a lot more praise. 10/10 bethany cox

i think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so i would just like to write about the impact this film had on me.i first saw this film the year of it's release around 1987. my school organised a trip to the cinema to see it, for an re project i think. we all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! little did we know what we were about to experience. to this day i still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends. i think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way .it had such an impact on me that i joined the anti apartheid movement the same year.i think it served it's purpose in my case.

what a movie! i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him. gandhi has always left me indifferent, apart from ben kingsley's performance, and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker. but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times. it's an exciting, mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washington.kline plays donald woods, a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko. it starts as a difficult friendship, for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites. but biko, with his kind words, upbeat attitude and complete transparency, wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about.biko is a decent, law-abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people. one night, coming from an illegal meeting, he's arrested and beaten to death. the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa. but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out. but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police.this movie has an interesting structure. it has in fact two narratives: first it narrates the life and death of biko. it's an amazing first half, completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet.the second half, no less interesting, narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko. woods has become an enemy of state, a banned person, which means he can't meet people or leave his country. plus he's constantly spied by the police. kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too.although the first half is quite straightforward, the second does interesting things with editing, by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans. some may argue this is to make it more interesting, but for me the second half just as captivating, as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africa.the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears. george fenton and jonas gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it. although i've never been much of a fan of fenton (cannot stand his gandhi score), i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema. the movie, thanks to the music married to the powerful images, at times reached incredible peaks of emotion.cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington. this is a movie to be cherished in its entirety. acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the pianist, life is beautiful and the shawshank redemption.

"the true story of the friendship that shook south africa and awakened the world." richard attenborough, who directed "a bridge too far" and "gandhi", wanted to bring the story of steve biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist donald woods went through in order to get his story told. the films uses wood's two books for it's information and basis - "biko" and "asking for trouble".the film takes place in the late 1970's, in south africa. south africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race. the blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army. we are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants. then we are introduced to donald woods (kevin kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. after publishing a negative story about black activist steve biko (denzel washington), woods goes to meet with him. the two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to woods. this encourages woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring steve biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's south africa and to the world. soon, steve biko is arrested and is killed in prison. now woods and his family are daring to escape from south africa to england, where woods can publish his book about steve biko and the apartheid.when i first heard of "cry freedom", i was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of steve biko. i had never actually heard of steve biko before i seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time. but it's more about the story of donald woods and his journey across the border into lesotho as he tried to elude the south african officials. woods was put on a five year type house arrest after steve biko was killed. so in order to publish his manuscript on steve biko, he had to escape. because the manuscript would be considered treason in south africa and that could have resulted in woods meeting a fate similar to that of biko's. the real donald woods and his wife acted as consultants to this film.denzel washington is only in the film for the first hour, and i was disappointed with that as i was expecting to see him for the entire movie. but he was amazing as steve biko, and captured his personality from what i've read really well and his accent sounded perfect. his performance earned him an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. kevin kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as donald woods, and penelope wilton is excellent as his wife wendy.filming took place in zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in south africa. while in south africa, the south african gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring zimbabwe instead. despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid didn't end 'til seven years later, "cry freedom" wasn't banned in south africa. but cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats.richard attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. he doesn't hold back at the end of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them. the film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths. many had "no explanation". quite a few were "epilepsy", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs or were "suicide from hanging". no one will ever know what really happened to them, but i think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; or to be more precise, at the hands of the police. "cry freedom" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of steve biko. it's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence.

very rarely does denzil washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for kevin kline and in this case , this must count as one of their best films. it is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of steve biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend donald woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt , putrid society south africa was. the direction is outstanding from david attenborough as it was for gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film. two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie .what is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras. thousands of people in both films. this film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it. 8 out of 10.

it's sad to view this film now that we know how the anc got shafted by international capitalism. biko died for nothing much. woods achieved little. yes, outright apartheid was abolished, but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites, leaving the anc government more or less impotent. as naomi klein writes in the shock doctrine, in the talks between the black and white leaderships "the deklerk government had a twofold strategy. first drawing on the ascendant washington consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy, it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making --- such as trade policy and the central bank --- as "technical" or "adminsitrative". then it used a wide range of new policy tools --- international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts, economists and officials from the imf, the world bank, the gatt and the national party --- anyone except the liberation fighters from the anc." the statistical results are horrifying, with not much change accomplished, and aids flourishing. viewing cry freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic. the anc has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem.

an overlong, but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods. the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other out, but the second half isn't as strong, due to the elimination of the biko character. still, its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time. overall, a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit. 7/10.____________________________________

as anyone old enough knows, south africa long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. one of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was steve biko, who was murdered in jail. following the murder, reporter donald woods sought to get biko's message out to the world.in "cry freedom", woods (kevin kline) befriends biko (denzel washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. when woods attempts to spread biko's word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. the last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.as one of two movies (along with "a world apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "cry freedom" stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved.

cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours. famed director richard attenborough (gandhi) is certainly no stranger to the genre, and the collaboration of the real-life mr. and mrs. woods, the main white characters in their book and in this film, lends further authenticity to cry freedom. the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release. while the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws: uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular, another possible flaw (the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the african ones) may work out as a strength. viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film (as i think it should, over its artistic merits), the story is one which black africans know only too well, though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact. it is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience, hopefully driving them to change. now twelve years after the movie's production, cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place, 1987's cry freedom's ideals remain by and large unrealized. it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans, particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it, and absorb the film's messages. in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust's exposure, south africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories: cry freedom, cry the beloved country (ok, count it twice if you include the remake), and sarafina (did i miss one?). all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles. not one south african actor has played a major role, white, coloured, indian or black!). and yes i did miss another international south african drama, mandela and deklerk. though this (also highly recommended) biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted, mandela was played by a black american (sidney poitier, who also starred in the original s.a.-themed cry the beloved country), while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a (bald) very british michael caine, a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti-british feelings. until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy, cry freedom is about as authentic as you'll get. as villified as the whites (particularly the afrikaners) are portrayed in the film, any observant (non-casual) visitor to south africa even now in 1999, not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place, will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained, even understated. looking at cry freedom in hindsight, it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all, and it is. but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet, and that the black africans' goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing. this is why if you're a novice to the situation, cry freedom, is your best introduction.

billed as the story of steve biko -- played excellently by denzel washington, as you'd expect -- this was actually more the story of donald woods, played by kevin kline.this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good in the role.attenborough gave this the sort of direction you'd expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across.the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job, in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past.

this film is, quite simply, brilliant. the cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. this is the story of donald woods, a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. kevin kline is completely convincing - so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later, i recognised him from kline's portrayal. denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance, as ever.i urge you to watch this. it is long, but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. remember, folks, this really happened.

i show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless: why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed. why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy. this is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of steven biko and the journalism of donald woods. it also gives an important lesson of free speech: "you can blow out a candle, but you can't blow out a fire. once the flame begins to catch, the wind will blow it higher." (from biko by peter gabriel, on shaking the tree).

while this movie's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been, this is still a very good film. in fact, it was seen as an excellent film in its day, as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar (losing to wings). i still consider wings to be a superior film, but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead, emil jannings.jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra. his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call--to play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution. naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting-wise, but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution.exactly what happens next i'll leave to you, but it's a pretty good film--particularly at the end. by the way, look for william powell as the russian director. despite being made in 1928, with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films.

russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928 (william powell) is casting his epic about the russian revolution, and hires an old ex-general from the czarist regime (emil jannings) to play the general of the film, and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared (evelyn brent), of 11 years before.try as i might, i feel it hard to warm to 'the last command' for all its virtues. 'the docks of new york' was indubitably a great film, and 'underworld' is a film i have always been craving to see, but 'the last command' is rather heavy-going. the premise is fascinating, but the treatment does really make the script come to life, except in the sequences set in hollywood, depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state-of-the-art technology.emil jannings is, predictably, a marvelous russian general, distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex-general, transfixed in his misery, and the vigorous, hearty officer of yore.the ending is great and worth the wait, but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times.

the last command (1928) is a silent film directed by josef von sternberg.it shows us czarist general, grand duke sergius alexander (emil jannings) in his days of glory.in 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial russia he has nothing.he also had the love of a woman, natalie dabrova (evelyn brent).about ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution.his old enemy lev andreyev (william powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not.the last command is very good silent drama.emil jannings does memorable role work in the lead.evelyn brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.william powell is great as always.there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie.like many scenes with jannings and brent.and then there is the ending with powell and jannings.this is a movie that touches in many parts.

1927, and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade. now that it had become the site of a multi-million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established, some of those in the calmer quarters of this film-making factory were taking the time for a little self-reflection. the last command, while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times, frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality, and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal. it was written by lajos biro, who had been on the scene long enough to know.taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood's most celebrated immigrants  emil jannings. before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy, being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well-timed performance, often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has-beens. he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter, and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings's scenery-chomping caricatures. however, as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range, showing by turns delicate frailty, serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale. he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration (the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety), but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance.the director was another immigrant, albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry. nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister (the "von" was made up, by the way), and took a very distinctive approach to the craft. of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone, a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes. we open with a carefully-constructed chaos with movement in converging directions, which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen. then, when jannings arrives, everything settles down. jannings's performance is incredibly sedate and measured, and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order.sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence, allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen, and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic. in fact, he really seems to have an all-round lack of interest in action. in the scene of the prisoners' revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance, his camera eventually retreating to a fly-on-the-wall position. compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent, which are a complex medley of point-of-view shots and intense close-ups, thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction.as a personality on set, it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell, and in fact powell's portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on. unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with, and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones, the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired. while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically, it appears no-one told his co-stars they were not in a comedy. evelyn brent is fairly good, giving us some good emoting, but overplaying it here and there. the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself. it's a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless, like a male ninotchka, but he does a good job, revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard-hearted exterior.the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices, as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film-making process, even a relatively tame example like this. at the very least, i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the "behind-the-scenes" view, as it threatened the mystique of movie-making which was still very much alive at this point. as it turned out, such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor, as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and (according to some sources, although the issue is a little vague) a nomination for best picture. this is significant, since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self-indulgent back-slapping by the hollywood elite. but elite or not, they recognised good material when they saw it, and were willing to reward it.

josef von sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former imperial general to the czar of russia who has found himself there. emil jannings won a well-deserved oscar, in part, for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general. the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country's fall to revolutionaries. william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts jannings in his film. the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes tinseltown in the early days. von sternberg delivers yet another classic, and one that is filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue, and tragedy.

an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution. however, he is not any ordinary extra. he is serguis alexander, former commanding general of the russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene, which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in, to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in russia and was humiliated by alexander. it can now be the time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. this is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by von sternberg, providing the greatest irony in alexander's character in every way he can. jannings deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley. powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as jannings' love. all around brilliance. rating, 10.

a true story about a true revolution, 25 of april ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years, that was imposing a colonial war on it's military's, for maintaining an empire (angola, mozambique, guine-bissau, cabo verde, s. tomé e principe; the first and the last of the great colonial empire's of europe) of 600 years, since it's beginning in the conquest of ceuta in 1415; a revolution by the army for the people, and for a democratic portugal; the most's surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it (except those that died in the hand's of pide, the political police of the state, during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it's headquarters in the day of the revolution, in 25 of april 1974, has it show's on the film).and has all revolutions it has it's heroes, one them of was captain salgueiro maia, a returned soldier from the war, whose convictions along with the rest of the army, was that they were fighting (since 1961) a hopeless war, and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it's country.

principally it is the story of two men who were part of the portuguese revolution. it was easy to understand the contest, but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else, or they shows also the period before or after this fact, here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts. it could also be seen as a kind of documentary. the movie focalize to these two people, showing as normal they were, not like common heroes, because the revolution come from people. although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just "capitaes" as the main characters. nice colors and lights during the whole movie, excellent work for the director being her first movie, she doesn't fall to the banal way. well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. the character of maia (main one)is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for stefano accorsi, able to show maia's limits, this not-being an hero.

you know? our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... i can explain, i think!! well... until that happen on 25th april 1974, our freedom was limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! that's all a consequence of the revolution! i think that's clear!... about the movie... i think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies it's quite good!! i like it very much!

"capitães de abril" is a very good. the story isn't a documentary about the 1974 revolution in portugal. but it gives us an idea of how it was like. the fiction of the story isn't of great interest, but it doesn't spoil the movie. the heroic actions of captain salgueiro maia aren't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds. captain salgueiro maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th of april revolution.all the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. lisbon looks beautiful as ever. don't miss it! i liked this film very much.

being half-portuguese doesn't render me half-blind (nor half-prejudiced) when discussing portuguese films. not that i get to do that very often anyway. but this film was such a rush of adrenaline! yes, that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went/goes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory: things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. and by god did they get it right! ok, to sum it up: very emotional if you've lived through it, but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were. if you're just watching it randomly, you're in for a good historical romp, only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual. even by european standards, yes.

probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life, and i enjoyed it. the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. mozambique, angola, and guinea (bissau)- cape vert. most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including spinola, who took over as the new president. the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.

i found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950's culture-clash movie. john wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in harrods. but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona, and he accomplished his task with style. the duke was a guy who really could act well. his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle.despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to dominate this movie. many of his good intentions came a cropper. he had authority over nobody, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian.the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles. i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well. there was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props. the set pieces were complex and detailed. a lot of money and thought had been applied to it.the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort. script was good without being too wordy. there was a great deal of japanese dialogue, but the lengthy periods of translation didn't interfere with the narrative. it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set. whether or not they were japanese, i couldn't say. but anyway they looked the part. at least the leads were not played by cross-dressing caucasians, unlike other efforts such as 'blood alley' (yes, i know they were chinese) 'the inn of the sixth happiness' or even 'the king and i'.frankly, i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. the script was better for a start. i never liked the songs in 'the king and i', and wasn't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'blood alley'. i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke's more popular outings.recommended.

in the barbarian and the geisha, john wayne plays townsend harris, a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s. before him, commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853. harris, who arrived just a bit later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance--as many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty. all this is true and shown in the film. according to some other sources i found, the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film (hence, the title).my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise. john wayne as a diplomat?! when he's being diplomatic in most films, he says please and thank you as he pummels people!!!! so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed. in fact, i can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role. by the way, i've seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all.however, despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting, the film is still very watchable. the color cinematography is nice, the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad. all in all, a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting.ps--read through the trivia for this film. you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director (john huston) where wayne apparently knocked him out!! based on what i've read about huston and the way he got along with actors, this is an incident i tend to believe. and, it's also a nice example of john wayne "diplomacy".

this is very much not the sort of movie for which john wayne is known. he plays a diplomat, a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action. the film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story.for the open-minded, the patient and the thoughtful, this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history.there are two intertwining stories. the big story is of internalised, isolationist japan and externalised, expansionist america clashing when their interests conflict. the small, human, story is of an outsider barbarian (wayne) and a civilised geisha's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love. the human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations.the movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well. the two lead roles are performed to perfection. john wayne is excellent as townsend harris, striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the japanese. eiko ando is likewise excellent as the geisha of the title, charming and delightful. the interaction between her character and john wayne's is particularly well portrayed. this is exactly how these two individuals (as they are depicted in the film) would have behaved.the script is very well written. it lacks all pomposity. and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred. the characters are real people, not self-consciously "great" figures from history. furthermore, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. indeed, the clash of a traditionalist, and traditionally powerful, isolationist japan and a rising, newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between john wayne and the local japanese baron. wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in japan, and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water. the baron responds that japan just wants to be left alone. wayne's character replies that japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping, and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway. a very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right, and saw the other as being in the wrong. the resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history, a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future.cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century japan, before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century, is excellent. a visual treat, and an enlightening insight into japan's ancient civilisation.i highly recommend anyone, whether a john wayne fan or not, to watch this film if you get the chance. just be aware that it isn't an action film. it is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a slow-boiling love story which (much to their surprise) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. watch this film on its merits, without preconceptions, allow yourself to be immersed in its story, and you will thoroughly enjoy it.all in all, an excellent film.

an interesting look at japan prior to opening to the west. john wayne as america's first consul to japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from perry's gunboat diplomacy. he is not welcome. wayne eventually wins his meeting with the shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an american ship, under control. there follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the shogun, including a bottle of old tanglefoot. the meeting with the shogun, the debates among the japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period. altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
