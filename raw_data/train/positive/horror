just two comments....seven years apart? hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling-power! as has been mentioned, the low-budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.true, the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror - only without much horror. more a case of intrigue! gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the "house" as the main suspect. the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard. it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.having picked the dvd up for a mere $3.95 last week at my regular video store, i cannot begrudge the expenditure. $10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. just don't expect fireworks!

the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico. this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch. karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty, greedy and backbiting no-count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will. pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place. onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of "tintorera" infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character. the clunky, plodding (non)direction, trite by-the-numbers script, ugly, washed-out cinematography, ridiculous murder set pieces (a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon!), overwrought string score, morbid gloom-doom atmosphere, largely lousy acting (karloff notably excepted), cheesy mild gore, poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm. a real campy hoot.

this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces ("the fall of the house of usher", "dance of death" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. it is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, "the cat and the canary", "the old dark house", "night of terror" and so on). boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. he dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. i won't go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries.watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.dan basinger 8/10

this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen. the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. the casts is outstanding, including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before, ever. the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. my one complaint, i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other then that i think they did a great job. the dialog, the characters and the story was perfect. the acting was wonderful. this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. you heard me, the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10.

without kirsten miller this project needn't have been completed. however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it. it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained. mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.

another aussie masterpiece, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well. it doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks, it focuses more on emotional impact. a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney & co. bring to life. it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside, and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. strange things begin to happen in the house, and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. highly recommended. 8/10

after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century australian street, we meet julie (rebecca gibney) and peter (john adam) as they go out house hunting. they manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. it just may be haunted.13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker.the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. the opening "thriller scene" features some wonky editing. freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action. suspense should be created from staging, not fancy "fix it in the mix" techniques. there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity. the tracking and the cuts need to be slow. the attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked. as it stands, the scene has a strong "made for television" feel, and a low budget one at that.after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror (1979), though the budget forces a much subtler approach. millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.for some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. but morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. the material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. the performances help create tension. there isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. but neither menace is really the point.the point is human relationships. there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. that it's in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems. peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with "normal" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. at the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness, as a tv movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions. anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. it certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a dvd (that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it's worth a rental, and it's definitely worth watching for free.

why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy ? it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6. proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die. the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining.i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. 6/10 come on yankies get your english up to par !

masters of horror: right to die starts late one night as married couple abby (julia anderson) & ciff addison (martin donovan) are driving home, however while talking cliff is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road. cliff's airbag works ok & he walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for abby hers didn't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body. abby's life is saved, just. she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns. cliff decides that she should die, his selfish lawyer ira (corbin bersen) thinks they should let abby die, sue the car manufacturer & get rich while abby's mum pam (linda sorenson) wants to blame cliff, get rich & save abby. however abby has other plans of her own...this american canadian co-production was directed by rob schmidt (whose only horror film previously was wrong turn (2003) which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode) & was episode 9 from season 2 of the masters of horror tv series, while i didn't think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i've seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still doesn't come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution (2006). the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i'd say it's a bit uneven, the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abby's life & the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart. the character's are a bit clichéd, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum & the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is ok, the story moves along at a nice pace & overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here & there where it loses it's focus a bit & i wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending.director schmidt does a good job & there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out-and-out blood & gore. there are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there's shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross (images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser (1987) & it's sequels), then there's the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box! very messy. there are also various assorted body parts. there's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked...technically right to die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant & as most masters of horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made-for-tv show which basically if the truth be told it is. the acting was fine but there's no big 'names' in this one.right to die is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene! well worth a watch... for those with the stomach.

what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining. "right to die" is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore.spoilers here: top credits also go to the dead-on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. playing the character in a great "aloof" fashion, you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails. corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts.end of spoiler.as a revenge-from-the-dead flick, "right to die" benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour.

this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh, i think mick garris has a problem with women... he kill'em all, they are often the victims (screwfly solution, pro-life, valerie on the stairs, i don't remember the argento's episode in season 1, etc., obviously imprint). i think he enjoys to watch women been burn, torture, mutilated and i don't know. never least "right to die" is one of the best, with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense (specially with the photos from the cell scene, wonderful). the acting is like the entire series, regular i could be worst like "pro-life" or "we scream for ice cream". also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. the ideology of the series is horrible, killing and terminating women, mutilating animals and on and on... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like "cigarrette burns" (the best of all), "homecoming" (the most funny), "imprint" (really shocking).

i'm not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a "master" in the genre of horror, since he previously just directed one horror film called "wrong turn" and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre, but fact is that he made with "right to die" one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the "masters of horror" franchise. there was a similar underdog story in season one, when william malone made on of the best episodes with "the fair haired child" even though his other long feature films "fear dot com" and "house on haunted hill" sucked pretty badly.the story of "right to die" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery, the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney (corbin bernsen of "the dentist") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff. meanwhile abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. after a few victims, cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. "right to die" is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv-series concept like "masters of horror". it's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard. great "moh" episode; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons.

well its about time. i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries. while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries, at least this episode turned out well. its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season. in "right to die" we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey. at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation. abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back. while they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises, but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire. and this is just the setup people. once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes. there's also a side effect too. every time she flatlines, abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people. hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever. from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it, right to die should have the right to go on living forever.

a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.this comes to us from director rob schmidt, who made "wrong turn" (a film i have not seen). with only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting schmidt to be a "master of horror" in only the most liberal sense. my apologies to him for my underestimation. as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.the issue of the "right to die" is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device. however, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves. once the horror elements show up, the film goes from "decent" to "spectacular". great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. i was a little creeped out at times (which is good) and most of all: the gore is in extreme abundance! i read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of "hellraiser" in this. through the first part of the show, i had no idea what they were talking about. then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of "hellraiser 2". however, i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. i can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than "hellraiser 2".some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look. i didn't watch it a second time, but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had (not that it's confusing). the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him. he's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will. i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he's completely unlovable.while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i'm excited about the "washingtonians" episode, i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. when legends like john carpenter let me down (again) i get a bit worried about the genre's future, but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope. this one is a keeper, and please bring schmidt back for season 3!

fans of the hbo series "tales from the crypt" are going to love this moh episode. those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat.underrated indie favorite martin donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. in the case of right to die, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (robin sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, abbey (julia anderson). when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of "making up," and she's horribly burned in a fire, he's reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (corbin bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.) but abbey's never been one to give up without a fight, and that's where the ec-theme of the episode comes in. cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky (and ooky) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception. if anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.and that's not to mention that john esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. you don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas, and you're there.)not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! as with most moh episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.

i was all ready to pan this episode, seeing that this 'master' really doesn't have any horror films under his belt.. but this is easily the best episode of the season.the acting was good!! i don't know how he wrangled it, but we've got some real talent in this episode! and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise, at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins, something that has been lacking up to this point in the series.i especially liked the bit at the end, not a twist per say, but just a funny little bit where he becomes, as ever, the hen-pecked hubby.really good effort. like i've said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes.. but they may someday end up being masters in the future.

maybe it's just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one got under my skin (pardon the pun). this piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies. not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the "screwee", i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself. some parts are very reminiscant of "hellraiser", but come off as tribute rather than imitation. it's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile. this piece brings it and doesn't appologize. i liked this one a lot. do not watch whilst eating pudding.

this was a superb episode, one of the best of both seasons. down right horror for a change, with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes, if there is such a thing. a man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck, in which he was driving. his airbag worked, her's didn't. she is burned beyond recognition (great makeup btw), and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft. but, even in a coma, she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology, and when she does die for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. carnage of course ensues, and also some extremely gory killings, and also, some extremely sexy scenes. what more could you ask for, you might ask? well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical ending, that should leave a smile on most viewers faces. i just loved rob schmidt's (wrong turn) direction too, he has a great knack for horror. excellent episode, this is one i'm buying for sure.

this movie has to be my favorite of all time. its not supposed to have a plot, because its makers wanted people (charlie sheen, i think)to believe it was a real snuff film. this was an exercise in visual effects, and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does. movies these days are now all about sound effects, leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood. there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing. there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film. have you seen the hills have eyes 2? the rape scene was funny instead of shocking. although i'm sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror. but since they probably suck at making films, they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off. the movie "baise moi" has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks.its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an ao or nc-17 rating. i'm sure eli roth has the ability/talent to make his hostel film series much much better, but he has too tame it down to get an r rating...or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations.watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage (accident & crime scenes/footage). don't forget that this movie was made in 1985. the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film. that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics.

this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of. the japanese people (?) who star in this must have been really desperate for a job, or we're just friends. here's the scoop:three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman, they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her, they burn her, kick her, spin here around in a chair (over 200 times!), they use sound torture (by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! it don't sound that bad at all, but it can make you go nuts). they throw guts (probably from an animal) at her while shes knocked out, and she freaks when she wakes up. and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen!if you have not heard of these films, and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film, you will think it is! (just ask charlie sheen) this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick! like i said pure underground. check it out if you are a fan of underground horror, or foreign gore. if your not i highly recommend you read-up on the series before watching! from the gore, shock, and creativity aspect it gets a 10, but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1. an underground classic...my final rating is a 8/10

i first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick "snuff". i was told that devil's experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set. i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one, so my interest was peaked.devil's experiment is a short film with no story, no character development. just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. they torture her in various ways like beating her, spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a mallet, burning and putting maggots on the burns, throwing guts at her, and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.i must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes. but then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. the worst is the eye scene. i didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought "damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie". i did enjoy the flick but i don't know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10

this is the first out of the guinea pig series, and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection.it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films. i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date. so i popped this sucker in and sat down.from what i had read on the internet, and realizing the content involved in this film, i was expecting to test my nerves in full force. this ended up not being the case.the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point, and how long a human can tolerate pain.sounds like one sick flick right? wrong. the film fails to shock. this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror, but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease.on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence. including the ripping out of fingernails, intestines thrown at an unconscious woman, and a needle through the eye.overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it, but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one.

guinea pig: the devil's experiment is without a doubt ***** stars on first view, its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. this movie gets right to the point, you may be thinking what point? the point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore. this movie has some gore, more or less just torturing a women violently. there are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore. i'll tell you one thing though guinea pig: the devil's experiment makes hostile look like sesame street. if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain't seen the half of it until you've seen guinea pig: the devil's experiment.movie rating 0-5, gore 0-10guinea pig: the devil's experiment (uncut) ***** (7)

i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie... i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best.even though ive seen the "making of", i still have doubts when watching those 35mins of pure torture : its that powerful.a 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do : be the best fake snuff film ever made.

after having watched "guinea pig", two questions come in mind ( besides 'am i really a psychopath to watch that ?' ) : 'is it a snuff ?' the answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie i've ever seen. and then : 'where the hell have they found that girl ?'. because she gets tortured for '45 min, without any reasons given ( in fact, there is nothing else in this movie !) : fingernails teared off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested by maggots, ... and many more until the final scene ( i'm still not sure how they did that ). because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene', it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money. so what were her ( their ) motivations ?i saw it in japonese without subtitles, but it's not a problem ( no real dialogues, the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes ). i haven't seen yet all the serial, but the first "guinea pig" is not known for being the best one. still i've rated 8, because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff, the issue is quite good ( ask charlie sheen, the actor ). but i think they could have gone further, which they did in the following ones.another movie i'm hiding from my parents.8/10

this movie has no story. it's only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death.!!!spoilers!!!this is what they do: they beat her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood, spin her around on a chair until she pukes, expose her to loud noise, pour boiling oil on her, put worms in her sores, crush her hand with a sledge-hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye.this movie was so realistic that if i didn't know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff-movie. although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it. it scared me. i guess it fills some kind of purpose. i give it a 10/10.

i have seen the short movie a few years ago. after that i watch all sequels. the first one is really not the best - but it's the most popular one. i've already watch the making of guinea pig 1. it's really great what these guys did. also the sequels are excellent in the special effects. take your chance to watch it!

this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best. at the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways. a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and it includes a manga video, showing the torture. the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die. some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times, because you see punches in nearly every movie. this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people 17 or older.9/10

the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye punctured with a needle, and so forth.in the most nauseating scene, the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns. the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen, believing the series to contain actual murder, attempted to ban its distribution in the united states. an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers -- sick re-creations using nasty, but obvious special effects. gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic-book artist hideshi hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms. but, gorehounds probably won't find anything special.

what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said? well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks. how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know. im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was. however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real. and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me.

wow, alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here. wonderful. my name is steve and i run unearthed films. we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america. now before you ask why am i writing a review? instead ask why some people bash it. i'm writing this review because i love the guinea pig films. why do i love em, it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go. i've seen it all. almost every horror film known to man, argento, fulci, bava, buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster. i've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films. why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place. this review is for the devils experiment. i find it devoid of story which is fine by me. why do i watch horror films? so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people. the devils experiment not only delivers but that's all it is. pure unadulterated violence. yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold. why do people bash it. cause they like a story, so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story. it make em feel better about themselves. we all want blood and gore. it's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story. the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.i'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world. maybe i shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe i should. my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not. i've always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films. sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place. the devils experiment is not for everybody. it's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only. if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those. but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you. there is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years. they are wrong, disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom, unless she is totally cool. good luck, enjoy and never stop living your life.

a lot of people unfairly sh!t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining. devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work--not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic--especially for the video's vintage and low-budget.let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know: this film is an "extreme" torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid-80s. it's plot as it stands is simple: a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. this entails brutal violence--all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.the actress who plays the victim of the "experiment" is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera. her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling. some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes.if you haven't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot. 8.5/10 for devil's experiment.

the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her.she is beaten savagely,spun around in the chair endlessly,has her finger nails pulled,animal guts are thrown at her,hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle(really sick and nasty scene).the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape.of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome.i have seen also "flowers of flesh and blood" which is more gory and sadistic,but less disturbing.anyway,this one is a must-see for horror fans!

first off, this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to. the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema, apparently its the other way around. if one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. but really thats all it was aiming for, it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value (and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions). i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific (in non-shock sense) it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid/pessimistic(i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured)

but sadly due to rights issues, that almost certainly will never happen. transcripts of joe bob's commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet, but they don't quite capture his twang inflected delivery, which was a real hoot. nowadays, joe bob (real name: john bloom) is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as "i spit on your grave" (featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time), and jason x, one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time (the series was never the same once it left paramount). all i could think when they canceled it was: "damn, where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping, blonde jokes, and horror trivia every saturday night? does this mean i have to get a life now?" sadly, it does. but there'll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for "monstervision." long live the drive-in!

monstervision was a show i grew up with. from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one, the only, joe bob briggs. the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years, and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the drive-in.without a doubt, the best late night television ever. if you didn't stay up, you were missing out.i know john bloom and joe bob live on, but i want them back where they belong...monstervision! question...did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of "the swarm" ? q:)long live monstervision!

i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993. i was 8 at the time, and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it.the 90's all of a sudden seem so far away, what a great decade. anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time, as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films. it was like the 90's version of chiller theater. if mst3k can get dvd's why not joe bob's show, at least monstervision was more interesting and informative. a lot of joe bob's comments and info on the films were just hilarious. most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen. many were oddball flicks that you wouldn't see anywhere else like the the japanese sci-fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell. with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors, i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up, since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show. i'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day, i guess will have to wait and see. until then "thats great television"!

it's cheesy, it's creepy, it's gross, but that's what makes it so much fun. it's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable. this movie is great to make fun of. rent it for a good laugh.the film centers around three women newscasters, during a time way before cellphones. they go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't get a room to stay the night. and that's when they meet ernest keller. he's creepy in a psycho kind of way. and he offers to let them stay at his home. but he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there.stephen furst's performance is so amazing as "the unseen", that he really carries this film. most of the movie is kind of dull, although finding out the truth of ernest's family is kind of interesting. just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look. barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy. i consider the movie an old gem, hard to find and worth a look.

this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick ("carrie" and others) and barbara bach. it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it. this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. it seems that 3 young newswomen (karen, vicky, and jennifer) travel to the small city of solvang, california to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller (lassick) and his strange wife virginia. vickie stays behind, feeling ill, as the other 2 are off to film their story. she is soon murdered at the house, in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement). soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover. jennifer is fighting with her (ex?)lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to murder her as well. virgina does not totally agree with earnest's plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior. here the film turns almost comic as junior (portrayed hysterically by stephen furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient, manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done. the actors/actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick, furst, and bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining!

three girls (an all-female media-crew, including cult-actress barbara bach, no less) visiting a small town to cover a festival, end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague. well-made little shocker, suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue-scenes and a rather thin plot-line (that doesn't do very well in hiding its secrets). one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock-material), and this is basically what the film thrives on. performances & cinematography are pretty much above par (compared to many other late 70's/early 80's films in the same vein), but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax-scene in the basement-setting. from the moment that "keller junior" character was introduced, his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close until the end of the film. a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick (who was funnily wacko in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest", and now utterly demented in "the unseen") take on one of the leading roles.

the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show. the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable. the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the movie worth watching. the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. i rated it an 8 out of 10.

it's true that danny steinmann's "the unseen" is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot, no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single cliché the genre has brought forward over the decades, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. on the contrary, my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting. the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival, but their hotel forgot to register their booking. in their search for a place to stay, the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion. one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house. "the unseen" can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics "psycho" and "the texas chainsaw massacre". the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films, like twisted family secrets in the cellar, voyeurism, crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens. still, i don't consider these to be negative remarks, as "the unseen" is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade. although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast, director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house "unseen" like the title promised. the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre. sydney lassick, immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller. his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed. also stephen furst, who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen, gives away a tremendous performance as "junior". he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving. "the unseen" is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70's exploitation and generally weird stuff.

gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast, a television reporter who travels with her crew (karen lamm and lois young) to solvang, california, to cover a danish festival. the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full. so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller (a phenomenal sydney lassick). wouldn't you know it, ernest and meek partner virginia (lelia goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their cellar: pitiable, deformed, diaper-clad "junior" (stephen furst, in a remarkable performance) who ultimately terrorizes the girls.a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax, delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour. the hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of "psycho" here - are great settings. most of all, the perverse plot involves incest and patricide, allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality. and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls. the final shot is especially sad."the unseen" is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery.8/10

get this film if at all possible. you will find a really good performance by barbara bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by  "the unseen". i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach, whom i'd just viewed in "the spy who loved me." i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. so: we start with a nice fresh premise. tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town, solvang, that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. she brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (the late karen lamm plays bach's sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching bach (mrs. ringo starr) and lamm (mrs. dennis wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) anyway  bach's disgruntled beau follows her to solvang, as he's not done arguing with her. there's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (maybe to bach's boyfriend, because think of it  where's he gonna stay?). the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor mr. keller (the late sidney lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home, insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. oh no! next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife, warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along. trouble in paradise! the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes, but one of the girls doesn't feel good. bach and lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about mrs. keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. speaking of which  under-the-weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. she hears him, thinks he's come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn't get a long enough look. after he's left, poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening round of action) by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  the unseen! lamm comes home next (bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and can't find anyone in the house. she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting the unseen again! well, at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into mr. keller's past and get the full story of what his sick, sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much. bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. meanwhile, lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can't let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.i cannot say enough for stephen furst, whom i'd never seen before; it's obvious that he did his homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; bach and goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie luster. not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. no stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners... a real treat for your collection.

los angeles tv news reporter jennifer (the beautiful barbara bach of "the spy who loved me" fame) and her two assistants karen (the appealingly spunky karen lamm) and vicki (the pretty lois young, who not only gets killed first, but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene) go to solvang, california to cover an annual danish festival. since all the local hotels are booked solid, the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky, but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky ernest keller (deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late, great sydney lassick) and his meek sister virginia (a solid lelia goldoni). unfortunately, keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement: a portly, pathetic, diapered, incest-spawned man-child mongoloid named junior (an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by stephen furst; flounder in "animal house"), who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc. capably directed by danny steinmann, with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast, a compellingly perverse plot, excellent make-up by craig reardon, a nicely creepy atmosphere, a wonderfully wild climax, a slow, but steady pace, likable well-drawn characters, and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame (the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch), this unjustly overlooked early 80's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out.

simply put, this is the best movie to come out of michigan since... well, ever! evil dead eat your heart out, hatred of a minute was some of the oddest, and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time. i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip, or a good case of the willies!

"hatred of a minute" is a hauntingly beautiful film. a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, eric seaver. strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a "must see" for any film student or horror fan. the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies. some shout outs to the film's producer, bruce campbell as well as to the film "the evil dead" add some humor for anyone that knows the genre.

michael kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as eric seaver, a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous, abusive, alcoholic stepfather barry (a genuinely frightening portrayal by gunnar hansen). eric has a compassionate fiancé (sweetly played by the lovely tracee newberry) and a job transcribing autopsy reports at a local morgue. haunted by his bleak past, egged on by the bald, beaming jack the demon (a truly creepy michael robert brandon), and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother, eric goes off the deep end and embarks on a brutal killing spree. capably directed by kallio (who also wrote the tight, astute script), with uniformly fine acting by a sound no-name cast (jeff steiger is especially good as eric's wannabe helpful guardian angel michael), rather rough, but overall polished cinematography by george lieber, believable true-to-life characters, jolting outbursts of raw, shocking and unflinchingly ferocious violence, a moody, spooky score by dan kolton, an uncompromisingly downbeat ending, grungy detroit, michigan locations, a grimly serious tone, and a taut, gripping narrative that stays on a steady track throughout, this extremely potent and gritty psychological horror thriller makes for often absorbing and disturbing viewing. a real sleeper.

i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews. the movie is not great, but it has a lot of great elements. the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great. the story is slow and weak, but entertaining. the acting is bad, but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel. the music is pretty good and the gore is good. it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell. i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable, it was still enjoyable. the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy. the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up. there was no sex scenes. i gave it 7 out of 10 and i think that is fair. i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do. the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film, the devil is quite creepy.

"hatred of a minute" is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years. not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means, but it's definitely worth a watch. "hatred" chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver (played by director kallio), a formerly abused child now grown up, and starting to listen to his evil side. "hatred" is very nice visually. the shots are creative, and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at. this film actually has an element of production value to it, unlike other recent michigan releases like "dark tomorrow" and "biker zombies." subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's $350,000 budget. however, "hatred" stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do, and that's in the story and character department. essentially, things just kind-of happen. eric seaver doesn't evolve at all. basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development. also, the ending is very abrupt. however- since this is a horror film, since when do we care about plot? we just want to see people die, and "hatred" certainly delivers. as the body count mounted, people in the theater started cheering "kill her! kill em' all!" when people scream back at the screen, it's always fun. that's the place where "hatred" succeeds. it's fun. and in the end, that's all that really matters.

this is a decent little flick made in michigan, about a guy that is haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (gunnar hansen) and has grown up not-so-well-adjusted. in fact, he's absolutely bonkers, but tries not to be too obvious. he's got an entourage too, his own little demon & angel that follow him around. the demon never says a word but really, doesn't have to, and he's max schreck-creepy. let's just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this, as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" people that he decides need it, mostly beautiful young women. this is a decent portrayal of madness, and you're kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what's going on, but overall, i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest. it's a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on. a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks.

so what constitutes a real independent film? in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge, i'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy.which is why we should be glad that films like "hatred of a minute" exist. across the board, this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template (indie horror film). love it or hate it, "hatred" isn't afraid of being what it is, and in watching this film, you get the real sense that kallio (the director) didn't just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place, he's in this to tell stories. good ones. you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store, but don't be fooled, this story is also about love, about good people pushed over the edge, and that oh-so-distant light at the end of the tunnel.if you expect smut, or an evil dead ripoff, stay away from this film. but if you dig the finer points of the horror/suspense genres, check this film out.yes. bruce campbell did produce this movie, and i'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not "evil dead". bruce has never tried to bank on his "ash" image, and it's obvious that he didn't get involved with "hatred" so that it could do so either.my advice, though, to all dead-ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr. campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr. kallio and mr. campbell are trying to show you.the acting is well done, although nothing about this film is oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film. so often, actors in films such as these don't even seem to try, with "hatred", it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously, never resorting to typical horror-film campiness.technically, "hatred" is about as competent as indie film gets. the editing is fast paced, the cinematography is good given the budget, and "hatred" keeps a quick pace, without any bog-down points or bad anti-climaxes.all in all, hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi-million dollar fake indies, but personally, i don't see a problem with that. it's a film by folks who actually care about the medium. people who reached into thier broke ass pockets, pulled out thier nickles and dimes, threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie.check this one out.

despite the occasionally stilted acting and "seen-it-all-before" story, this is a fairly compelling movie.it has suspense, the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy, some of the visual effects are superb and best of all, no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film, as too many (wannabe) horror films have in them nowhonestly, this isn't the greatest film ever made, but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character developmenti was glad i watched it

michigan, edgar allen poe, a toaster, and a frying pan . . . if you don't mind the psycho-thriller or horror film genre, and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted, this is the movie for you. an amazingly well developed first film, "hatred of a minute" has all the draw of mainstream hits like "silence of the lambs" and of cult classics like "army of darkness." the editing and effects are well done, better than many films in the genre. kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and poe's writings. at a time when big budget, big name films lack much in the way of substance, the independent film has resurrected this dying trait. if you love michigan, a good story, or a decent thriller go check out "hatred of a minute."

i can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film. it was truly a lot of fun. the special effects were wonderful. i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters, but not this time. i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn't enjoy the film. i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. blair witch and the mummy. both films that i thought were terrible. blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. people liked it for it's special effects. films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse rides. well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting's e-ticket.

what can i say that hasn't been said about "the haunting"? it has everything that would make a great picture. wonderful sets, moody music, and sound design to die for were all in place. the screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way. the entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was. each member of the cast gives a worthy performance, although with little conviction to the material at hand. lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her. but that's about it. all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours, but you will definitely want more. a lot more.

what can i say about it?it's another hollywood's horror flick with very high budget(80 million dollars).not scary at all,it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace.a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more.catherine zeta-jones is beautiful as always,lili taylor is also a good actress.the architecture of the hill house is amazing,all these monuments,statues,furniture...delicious!however i don't like the ending because it was so luscious.check this one out and form your own opinion on it.i give this picture 7 out of 10.

i rented this movie this past weekend, cranked up the surround sound system, and got some great sound from special affects. this movie is a great movie rental, the special affects where enough to scare my fiance, but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated. i didn't go to the movies and see this, but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie. i would recommend it!

some films just simply should not be remade. this is one of them. in and of itself it is not a bad film. but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. liam neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of owen wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke. but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.

i don't know why the critics trashed this movie. i hardly ever agree with them anyway.the movie could have been a little scarier - i don't usually go to horror movies! i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. i needn't have bothered! ;) (the cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;) ... liam was great as always. i also liked catharine zeta jones (theo) and lili taylor (eleanor-nell)the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. the special and sound effects were awesome. i also loved the music score, particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power, peace and freedom.

i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 haunting as well as most of the hammer films. this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. i have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. the old haunting was also a fine film from 1963. it was even more scary. see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin.

the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. there are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past, i found interesting. there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. jerry goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. what i wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. jan de bont had a pg-13 rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much. poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. the haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. the ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. overall, i enjoyed it. the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. i just wish it scared me more.

now, many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title. if you do not have the stomach for gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? anyhow, i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately. this movie is chock full of wonderful gore, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience! if you're a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, watch this great flick!

no, this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance, but it is brilliant in its own right. you have to look at it for what it is, a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride. those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden "gem" as they say and just didn't quite get there. i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the "5 cent baby attached to a fish pole" hahaha, well, yes. i don't think a movie with a budget like this could afford "good" actors or effects so they worked with what they had. the guts and entrails were actually very convincing. the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall, this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn't follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.

well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen. the effects are so bad you just have to laugh, and the acting, well lets say its no mel gibson. but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad, he becomes good. i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10. you must see it if your in to horror/slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time. killer movie.

why does this have such a low rating? i really don't get it... is it because of the bad acting? the bad dialogue? well, who cares about these things in cheesy low-budget horror movies? seriously, the acting and the dialogue isn't important in those movies. people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn't be allowed to rate cheesy low-budget movies. those movies shouldn't be taken seriously. period.anyway, time to talk about the movie, right? well, i loved it! i bought it because i expected a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad (most of the time it's just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that's lame), but i didn't really care because the movie is hilarious! the characters are hilarious, the acting is hilarious (bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies), the dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies), the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious, the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on, but i don't want to say too much... but i have to mention that there's a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it's alive lol! oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol!best lines in the movie:detective manners: *sniffs coke* detective sloane: what the *beep* are you doing, manners? what the hell did you snort? what the hell is that? detective manners: it's nothing man, it's... ehh... cold medicine...detective manners: *injects heroin in his arm* detective sloane: what the *beep* are you doing, manners? are you *beep* insane? detective manners: it's cold medicine.detective manners: *repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face* detective sloane: what the hell's going on, manners? what are you doing? detective manners: this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock! he just started smashing his head on the rock! i think he's on pcp or something!lol!

sure this movie wasn't like. 16 blocks, inside man, an american haunting. etc...but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us.. i found this movie really great and scary.i live exactly where they filmed this movie "san pedro, california" and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie.i dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach "queen mary" well that boat is haunted. i believe in spirts, illusions, and parallel or however u spell that. is real. everybody's in there own universe.and the mind is a powerful thing.i recommend to watch this movie. it's great, and not bad directing at all.for those who rate it a 1. they don't understand the film. its meaning. its plot, its view. and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us.ty.victor

i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating, because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds. as a matter of fact, they didn't - at least, so its seems. some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie - that's it, this is what the majority of viewers think. however, the surprise comes at the end, and unfortunately then, when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie. i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian-portuguese title of this movie means "voyage into death". this is the spoiler.that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat (on reasons that are completely unclear), you understand only in the last 5 minutes. when you start the movie with the english title "haunted boat" in your head, you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the "ghosts". but in reality, this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer-watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality, it is told from the perspective of the young girl. we see her not alone, but together with the four friends because she sees them. we do not see that she is alone. so, the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture-stream, but the main story! we have at least two parallel worlds: the world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are. an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat.i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie, the movie-makers "cheated" an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film-student elaborate with hastily "chosen" pseudo-actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers. how mistaken can one be! but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes, the end that follows gives another surprise. the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat. when she has recovered from her shock, she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends. and there they are again! they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore. she jumps into the water, arrives at the boat - and they are away. miraculously beautiful. it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer: when i awoke, i saw death standing at my bed. but i closed my eyes. when i opened them again - he was gone.

i must admit, i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of 'cut' last night, though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem. i am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found 'cut' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody/comedy films of late.my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could. i am certain this was intended as humour....hoping this was intended as humour.and of course, there was the gore.the use of the 'customised' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. in short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth.the appearance of both kylie minogue (short that her appearance was) and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as simon bossell ('the castle') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician.all in all, i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end.loved it. go see it!

australia's first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang. and a stab. and a slice. and a scream or two. and plenty of blood, frights, red herrings and lots of laughs.in fact, there's lots of first surrounding cut - it's the first script of dave warner's to be produced, although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation; it's the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall; and it's also the first film for producer martin fabinyi. and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time, they sure know their stuff.cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film, hot blooded, that was never finished because its director, hilary (kylie minogue), was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film.despite their lecturer (who was assistant director on the night hilary died) warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies, director raffy (jessica napier) and producer hester (sarah kants) decide to go ahead and complete the film. they put together a crew and manage to get the original star, vanessa turnbill (molly ringwald), to return to australia - in fact, to the original location - to complete hot blooded  14 years after shooting shut down.of course, this being a slasher film, lots of bloodletting ensues  long with plenty of laughs, a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack. cut shows that australia can make a good, mass-market horror film just as well as hollywood.it's a finely crafted feature, with excellent special effects, a taut plot and a killer - scarman - that's a welcome addition to the ranks of michael, jason and freddy.

i was really excited about seeing this film. i thought finally australia had made a good film.. but i was wrong.this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever. i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie.the acting was terrible (especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent), and the plot was also pretty bad.when i first heard about this film coming out, i thought that the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheesy film "stab" in scream 2), but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie.warning!!! major spoilers!!!probably the worst thing about the film was the ending. i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was.. but the killer wasn't even human.. which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie.don't see this film.. you'll probably be disappointed!

i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously, basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job.. there seems to be another movie coming out like that too, umm... scary movie?? well this is aussie, and original!!! jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting! i hope to see more of them. molly ringwald was a good move, and kylie was an even better move. the impossible princess was queen of the screen!! i recommend seeing this flick, as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy, hilary and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago.

personally, i enjoyed cut thouroughly. it was the first time i've seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick. a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films.with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything. i didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies. it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street, not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief. i think it's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres.cut was original, scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun. i'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious. it did what i expected it to do, entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying. i enjoyed it.

i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it, which was sometime last year. anyway i got to see today, and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so. i thought that the movie was pretty good. but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created, i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends: final cut, i almost died it. mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved. cut is 100 times better than ul:final cut. the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes. the killer kicks mo f***ing ass.i give cut a 8 out of 10

it isn't the worst film ever made, the actors aren't apalling and the script and director are not completely inept. it isn't the best film ever made, the actors aren't excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant.it falls somewhere in the middle. a fun somewhere. an enjoyable, well constructed somewhere.no need to say "don't take it seriously" or "so bad its good" or "it wasn't scary". none of these comments are relevant. cut has atmosphere. it's that atmosphere which is actually very unique, and the one really original aspect of the movie, which personally is what makes the film, for me.

"cut" is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do. most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the old creepy house, the woods, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of gore, and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex (that's hardly a spoiler).the set-up is simplicity itself: film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher "masterpiece", unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast. this also neatly - okay, messily - disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel. they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines. the rest of the cast fit their roles well, especially the lovely jessica napier, who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her.there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments, and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace. it also has an appropriate low budget look, including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate. good soundtrack, too. if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre. probably a bit of both.

this is not a bad movie. it follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is the movie within a movie, the well known actress running for her life in the first scene. this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose, and manage to do something new, and interesting with it. it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack.so this might be an example of what the genre has become. cut hits all the marks, and is actually scary in some parts. i liked it i gave it an eight.

this is surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. all the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy. the finale was really cool, as i loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well, plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable!. it's decently made and written, and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. this killer didn't mess around, and i loved it, and slasher fans(like myself) should really enjoy this film, plus the opening was really wicked too, with them filming the movie!. this is a surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and i say it's well worth the watch!. the direction is good. kimble rendall does a good! job here with solid camera work, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. the acting is solid!. molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and i had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, i'm surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!. frank roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, creepy and had one hell of a mask, and this guy didn't mess around, he was fantastic!. kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine. rest of the cast are fine. overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5

for a slasher flick,this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre.yes it is predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree,people die,yada yada yada.however there are some good positives in this film.first off,i really liked the mask the nut job wore.it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique(although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made)also,the genesis of the bad due is something i haven't seen before,and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept,as far as i know.i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko,for most of the murders.the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre,but that'a small concern.the movie does not take itself seriously,which is something most slashers suffer from.oddly enough,while watching the movie,i was reminded of the early "friday the 13th films,which did take themselves seriously.there are a few concerns about this movie.in several scenes,the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons.by this,i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot,and also the way he walked.of bigger concern,however is a scene very close to the end,where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance(actually a complete rip off)of another famous horror titan.and in the very last scenes,we have our scumbag,once again,looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned.in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon in the slasher genre. these scenes were weak and unoriginal(obviously).by the way,the movie is set in australia,so if you're a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent(like me)you'll be in heaven.if you not,than it just might grate on you.one other great thing about this movie:beautiful kylie minogoue(just don't get too attached to her)there is one non aussie accent,courtesy of molly ringwald.overall,there are more reasons to watch than not.i enjoyed it and had some fun.so,i have to give "cut" 8/10,which may seem too high to some people.

twelve years ago, production stopped on the slasher flick "hot blooded" since almost everyone on the set started dying. now, a couple of film students have decided to finish the film, despite the fact that there's a rumor that the film is cursed. well, they're about to find out that some curses are real.when scream was released, every country seemed to want to cash in on its success, even australia. the concept, which today has been done to death (a slasher film within a slasher film) was at the time relatively cool and original. this movie was released right before urban legends: final cut and scream 3 (well not in the us but in australia) so it felt like the first movie with this concept. when urban legends 2 was released, most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn't even good, the movie flopped disastrously. now, cut is not the best slasher flick ever, and nor does it try to be. it knows that it's a rip-off, and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role. but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story, they've decided to rip-off some 80s slasher flicks like "nightmare on elm street" as well and surprisingly enough, this actually works. the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer! and instead of trying to scare the audience to death, they've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie. there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn't able to fully ignore, the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie. spoiler ahead; i mean, they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene? it makes no sense i tell you. end of spoilers. all in all, cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip-offs that never made it big. i'm surprised that this one never got a sequel, but i guess it simply came out too late. suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares. cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it's completely ludicrous.

when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure-type movies, the first thing i think of are '80s slasher flicks. really bad slasher flicks. the formulaic type of film, where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made.flash forward to the late '90s/early '00s. the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996's "scream". like in the '80s, these films were formulaic, masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as "hip, tongue-in-cheek parodies" of the original slasher flicks. of this recent blend of "hip parody" neo-slasher flicks, the only one worth seeing is the low-budget, direct-to-video "cut".like most of the other "new" slasher flicks, "cut" relies on the production of a slasher flick, in this case a fictional 1985 film "hot blooded", to make its commentary on the genre. "hot blooded" never finished production, because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer, scarman, a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark, pupil-less eyes. now, 12 years later, a group of film students, whose professor was involved in the production, have decided to go into the vaults, tap the original surviving actress, and finish the film. but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot, "scarman" returns and someone dies. to quote the tagline, will they finish the film before it finishes them?this all sounds really bad, and to a degree it is (really, is there such a thing as a good slasher flick?). there is no character development (the "new" director is revealed to be the daughter of "hot blooded"'s original director, whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled; this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot, yet it's never mentioned again) and, like in all other slasher flicks, there are just too many bodies to care about. the actors aren't great, even by direct-to-video standards, but most are having fun with their characters (and for those who aren't, it's inadvertent character acting, since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on "hot blooded"), particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman. "cut"'s climax has no big "who dunnit" unmasking of the killer like in the "scream" films. it doesn't have the gimmick killings of the "urban legend" films. what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a "this way we can write a sequel if it sells well" ending. but that's par for the course.by any sensible viewing standards, this is a horrible movie that should be avoided, but this "quality" is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre, and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo-slasher flicks.

a horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well. it's about a masked killer. the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew. he goes crazy and kills two people. he's killed himself and the film is never finished. twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it--but there's a curse. people who try and finish it are killed themselves. the students ignore that. guess what happens next?the plot is old hat but this isn't bad...for what it is (a low budget slasher film). it's well-made with a young and fairly talented young cast. no one is great but no one is terrible either. it also avoids the obligatory (and needless) female nude scenes. it moves quickly, the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence. also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress.no great shakes but not bad at all. i give it a 7.

eric valette is obviously a talented film-maker, and so are the two guys who wrote the script. therefore maléfique is a great flick, made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination. well, i'm a bit exaggerating, but nevertheless i'm sincere. so, if you like dark, gory movies, go and see this one. it's really worth it.

four prisoners share a single cell: the domineering transvestite, marcus (clovis cornillac); marcus's idiot savant buddy, paquerette (dimitri rataud), who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches, cockroaches, and his little sister; lassalle (philippe laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and carrère (gérald laroche), the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping. after a brick falls from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden journal written by a 'fountain of youth'-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. is this journal the secret to their escape? or is there something much more sinister behind it?i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call (2008), which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i've ever seen. however, much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan's awful script, because (as i remember) valette's direction wasn't the worst part about the film (unless he chose to include the baby). anyway, maléfique was a good way to get my respect back. . . it's a french film (obviously something i like) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums). so that's two points for him before the film even starts. luckily, valette had me once the film ended as well. maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, rather compelling story of obsession and desperation. . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality. while it's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense, the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening. the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i've seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore.final verdict: 8.5/10. quite a bit of respect earned back by valette.note: paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake (surprise surprise). it's due out in 2009. i'm not sure why, to be honest, as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states. but, i've been surprised before.vive la france! -ap3-

a prison cell.four prisoners-carrere,a young company director accused of fraud,35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation, daisy,a 20 year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and lassalle,a 60 year-old intellectual who murdered his wife.behind a stone slab in the cell,mysteriously pulled loose,they discovered a book:the diary of a former prisoner,danvers,who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century.the diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape."malefique" is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films i have seen this year.the film has a grimy,shadowy feel influenced by the works of h.p. lovecraft,which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere.there is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed.it's a shame that eric valette made truly horrible remake of "one missed call" after his stunning debut.9 out of 10.

now, i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft (and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school, maybe as a separate subject), but how did they think something that sounds like "ftagn yog sototh" could possibly lead to any good?the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may, if read right, get them out. as prisons go, the cell was totally unrealistic, so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things. it also moves rather slowly, which may bore people. but other than that, this is top notch horror feeling, mixing sartre's "hell is other people" with a lovecraft/barker type of story, and doing rather successfully.bottom line: take the time to watch this. that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else. this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it. lessons to be learned: yog is bad, almost as bad as french women.

i was hooked from beginning to end. great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump, but to make you go "what the f*ck did i just see?" all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about, so i won't rehash what has already been said. i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me. i even had a bad dream after seeing it, and i am a true horror fan, not easily spooked by tripe like "the grudge" or even "silent hill". what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys. what would my personal horror be? my subconscious took me there, and it was not pleasant. that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you! the best part of this movie is that it is subtle. it's not about bogeymen that jump out at you,alien invasions, or tons of gore. it's the opposite. the horror you create in your own mind. the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it's power over them. simply, the men ask for the one thing they desire, and they get it...but not in the way they imagined. so on the one hand, they get what they wish for from an occult book, but may ultimately wish they hadn't. sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be!

now this is what i'd call a good horror. with occult/supernatural undertones, this nice low-budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene. this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie.the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) become gradually more interesting, as the movie builds up tension to the finale. most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere, who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates.i won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen. there a few flaws though: the fx are not that good, but they're used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confusing towards the end, but malefique redeems itself by the time it's over.i thought his was a very good movie, 8/10

watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it. the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. as they look through the diary, they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom. what they find out, is something completely different, and horrifying to say the least. i like low-budget horror films, that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way, and tell a good story. this movie does just that, despite taking a while to get going. the result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me, and i enjoyed the ride. not a lot of gore, but that wouldn't fit the story, although the gore it has is pretty good.

this film centers on four criminals, locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell, hoping that a mysterious book of black magic, penned by a former inmate around 1920, named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young.carrère's(gérald laroche)criminal business tactics(shortcuts)have landed him in prison with three oddball cell-mates..a transsexual brute marcus(clovis cornillac), marcus' love-toy pâquerette(dimitri rataud)who eats objects he touches(..and is in prison for eating his six-month old sister)and obeys his charge as if "he" were his mother, and the scholarly lassalle(philippe laudenbach)who doesn't read, or eat breakfast(..the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day). the film follows carrère as he reads from the book, attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison. carrère loves his child, and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail. when she betrays him, carrère begins to slowly seethe with hate, and longing to see and hold his beloved son. carrère's toughest critic is marcus, who longs to be fully female, while still folding to several masculine traits, such as working out and taking a leak standing up. he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic, although deep inside is a world of vulnerability. pâquerette is completely under marcus' control and behaves like a canine to it's master..there's even an alarming scene where pâquerette breast-feeds from marcus! lassalle is an unraveling mystery, opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain. clearly intellectual, and holding possible secrets from the others, lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going. soon, those who aren't a threat to the book seek their "true" escape, not as much from the cell of four walls, but the cell that imprisons their true desires. after a certain murder, the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant..who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away, and better yet, how to use it? a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach.i'm glad i had a chance to watch this film. it does play out like "monkey's paw", the characters get what they desire, but a price must be met. there's gore in the film, startling moments of graphic violence, but, in my opinion, this is first and foremost a story-driven tale. the gore is a product of what the book unleashes. one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air, while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire. we see danver's fate at the end, with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away. lassalle's fate is a masterful effects sequence. i will say that maléfique, through eric valette's well paced direction, always kept my attention, and, for being such an isolated movie(..about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location, the prison cell)it never seems to drag. i guess that's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations, not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them.

in a penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell: carrère (gérald laroche), who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the drag lassalle (philippe laudenbach) and his protégée, the retarded pâquerette (dimitri rataud), who ate his six months sister; and the intellectual marcus (clovis cornillac), who killed his wife. one night, carrère finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. they realize that the book was written by danvers (geoffrey carey) in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. they decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison, when they find the truth about danvers' fate. "maléfique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic french low-budget horror movie. the story is practically in the same location, does not have any clichés and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. i am a great fan of french cinema, usually romances, dramas and police stories, but i noted that recently i have seen some good french horror movies, such as "un jeu d' enfants", "belphegor" and "dead end". my vote is seven.title (brazil): "sinais do mal" ("signs of the evil")

malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere. nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest. soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell. from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison. that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light.honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together. anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast. the kills are raw and eerie... its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser. malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint. at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger... when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal, so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be? with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do. i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale. several elements like the visitor with the camera, the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story. anyway, i'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette, although its a turn-off to see he's is doing a hollywood remake of "one missed call" which was worn off and useless already in the miike-version.

good horror movies from france are quite rare, and it's fairly easy to see why! whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film, he emigrates towards glorious hollywood immediately after to directed the big-budgeted remake of another great film classic! how can france possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy-directors leave the country after just one film? "haute tension" was a fantastic movie and it earned director alexandre aja a (one-way?) ticket to the states to remake "the hills have eyes" (which he did terrifically, i may add). eric valette's long-feature debut "maléfique" was a very promising and engaging horror picture too, and he's already off to the hollywood as well to direct the remake of takashi miike's ghost-story hit "one missed call". so there you have it, two very gifted frenchmen that aren't likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon. "maléfique" is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start, but once the plot properly develops, it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects. the film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters. we're inside a ramshackle french prison cell with four occupants. the new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud, the elderly and "wise" inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there's a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome. they find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell, belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920's who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape. the four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book, only to realize the occult is something you shouldn't mess with eric valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists, which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots, but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of wishmaster-device. "maléfique" is a dark film, with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior. watch it before some wealthy american production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals.

french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene. maléfique preceded the revival just slightly, but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made! maléfique was obviously shot on a low budget, but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film, and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner. the plot focuses on two main ideas; prison and black magic. the central character is a man named carrère, sent to prison for fraud. he is put in a cell with three others; the quietly insane lassalle, body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy. after a short while in the cell together, they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal. after translating part of it, they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls.black magic is a very interesting topic, and i'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it. it's fair to say that maléfique makes the best of it's assets as despite it's restraints, the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout. director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film; the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic, and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell - it's very easy to get behind them! it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people, and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner, and this helps to ensure that maléfique actually does manage to be quite frightening! the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot; the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done. anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying! overall, maléfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade - highly recommended viewing!

maléfique is a very interesting movie. it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures. the central concept is great, three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth (who the audience identify with) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell.the atmosphere is well-woven, it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes' in the château d'if (prior to becoming the count of monte cristo). the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell, particularly the character we are meant to identify with (carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it's obliquely suggested might be fraud). on one occasion carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him; we never leave the cell, the claustrophobia is unbroken. there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell, and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall. so even though the film appears to be very modern, it has a very old world feel of incarceration.the characters are intriguing. we have marcus, a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pâquerette (french for daisy) a heavily retarded young man. pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful, and unfortunately this included his baby sister, hence his current predicament (i like this comment on internalisation, very primitive). lasalle is a withdrawn, possessed elderly man, in for brutally murdering his wife.the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you, and there's a ritual that goes with that. i think that's what disturbs me the most, seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically. it has a real life ring to it. the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well, every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong. i'm actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self-destructive.i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently, particularly with carrère, also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film, not in terms of a successive revelation either. i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more by design than execution, such as the famous "vagina eye", and the sodomy of lasalle, for me, totally hollow images.at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with, and some things don't seem logical, for example we've been clumsily led to believe different things about carrère's child. this doesn't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird, a "pure" horror movie. there is no comedic dross or genre segueing, like cube (1997/natali), the obvious movie to compare it to, it's a total immersion experience, where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters. this last comment i make about it being a "pure" experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point.on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge. this prompts lasalle to go insane. that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge. it's something i myself have felt.one final comment is that two of the quite well-received comments on the board have confused the characters' names. to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character, simply click on philippe laudenbach's page and you will see he was born in 1936.

i'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england, but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it. there are a lot of great things to the film, for a start the acting. its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work. this and the constantly gripping and interesting script, with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it, give the film a real solid backbone. add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner. it has my favorite kind of gore too, supernatural and splattery. also, the characters of marcus, the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy, his mentally retarded lover/plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times, and give a far out, anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones. this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies, far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce. my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone, but it still works, so on the whole i'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs.

i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless. it is original, although reminded me a little of two other french films, vidocq and city of lost children, mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters.set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off, this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster.always interesting, with the perennial 'black arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable! scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing.

if you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'book of the dead', 'book of eibon' or 'necronomicon', then you should feel right at home with malefique, a film which also features an occult tome, one with the power to change the destinies of all involved. discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell, the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by danvers, a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished. finders of the book are carrère (gérald laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife, lassalle (philippe laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan, the halfwit pâquerette (dimitri rataud) who once ate his baby sister, and the 'librarian' marcus (clovis cornillac), supposedly driven mad by reading, who murdered his wife. reminding the viewer of meat loaf's equally bizarre, bosomy male in fight club (1999), lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet, one who is especially protective of the infantile pâquerette. with the coming of the book however, and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents, marcus assumes greater and greater significance. at first assured of an early bail, meanwhile carrère takes little more than academic interest in events. suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and, as the prisoners experiment, danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers...staged for the most part within a prison cell, and between four or five characters, malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter (as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers). only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell, a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed, closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere. more than anything, this is a film about being trapped, either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. "i'm going to escape," says carrère at the start of the film, wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son. whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price, and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine.with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director eric vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does. as critics have noticed, it is a film with strong freudian overtones - lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus; danvers' original placenta fetish; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited, etc. with so many interesting aspects to the script vallette hardly puts a foot wrong, and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what, when one comes down to it, is just a matter of four guys, four bunks, one folding table and a book. there's a genuine, growing, lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages, while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina, or what ultimately happens to pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable. the pacing of many of the dark events in malefique is deliberate, rejecting the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions: a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore. perhaps this is a particularly european manner, as one recalls a similar, measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as verhoeven's the fourth man (1983) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye.lensed well in 1.85:1, malefique benefits from excellent performances and, if for this viewer at least, the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been, the journey to the final shot was worth taking. coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received haute tension (aka: switchblade romance, 2003), this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the french industry, this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia

well, magic works in mysterious ways. this movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense. even if it had something of a theater-play (almost everything happens in the cell) it never got boring and it was acted very well. in the tradition of "cube" you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal, you developed some sympathy with some of them, only to change your mind by the twists the story takes. some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air. altogether intense and entertaining and as i didn't expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!

"maléfique" is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart. its cast doesn't have recognized names, it doesn't have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect; but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well-written script, an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills. eric valette may not be a well-know name yet, but with "maléfique", his feature length debut, he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet, gans or aja.the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell, four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal: to get out. carrère (gérald laroche) gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi-millionaire fraud; his cell-mates, the violent marcus (clovis cornillac), the intellectual lassalle (philippe laudenbach) and the mentally challenged pâquerette (dimitri rataud), are all convicted for murder and give carrère a cold welcome. their personalities will clash as carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic.written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier, "maléfique" is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker's stories. the movie's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters, they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities. the story's supernatural element is very well-handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel. despite being a movie about four men locked in a room, the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact, the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust, claustrophobia, and specially, paranoia.director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere, mood and his cast to give life to the plot. despite its obvious lack of budget, he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original, fresh and very attractive. his subtle and effective camera-work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location, and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot. the very few displays of special effects are very well-done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore.the characters are what make this film work, and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit. gérald laroche is excellent as carrère, a man at first sight innocent, but who hides a dark past. philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too, specially rataud in his very demanding role. however, is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus, a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself. the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them.the movie is terrific, but it is not without its share of flaws. of course, the most notorious one is its the low-budget. some of the cgi-effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make-up and prosthetics used in other scenes, however, it is never too bad for it. probably the bad thing about "maléfique" is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters, not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view.anyways, "maléfique" is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately, and one that deserves to have more recognition. valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest (albeit complex) tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities. personally, this film is a new favorite. 8/10

i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes. but if you liked princess bride and forest gump, you would like this movie. you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose. killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite. just my opinion. i'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french. so this film isn't for a world audience. and while i am not a trained film critic, i know what i like. i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie.

this is not "so bad that it is good," it is purely good! for those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) anyways, killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. it is the single most genius text in cinematic history. i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa. it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. i write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen. it can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now i'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. my comment ended a while ago. hopefully it works when i submit it now.

this is a great example of a good, dumb movie. no, it is not high art by any means. nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks. but so what! the killer tomatoes series (four movies and a cartoon series) are basically good-natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks.as the title suggests, this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france. in this case, professor gangrene (john astin's 3rd time in the role) has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france. steve lundquist returns as igor, a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true king of france. obviously he also plays the aforementioned l-l t k of f, happily skewering the french language.opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato (like the others, ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon) and his human allies. mark price, recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series, plays a thinly disguised version of himself, passing himself as "michael j fox" as a way to win the girl of his dreams. and angela visser is a dream as marie, gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis. oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career! another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell (now best known as the hapless title subject of "who wants to marry a millionaire?"). like co-creator john de bello, rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series.what can you say about jon de bello? not much, really, except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and, having done that, has apparently dropped into obscurity. john, if you ever see this, thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes.the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie. like return of the killer tomatoes, the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew. and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox. this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send-off to the series. okay, the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series (which was also quite clever), but cartoons just aren't the same.

horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination. we all know that killers like freddy, jason, michael and even leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day. most of us don't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains. and let's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them. this is where imagination wins out over fact. horror, and most films in general, requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow. this usually isn't a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c. scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville. but what i do have a problem digesting ( without wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this film. to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself, but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed. there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is. but the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done, suspenseful, blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough. if the film would have offered me a different killer, then i would actually be raving about it. this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film, but believe me, anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me.john cassevetes plays dr. sam cordell. he and his daughter jenny ( played beautifully by erin flannery ) have just recently moved to this small new england town. cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died. we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour. her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed. again, i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway. cassevetes, it has to be mentioned, is strange to say the least. cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental. there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities. it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent, but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug. thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy. casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan. he has a deceptive smile and a virile, commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice. but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene. he just has that slimy, disingenuous, phlegmatic, uneasy way about him. he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film. i guess that is a credit to the writers, the director and to cassevetes himself. there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get-go. the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry. there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see, something or someone is watching them. when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck, the young woman wanders into the shed, just to play a prank. once she is there, she is attacked. the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail. hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in. he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding in the corner, and then smacko, the guy gets it. it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note.also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces. tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place, he has another dream. toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother, a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen.throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time, the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped. this is my first feeble (and careful) attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement. it just didn't strike the right chord.the incubus is a well done film. it is tense, tight and even most of the performances are very well done. i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders. but when you get through all that was good in the film, you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth. and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones. 7 out of 10-- this could have been a nine. too bad.

shocking, well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces.small town doctor tries to discover who, or what, is committing a series of violent sexual murders.incubus is a tight mystery, with some horrific murder sequences, that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist. the murder scenes are intense and gory, so this isn't a film for the squeamish! the direction of john hough, along with a bizarre music score, combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film. it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well. nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight.the cast isn't bad either. the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town. also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter, helen hughes as the town historian, and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen.all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated.*** out of ****

when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud.this is not steven kings best work. i thought that his best work was the shining. i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking. as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick. i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius. making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool. people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all. don't expect something from a movie that it isn't. it still in a general area wasn't that good. i still recommend people to watch the movie

there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else. maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable. but as i keep watching it over and over again, it never gets old, and i never get bored. from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending, there is something insane, sad and scary at the same time, and it keeps ringing in your head: sometimes dead is better! i don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again. all you need to know is it starts from point a (the most perfect situation for a happy american family) and step by step drowns to point b (which is, believe me, the very end of all joy). the music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be. like i said, sometimes dead is better!

overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct. the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts. i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie (because i hadn't found out about the movie yet) but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal-mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected. overall i give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall making sense) and for its bad parts (large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies).

personally, i absolutely love this movie and novel(i read the book first and decided to see the movie). first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. the acting is also great and i love the cast. judd crandall (plays fred gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. there are also a few corny lines thrown in there (idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh. the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie. not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again, i recommend this 100% to any horror fan!!

ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; they're a main part of a wide variety of horror films.this one, has a lot of them.still, it's stephen king, one of the best masters of horror. this movie was really good, just too predictable. and what horror movie doesn't have stupid people? this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken. pet semetary i found to be creepy a little. the way everything is set up was really spooky, but not terrifying. for the most part, the acting was somewhat believable, the suspense wasn't that suspenseful, but the entertainment level is set at a major rank; my eyes were practically glued to the screen.all stephen king fans must see this movie, but as for anyone else, expect an okay thriller.

probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet. not surprising, since king himself wrote the screenplay. the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house. one of the other residents is jud, a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area. one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. the other is a path leading to the pet sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. soon enough, ellie creed's cat, church, is found dead. luckily, this happens while the family, with the exception of louis(the father), is away for thanksgiving. jud takes louis to another burial ground, beyond the pet sematary, where church is to be buried. later, louis is greeted(not so politely) by church. he's returned, appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in. maybe he was buried alive. maybe not. nothing more i can say without ruining the story.of all the king adaptions i've seen this would be the most terrifying. the characters are real and the situations are normal. mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film, due in part to the plot development. the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever. then, of course, we have the conclusion. easy to determine what's going to happen, but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments.overall, this is a good film and an excellent adaption. if you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then "pet sematary" is just what you're looking for. non horror fans will want to avoid this.

so often with stephen king adaptations, you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books. this really captures the heart of the book. maybe because they don't use large chunks of text straight from the book, but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story. a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage. dale midkiff and denise "tasha yar" crosby really act like his parents. there's a scene where louis is cuddling gage, and they are very natural together. fred gwynne is wonderful. he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody, and is wise and warm just like jud should be. (8 out of 10)

ok, first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was 9 years old. if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time, i´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-tv horror film with some well-made scenes. but when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts. this scared the hell out of me back then, especially those aforementioned zelda- scenes (and they still do). nowadays i´m kind of hooked to this film. i have to see this maybe once in a month, and on every new year´s eve i watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends. it´s like an appetizer for a good party! i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense. midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like, but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which "the creeds" underact. what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary, and i don´t mean the zombie stuff here. the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind. honestly, how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-tv one, but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there? alright i busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago, but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection. but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary! i really would love to know...and i don´t mean night of the living dead here...this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff.

*****spoilers herein*****what really scares you? killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?maybe. but those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child. "pet sematary" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.i've read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. i disagree. the acting is actually first rate for a film like this. maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. but the film's events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. this is the true horror of "pet sematary": it isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does. despite warning, or even past history.the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect. and the results are horrifying. in fact, when the film dives into slasher territory near the end, it's almost a letdown, although i believe it's perfectly logical how it got there.i am a true horror fan, and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. if you don't think so, see it again after you have children.

minor spoilerunderrated little stephen king shocker. it's not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination--even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better, there'd still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with. the old micmac burial ground, rachel's terminally ill sister, and the jacob-marley-an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent, and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed. but few horror movies really are perfect, and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock. `pet sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda. it's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's gratuitous--and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way `safer' horror movies never can. add to that one of fred gwynne's best performances and mary lambert's witty direction, and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie--even with the hokey ending. highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.

"pet sematary" succeeds on two major situations. first, it's a scary horror movie. those that just aren't produced in these days. second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. so if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan. probably, the best adaptation to any of king's novels. the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel, but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete horror/drama accomplishment. stephen king's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time. the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members. then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title "pet sematary" does not offers appiness!) a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere, now it turns very dark. the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and "pet sematary" proves it dramatically. the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. sadly enough, the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead. the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much, much worse. what will happened with the lives of our all american family? could pascow prevent this tragedy? what is it with the surreal nightmares? watch "pet sematary" to witness one of the most touching, emotional horror movies of recent times. you won't regret. the acting is very good although i didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father. he didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation. but that's just my opinion. denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble, tender mother. baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts. *shivers*. overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a feeling of desperation.something is for sure... i don't wanna be buried, in a pet sematary!!

making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is never a good idea. when people read the book, they automatically start making their own "mental movie" of who the characters look like, the places they exist in, how the situations progress. and everybody's mind's-eye opus is different, which is why when the 'real' movie finally comes out, you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up.all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is, and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see.there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king. when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (carrie, 'salem's lot, the dead zone), or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (kubrick's version of the shining; the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers). although it's not even close to being the perfect king adaptation, pet sematary has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book, that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. for that, we have music video-turned-film director mary lambert to thank, (she also directed siesta, not exactly a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list), working from a screenplay by the 'man-ster' himself, and probably one of his better ones.since the majority of you know the story, i won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. dr. louis creed (dale midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well, even if you haven't read the book, do the frickin' math. it is a king story, after all, so no mystery where this is headed. it's not so much the destination that counts here, but the spooky stops along the way. certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery, scream-inducing life here: rachel creed's (star trek's denise crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill, crippled sister; louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow (brad greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip into the "other" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. and that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse.good performances by all here, especially the late fred gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor, jud crandall, who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: "sometimes, dead is better."about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis's son, gage (miko hughes). knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this, lambert and crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, hughes at the time was just too damn cute to "sell" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie. this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up, though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged, (especially gwynne's death scene.)other than that, everything else is still about as good as it gets. carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i'm concerned; but sematary is right up there in the top five.still, will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story? not bloody likely...for now.

this is one of the creepiest, scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie ever! dr creed (louise) and his family moving in to new home with his wife (rachel), daughter (ellie) and little son (gage) everything seems normal until dr creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury,then he is haunted by the ghost know as victor takes him to the pet sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life.louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to ellie who worried about her cat that could be killed by lorry and then later on rachel tells louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister zelda who was really sick (as we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever!) the next day louis gets a call from jed saying there cat as been killed by lorry and jed take him to place where victor the ghost told him not to go! and bury the cat, his wife and kids have go to see their grandparents and louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see jed then jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too (as we seen other flashback).later on in the movie the family out having picnic, gage is playing with kite and gage say's i drop it", the wind blow the rod near the road where a lorry coming at fast past, gage is get closer to road, louis is rushing to get him, the most heartbreaking scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on floor or shivers will go down your back when you hear louis screams, soon he missing him so much, louis then buries gage in same place where is buried the cat. the scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life. this movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great! 10 out 10

i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out. and the "no fair" uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance.

"pet sematary" is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title. the story follows the creeds - an all american, middle-class family, who move into a house out in the country. the family consists of louis and rachel, and their two young children, ellie and their toddler son, gage. the house couldn't be better, and the family meets a strange but friendly old man, jud, who lives across the road. he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves. and just beyond there, lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power. when the family cat, church, is killed, louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough, soon after, church returns to life. but there's something evil about him now, he isn't the same cat he used to be. and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage, louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son... unfortunately, he gets more than he bargained for.having read stephen king's novel, i can say that the book is much better than the film. not to say the movie is bad, because it isn't - the book is just a little bit better. the real strength in this film lies in it's story, which is both bizarre but extremely original, something that king's stories are typically known for. the script is very well adapted from the story, and while it minorly differs in some aspects, it's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation. there are a few plot holes here and there, nothing major though. besides that, this movie is actually pretty scary, and it succeeds in it's intention to do so. there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film, and i'd have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel's sister zelda is the number one. honestly, that is one of the most disgusting, disturbing things i've ever seen in a horror film - it's not gory and bloody, it's just flat out sickening. one thing's for sure, that image won't leave your head anytime soon.the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there. this film is actually on the gory side, there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there, including the shocker of an ending. i really liked the way they ended the film, it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive, but it worked better that way with all things considered.overall, "pet sematary" is a good horror movie that i'd recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general. the story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too. one of the better stephen king adaptations i'd say. 7/10.

louis creed, a doctor from chicago, moves to a large house near a small town, since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine's. along with him, is his wife rachel and their two kids, ellie and gage,as well as ellie's cat, church. soon, they met their new neighbor,and old man named judd crandall.judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house(that is constantly a way used by big trucks) but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house. judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery, but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children, since she has traumas from her sister zelda's death.during the first week of the family in the new house, louis already has dead people to deal with: victor pascow, a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident, addresses his dying words to louis personally, even though the two men are strangers. on the night following pascow's death, louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow, who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not "go beyond, no matter how much you feel you need to." louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream, until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. anyway, he dismisses the dream. many strange things starts to happen and church, ellie's cat, dies while walking on the highway. louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church's death with ellie, but judd, sympathizing with him, jud takes louis to the pet cemetery, supposedly to bury church. but instead of stopping there, jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to "the real cemetery": an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac ('...indians...'). there louis buries the cat on jud's instruction, with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life. and that is where the real horror story begins...i personally find this movie very good. it's not the most horrifying of all, but it is one of the best horror movies i watched. the way gage dies, is almost impossible to not stay in your memory, specially being a toddler. it's cool to see stephen king's cameo as the minister of the funeral.of course, there are some script errors: how can a rich doctor with two small kids, goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? things like that doesn't make any sense, but i can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.a good thing i saw in this movie, is the necessity to talk about death with the children, no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist, and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything. because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie, confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again, all the nightmare began.

as this happens to be one of most favorite novels , i was very excited to see the move. i was not disappointed! yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on , but i think that the movie stuck true to the book, and was a really good movie. it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones. it is such a dark story , which i guess is why i like it .. and what is better than the dead coming to life.. and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too. if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book!! it is a well written screen play , the actors could have done a better job ( i only say this for rachel , and ellie .. she was so whinny ) i liked everyone else a lot.. and most important to me .. it stuck true with the novel.

in the trivia section for pet sematary, it mentions that george romero (director of two stephen king stories, creepshow and the dark half) was set to direct and then pulled out. one wonders what he would've brought to the film, as the director mary lambert, while not really a bad director, doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of king's novel, of which he wrote the screenplay. there are of course some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister zelda, likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film), and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. but something feels missing at times, some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably king-like atmosphere, which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he'll save that for his final novel...) as mentioned though, some of the casting is terrific, notably miko hughes as gage creed, the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie, to being a little monster (i say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). and there is also a juicy supporting role for fred gwynne of the munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. and applause goes to whomever did the make-up on andrew hubatsek. but there are some other flaws though in the other casting; dale midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicted, disturbed father figure creed, and his daughter ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all.in terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces, only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil, it does involve a cool ramones song), and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining. for the most part it's a very polished directing job, though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script. if thought out in logical terms (albeit in king terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. but it doesn't add up like it could, or should. still, it makes for a nifty little midnight movie.

pet semetary (1989) 9/10 the creed family have just moved into the small town of ludlow. the family consists of a father, louis, a mother, rachel, a brother gage, and a daughter, ellen. they are greeted with kindness by jud crandall. jud is 89, and could basically tell you about the entire history of ludlow.behind the creed's new house, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery (spelled pet sematary). when ellen wants to go up to see it, jud willfully takes the family on a trip. that is the start of hell for the creed family.when rachel and the kids are gone, ellen's cat church dies. jud feels that ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat, so he suggests louis follow him further up the path, past the pet cemetery.jud tells louis of this burial ground, once used by micmac indians. louis buries church, without jud's help. a couple of days later, church returns, alive, but from hell.this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me, aside from "the exorcist." the greatest performance would ever be zelda, rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or victor pascow, a ghost who tries to help the creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead.the music in this movie plays an extravagant part. it is at the same time sad and mysterious. it goes along with the movie wonderfully.9/10

i am a big fan of stephen king's work, and this film has made me an even greater fan of king. pet sematary is about the creed family. they have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. but there is a pet cemetery behind their house. the creed's new neighbor jud (played by fred gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. that burial ground is pure evil. jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they would come back to life. the only problem, is that when they come back, they are not the same person, they're evil. soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary, everything starts to go to hell. i wont explain anymore because i don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film. the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good, but needed a little bit of work. the story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. this film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie, and frightening. one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. there is one character in this film that is truly freaky. that character is "zelda." this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. zelda is rachel creed's sister who passed away years before, but rachel is still haunted by her. the first time zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the living **** out of me. there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. pet sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good acting, first rate plot, and mesmerizing make-up. this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.

pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel. mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king's creepy story pretty well. most people may avoid this, but they should check it out.

one of the best (if not the best) stephen king's screenings. dark as dark can be, surprising non-hollywood ending, terrifying atmosphere, amazing book adaptation, outstanding cast, educational (don't play with afterlife), in short - everything an excellent horror should be...my favorite horror movie, straight 10+.

this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by dale midkiff,fred gwynne(who sadly died few years ago)and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects.director mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style,and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing,but genuinely unnerving.the depiction of the zombie child gage(miko hughes-later in "new nightmare")is equally noteworthy,as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky.as for the people,who think that this one isn't scary-watch it alone in the dark(eventually with your squeamish girlfriend)and i guarantee you that "pet sematary" will creep you out.some horror movies like this one or "the texas chain saw massacre" shouldn't be watched in group.recommended for horror fans!

not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher.the plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida, but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman, and when he realizes that he was seen, well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff.shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's, especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill, this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known, it's a pity it isn't. this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes (just try guessing who the final girl is going to be - i got it totally wrong). the principle cast are all likable and it's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away, which of course they don't. this, coupled with the fluffiness of the film's first half-an-hour jars (in a good way) with some flashes of real nastiness (the second murder provides a real jolt) and some unexpected sleaziness (even though this isn't a high budget thriller i didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast), in a film from this late in the 80's).there are one or two bad things about this movie, well not bad just minor, like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic. there aren't any sharp implements in shallow grave but, to my mind at least, it's a slasher flick through and through. the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting.all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher, with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff.

here's a real weirdo for you. it starts out with another take-off on the psycho shower scene, on campus, then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break. the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean. one of the college cuties wanders into the woods, witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open. then it's lets-rip-off macon county line-time as dean stalks, traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one. tony march is on-target as the evil, shotgun-happy dean. the movie's overall tone is truly disturbing. the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film; it's also a study in despair. shallow grave is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists the world over.

four teenage girlfriends drive to fort laurdale for spring break.unfortunately they get a flat tire in medley,georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods.the local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins..."shallow grave" is a pleasant low-budget surprise.the cast is likable enough,the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic.especially the second murder is pretty grim.the murderous sheriff isn't one-dimensional character-in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he's done.the subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere,but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 out of 10.

i really enjoyed this one, and although the ending made me angry, i still give it 10 out of 10.four college girls (baltron, kelly, stahl and cadby) are driving down to florida, on their way they meet 2 guys (turner, davis), they really add nothing to the plot, but are at least somewhat likable. the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun, but they have car problems and never make it. one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay by the car.soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes. soon she witnesses as a man (march) strangles a woman, in terror the girl flees the area, she doesn't get very far, but manages to get lost.her friends by the car go looking for her, they too go into the woods and run into the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls head off, the other girl runs away, manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed.eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested. this is when i started getting mad, these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don't believe them.they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without getting in dangerous situations.this movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene imitating psycho, graphic violence towards women and solid story. some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending, but over all, this is a great little unknown movie.

erotic cinema of the 1970's was tame compared to the triple x romps of today, which is good. because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes. of course, i wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little. plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods, but it's worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled the devil's plaything. but if you don't care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex, then this isn't the movie for you. however, i did enjoy it and i give it...7 stars.

spoilers! classic 70's sex trash! the swedish gal (helga) was what made this movie so great. she was beautiful, but what really got to me was how sexual she was. she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film. her best scenes were when she was, er, stimulating herself. whenever she was on screen, i became transfixed.also, the doctor julia (sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film) was very interesting visually. although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than julia, she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes (especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt) also grabbed my attention unmercilessly. you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid; i don't know if i've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time. classic stuff!

well, if you are looking for a great mind control movie, this is it. no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control, and naked. marie forsa, as the busty helga, is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn't. one wishes they made more movies like this one.

well the story is a little hard to follow the first time, but that's only because of all the bare breasted '70s painted-up vampire/witches dancing to the bongo drums. this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies. and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. and for girl on girl action, vampiric or not...this movie just rocks!!!

this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w.sarno.it features plenty of soft core sex,really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women.the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well-made.marie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie-it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body.sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies.a must see for fans of sexploitation!

the devil's plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production - and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats, it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste.this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle, that want to resurrect their previously murdered "leader". in order to do so, the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood, too. when a doctor and her brother's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging - they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires...but they may not be as helpless as they seem...the devil's plaything is a pretty good example of early 70's exploit sleaze. lots of nudity - including some full-frontal, some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course, lesbo-bloodsucking...but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards. some pretty hot women in this one, would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but i guess ya can't have it all. also would have benefited from some heavier violence/gore, being that it is a vampire film, but i think the purpose of the devil's plaything was more to showcase skin, not blood. still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget. worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking. 7/10

this movie probably had a $750 budget, and still managed to surpass titanic. i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car, and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief! it has to be tied with 'the assult of the killer bimbos'. things to look for are: 1. the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2. the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3. the flinstone-like screech out driving 4. the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed (don't worry, i'm not ruining any surprises, for it's soooo predictable) 5. the guy who finds it necessary to howl. 6. the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen. 7. the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall. 9. last, but not least, the wonderful special effects--especially the stab in the boob that made a... heaven help me... popping noise.enjoy!

this movie is great. if you enjoy watching b-class movies, that is. this is a classic college 80's slasher movie, in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack. a horrible film, but worth renting to make fun of, or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives. kinda funny, if you ask me.

a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film. also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original. i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies. a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film. also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original. i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies. a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film. also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original. i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.

just kidding about the weight loss thing; well, you might lose weight you never know. anyway, what can i say, i love this film. it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies. jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them. the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery, and horror they perceive. jake's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with. watch it with friends; watch it with loved ones; build a fort - wine optional.

i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster. i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family.i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions.the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults, has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create.i found the film to be delightful!

jake's closet has the emotional power of kramer vs. kramer combined with the imagination of pan's labyrinth. even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan's labyrinth. but this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today. jake's closet is about a boy, an only child, practically alone on summer vacation, dealing with his family falling apart. it's a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense, a horror movie for the thinking person. if you're looking for a slasher movie, this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting, this is the movie for you. at the screening i saw, i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed. i highly recommend catching this film.

answer: despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth.the acting in this independent film actually is quite good, despite the less-than-wonderful script. it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten, clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable. young anthony de marco, as jake, puts in a particularly good performance.fortunately, the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog. try it, especially if you're not a monster fan. this is not a horror flick. even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous, and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film, "jake's closet" is suitable for mature adults.the whole, this time, is much better than the sum of its parts.

i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing, acting and cinematography of jake's closet. the emotions were very real and intense showing, through a child's eyes, the harsh impact of divorce.a definite see!i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing, acting and cinematography of jake's closet. the emotions were very real and intense showing, through a child's eyes, the harsh impact of divorce.a definite see!

i saw this at "dances with films", and it was awesome. i really felt for jake. talk about adding insult to injury! not only are your parents getting divorced, but there's a monster after you. it was both heartfelt and scary -- there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright. it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film, except that the story was actually good.and that's what separated "jake's closet" from the usual indy film pabulum -- an excellent script with compelling characters. also, by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama, the movie gets the best out of both genres, and avoids the clichés of both.if it's not coming out in theaters, definitely get the dvd.

anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. is jake (a mesmerizing anthony demarco) simply "transferring" the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? or could the creature be real? writer/director shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia.brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry, but loving parents. however it is the creepy minor characters, mrs. bender(barbara gruen), an unhinged babysitter and sam stone (ben bode), a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind. jake's closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.

every child experiences trauma growing up and every child's active imagination has gotten the best of them, but for jake (anthony de marco  of the forthcoming clint eastwood film changeling - who resembles henry thomas circa 1982) the combination may prove deadly. a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents peter (sean bridgers, late of "deadwood") and jules (brooke bloom, "cbs: miami") suddenly decide to divorce, leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant  a zombie in his closet.jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon (matthew josten) who provides him with a print out off the internet of faq re: zombies. jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it's too late.indie newcomer shelli ryan  who wrote and directed  blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former (smartly) outweighs the latter, with a decent story buoyed by fine acting(de marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not 'acting' - all his nuances are very evident of the awkward, shy, introverted child that many can relate too (i certainly can). bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality  it doesn't help when dillon's mother ruth (monette magrath, who resembles laura dern) is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between jake and his dad. magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i won't go into detail but shows why she is the way she is (and more importantly how she has also affected her own child).the fillmmaker's subjective camera is also well employed (many angles shown form jake's pov at waist-level or somewhat skewed; i.e. the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard), and the editing is relatively flawless. ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears, anger and stress onto their children. here the film is very successful in getting its theme across.however the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a. romero's zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan (jake's mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead unspools, causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home). the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy-handed but again, the child's fear of a thing under his bed is universal.

blood castle (aka scream of the demon lover, altar of blood, ivanna--the best, but least exploitation cinema-sounding title, and so on) is a very traditional gothic romance film. that means that it has big, creepy castles, a headstrong young woman, a mysterious older man, hints of horror and the supernatural, and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term. it also means that it is very deliberately paced, and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement. if you love films like robert wise's the haunting (1963), but you also have a taste for late 1960s/early 1970s spanish and italian horror, you may love blood castle, as well.baron janos dalmar (carlos quiney) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional, unspecified european village. the locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman, she soon after ends up dead--the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them. this is quite a problem because the baron has a very healthy appetite for women. at the beginning of the film, yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated.meanwhile, dr. ivanna rakowsky (erna schürer) has appeared in the center of the village, asking to be taken to baron dalmar's castle. she's an out-of-towner who has been hired by the baron for her expertise in chemistry. of course, no one wants to go near the castle. finally, ivanna finds a shady individual (who becomes even shadier) to take her. once there, an odd woman who lives in the castle, olga (cristiana galloni), rejects ivanna and says that she shouldn't be there since she's a woman. baron dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay. she ends up staying, but somewhat reluctantly. the baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns, which the baron's brother, igor, is suffering from.unfortunately, the baron's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre, blackish liquid. and furthermore, ivanna is having bizarre, hallucinatory dreams. just what is going on at the castle? is the baron responsible for the crimes? is he insane? i wanted to like blood castle more than i did. as i mentioned, the film is very deliberate in its pacing, and most of it is very understated. i can go either way on material like that. i don't care for the haunting (yes, i'm in a very small minority there), but i'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s european horror. one of my favorite directors is mario bava. i also love dario argento's work from that period. but occasionally, blood castle moved a bit too slow for me at times. there are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle.but the atmosphere of the film is decent. director josé luis merino managed more than passable sets and locations, and they're shot fairly well by emanuele di cola. however, blood castle feels relatively low budget, and this is a roger corman-produced film, after all (which usually means a low-budget, though often surprisingly high quality "quickie"). so while there is a hint of the lushness of bava's colors and complex set decoration, everything is much more minimalist. of course, it doesn't help that the retromedia print i watched looks like a 30-year old photograph that's been left out in the sun too long. it appears "washed out", with compromised contrast.still, merino and di cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals. for example, a scene of ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that's shot from an exaggerated angle, and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only. there are also a couple ingmar bergmanesque shots, where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships, besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame.the performances are fairly good, and the women--especially schürer--are very attractive. merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity. schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres, with english titles such as sex life in a woman's prison (1974), naked and lustful (1974), strip nude for your killer (1975) and erotic exploits of a sexy seducer (1977). blood castle is much tamer, but in addition to the nudity, there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage, and of course the scenes mixing sex and death.the primary attraction here, though, is probably the story, which is much a slow-burning romance as anything else. the horror elements, the mystery elements, and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses, but in the end, blood castle is a love story, about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms (often with physical threats or harms) to be together.

i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film, this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go. all the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate,after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don't watch the movie making- just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child?

the unborn is a very, very different film. james karen & brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well. this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going. though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot. there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me that's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that's it when it comes to that. there is a scene where adams' character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real. the music is very different but very good. the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange! i recommend all horror fans to this movie!

the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia (brooke adames) & bradley marshall (jeff hayenga) who have tried for the last five years to conceive, virginia has had two miscarriages since then & is desperate to have a child. they visit dr. richard meyerling (james karen) for help after he is recommended by some of their friends, dr. meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child. dr. meyerling operates on virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & virginia is pregnant. at first everything seems perfect & the marshall's couldn't be happier, but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as virginia's pregnancy develops problems, she becomes moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worrying phone call from beth (jane cameron), another woman who has undergone dr. meyerling's procedure, who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends & is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher. virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her...produced & directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror/thriller (it's definitely not a sci-fi film as the imdb would have you believe) that pleasantly surprised me. the script by henry dominic tries to be different & it must take some credit for that at least. the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares & bad special effects, it's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears. it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means. the climax was good & seemed a fitting way to round things off & the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then, maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn't. on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements & is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times. also, i have to mention it, what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh?!director flender does an ok job, the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough. the atmosphere is good & there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her & dr. meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment. disappointingly the blood & gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens, the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it.technically the film is ok, i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland & forgettable. the baby creature is actually a decent special effect & has fairly realistic facial movement. the acting is good & this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends (1994 - 2004) star lisa kudrow, i have to be honest i don't like friends & i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did.the unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen, it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves. if your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different, something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn. followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii (1994) which i watched straight after this, check my review out if you want..

the unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy. it's very well acted by the always-good brooke adams and b-movie stalwart james karen, although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b-grader. the music, by gary numan of all people, is good too. henry dominic's script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. rodman fender's direction is merely adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap scares. if you're a fan of adams, whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be, check it out; she's great, as always.

the unborn is a roger corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless. if you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it's chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions. brooke adams stars as virginia. her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can't have kids on their own. there they meet dr. meyerling (james karen of rotld 1 & 2). dr. meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant. (insert joke here.) is it because he's creating some genetic killer supermutant babies? that's what virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment. that's when she starts taking matters into her own hands.on this one, you'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if i told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your netflix rental queue too quickly. it's a bit slow-moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third, all systems are go! very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un-pc fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.

"kolchak: the night stalker" is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a pushy, sarcastic, forty-something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) forces. based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character, this series died a quick death in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today. but will the average modern-day viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? that's actually a tough question to answer fairly. detractors of this series tend to argue that it's formulaic and hopelessly dated. on the other hand, fans argue that it's cleverly written, well-acted, and sometimes genuinely spooky. and me? i've got a foot in both camps. i thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of kolchak on dvd recently, though i can plainly see that the series has major flaws.i'll address the question of kolchak being "formula" fiction first. now, i think we can all agree that most tv shows have formulas - just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern, for example. repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; in fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy, and actively seek out, repetitive entertainment. however, the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid - it's too repetitive even by the most generous standards.in almost every episode, kolchak investigates a murder, and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster. he tries to publish a story about said monster, but his editor vincenzo blocks him, always on the grounds that kolchak doesn't have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work. and, alas, kolchak is also obstructed by the police. so, in the end, kolchak does some independent research on the monster, figures out how to kill it... and then kills it. without ceremony, or reward, or writing a big story about it.you can see where this ever-so-strict formula might get tiresome, right? i'm particularly mystified by vincenzo - if kolchak's always raving about monsters, and vincenzo never believes it... well, then, why doesn't vincenzo fire kolchak, or have him committed? that's what any normal boss would do. but the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical antagonists. as a result, many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable - though they are also quite funny.the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula, however, usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist. these select episodes are good enough that i think they're largely immune to typical criticisms of the series. some of my favorites include: horror in the heights - an episode that's noteworthy for being grimy, inventive and socially aware. kolchak's dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. though it adheres closely to the kolchak formula, the script (written by hammer studios veteran jimmy sangster) is remarkably literate, and it delves deeply into the monster's backstory.the devil's platform - a possible inspiration for the "omen" films, this episode stands out to me because the villain - a very young tom skerritt - tempts kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies (and, in so doing, reveals a lot about the reporter's character.) firefall - this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans, but i enjoyed it because it's got a great red herring and a really creepy, almost unstoppable-seeming monster.though i've singled out these three episodes for praise, i'd say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least. for my money, there are only two complete turkeys in the 20-episode run: primal scream, which is about monkey-men running rampant in chicago, and the sentry, which features the dumbest-looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment (and this assessment is coming from a lifelong doctor who and godzilla fan!) on balance, then, this is a good series. a little repetitive, a little cheesy perhaps, but it has elements of greatness. even during the weaker episodes, darren mcgavin's wonderful performance as the caustic, world-weary, endlessly funny kolchak truly shines. he carries the series effortlessly, in a way that, for example, sarah michelle gellar never managed on "buffy." mcgavin was one great character actor, and this series is worth watching for him alone.

since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed. this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's tv series "x-files"- but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach. but don't get me wrong, some of these episodes have full on horror themes, many in which have some pretty greuesome plots (left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television).some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting, but that is the charm and attraction to this series. whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi/horror themes, this series brought all that together. each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so (1 hour with commercials) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more. a great classic show that is underrated in my book!

if mulder was looking for his real father here he is darren mcgavin, the first x files, pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker, the x files. both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren mcgavin, as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero,s solving cases. paying homage to the man i think so, well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker.

i barely remember this show, a little ,but i remembered it was great! my eldest brother, reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the d.v.d set coming out. the network, again screwed up in pulling this from the air, so that they could put what else in it's place? it should have gone at least 3 seasons. why not, right? i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the 'gods' of the entertainment world. but they mis-guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time. let it be said that, they have a lot more flops than 'hits'. this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line-up. anyhow, i am getting this for my collection.

as a forty-something urban explorer/photography and longtime fan of the original kolchak: night stalker series since my early childhood, one aspect that hasn't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration carl's character undertook during the series. he always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment, sewer or tunnel after another. armed with only his trusty penlight (okay, so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel) and his camera, he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier.like many here, i recently purchased the dvd box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent tv episodes, and have been slowly revisiting all the shows. and although i remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired, its been over 30 years passed...so many of them seem new all over again. campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining. they just don't make stuff like this these days. now its all regurgitated spin-offs with predictable characters and plots.thankfully, my 16-yr-old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she enjoys the genre). it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come.

kolchak is sheer entertainment. great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down. darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him. simon oakland, jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having. some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes - erik estrada in legacy of terror, phil silvers in horror in the heights, antonio fargas in the zombie. it's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files. darren - rip. simon - rip. ruth - rip.

there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written, seminal tv show (the "godfather" to x-files and buffy, etc.); as a monster show (it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid!), or as a well-written/acted gumshoe/film-noir. it works on both levels. the scariness may have been diluted over the years (it was made in the mid-70s), but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show (via dvd) that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons. the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak, an eccentric, tenacious, rumpled newsman/monster-hunter who, in pursuit of a story, always finds a supernatural angle; much to the pain of kolchak's over-stressed, put-upon boss tony vincenzo(played with tremendous world-weariness by the also late, great simon oakland; you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers!). the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty (much like star trek's spock and mccoy, only more acidic!). over the course of two pilot tv movies and a one-season series, kolchack fought vampires, robots, werewolves, witches, zombies, government conspiracies, aliens, and ancient legends (sounds like the entire 9 yr. run of the x-files! in one season!). and kolchak did it first! and as for composer gil melle's cool, partly-whistled main title music... well, x-files creator chris carter calls mike snow's (very similar) x-files main title theme an 'homage.' both themes work well; leave it at that. and unlike many modern horror/sci-fi shows, most of kolchak's monsters are shown in shadow, and in quick cuts(effectively, and sometimes thankfully; as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny; but some still do). modern horror shows take note: less is more! one of the few flaws of the show (and it's a small one) is the over-use of sunny, california locales passing for windy city chicago. night gallery had the same issue; unavoidable for a modest-budget, l.a. based show. and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are (now) viewed as clichés (the effeminate reporter, ron updike, always used for comic relief; sweet, old lady/advice columnist emily). but, they all do have their moments to shine (unlike many supporting tv characters since, cliché or not!). kolchak is a timeless show, that serves as a template for many that followed. and carl kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre tv show (agent mulder's real dad). and as a footnote, i tried watching a few episodes of the new, "re-imagining" of the show. it's an x-files clone (a copy of a copy?). and a bad one, at that. carl kolchak is now a model-pretty, angsty 30-something (played dismally by a boring stuart townsend). and giving him a scully-type partner is also a lame idea; it undermines kolchak as a lone, don quixote crusader! and kolchak and vincenzo getting along? where's the tension? the interplay? that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this regurgitated bit o' crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake: take a beloved cult series, scrape off everything unique about it, drain it of all character and color (but keep the name! need that cult cred!), and voilà! instant re-hash! it gets an 'f' in 're-imaginings 101'! this new version deserved the axe! stick with the short-lived, but classic original. it truly gets better with age.

a couple of years back i had purchased (and enjoyed) the mgm double-feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies, the night stalker (1971) and the night strangler (1972). when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out, i had intended to buy it immediately – but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd-18s kept me from adding it to my collection; recently, i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak 3-discer as well.having watched it now, i can safely say that i didn’t regret acquiring this beloved (if short-lived) crime/horror series one bit: it may follow a standardized formula – dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak, marvelously played by darren mcgavin, gets into everybody’s hair with his attitude (flustered editor simon oakland, long-suffering colleagues, assorted authoritarian figures, a plethora of monsters and villains), faces up to the inevitable (and usually supernatural) threat alone but, finally, is pressured into keeping his story under wraps – but a winning one (further boosted by an impressive line-up of guest stars and notable behind-the-scenes credits), making the show a great deal of fun.that said, quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make-up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired (for instance, the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment) – not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50-minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes (in the case of the werewolf, again, he’s never seen biting anyone but, somewhat foolishly, is made to merely throw people around)! while the hero’s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots, there’s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, revolving around mcgavin’s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage) – to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere (the setting, for the most part, is chicago) and suspense. to make the ride even more pleasant, there’s a bouncy score by gil melle' and jerry fielding.for the record, the monsters encountered (but not always defeated) by kolchak throughout the series are: a revived jack the ripper, a variety of cults (voodoo, native american, aztec), aliens, vampire, werewolf (going round its over-familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise-liner!), doppelganger, satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcyclist, succubus, a knight’s armor taking a murderous life of its own (the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast – featuring john dehner as a morose police captain, hans conried and robert emhardt), helen of troy(!) and crocodile. some of the actors (other than those playing kolchak’s co-workers) return in the same roles – keenan wynn and ramon bieri (both as officers of the law), john fiedler (as a shrewd morgue attendant) and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero. if i were pressed to choose the finest (or most entertaining) episodes, i’d lean towards horror in the heights (co-starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer) and the afore-mentioned the knightly murders – while, as the weakest, i’d go for the werewolf (due to reasons i’ve already explained) and chopper (based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale!).unfortunately, the set contains no extras: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak: the night stalker, as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing, or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci-fi series popular today. in fact, kolchak himself – in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise – returned in a 2005 revival; this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet…but, for various reasons, i’m not sure i’d want to check it out so soon after the 1974-5 classic!

"kolchak" was a tv series that really didn't fit into any category. part horror, part comedy, some social awareness thrown in, and what we have is something that i think people weren't ready for. it's a shame really, as i've started to watch these shows on the chiller network, (i never saw the originals), i realized how different and interesting it really was. starring darren mcgavin as kolchak a reporter for the international news service, and simon oakland as his always angry boss, tony vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of a chicago news reporter who more often than not, became a part of the story himself, as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night. the underlying charm of macgavin really sets the show apart. a somewhat goofy guy, who always wears the same suit, you cannot help but love him. his jokes are great, and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor, oakland, are downright hilarious. the stories are for the most part pretty good, and the acting is very good. the 70's were not a *great* period for special effects, and the show suffers for it, but if you suspend disbelief, what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it's time.

i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter. kolchak was hard-bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big-city reporting, and his gritty determination and wise-ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable. my personal fave was "the spanish moss murders" due to it's totally original storyline. a poor,troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country, takes part in a sleep research experiment, for the purpose of dream analysis. something goes inexplicably wrong, and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state, and brutally suffocates them to death. kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth, much to the chagrin of police captain joe "mad dog" siska(wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn)and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder, severn darden, to droll, understated perfection. the wickedly funny, harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system, and is a series highlight. kolchak never got any better. timeless.

i'd love to give kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went from scary/suspenseful to silly. abc's fault. they moved the show to friday nights at 8:00 p.m., then known as the "family hour". never should have been on fridays in the first place. i was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes! it was first up against police woman on nbc. abc had huge problems with friday nights. bad season for them overall until barney miller, baretta, and swat debuted in january of '75. kolchak should have been a hit. darren mcgavin begged to get out of his contract to end the show. too bad the writing wasn't up to richard matheson's in the original tv movies. still, mcgavin made kolchak his own, as actors can do. jackie gleason as ralph kramden and caroll o'connor as archie bunker come to mind. that ins set with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and ancient today, yet that was part of the appeal. they were very lucky to have simon oakland reprise "vincenzo" from the tv films.

it's a genuine shame that this spin-off tv series inspired by the superior made-for-tv pictures "the night stalker" and "the night strangler" only lasted a single season and twenty episodes, because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor (carl kolchak's spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear), clever writing, nifty supernatural menaces (gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in "the spanish moss murders," "the sentry," and "horror in the heights," plus you can't go wrong with such tried'n'true fright favorites as zombies, vampires, werewolves, and witches), colorful characters, lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars (legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in "the energy eater" while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn, john fiedler, john dehner, severn darden, and william daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of genuine suspense (the sewer-set climax of "the spanish moss murders" in particular was truly harrowing), and, best of all, the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash, aggressive, and excitable, but basically decent, brave, and honest small-time chicago, illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchak.kolchak was the quintessential 70's everyman protagonist, a wily and quick-witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble. moreover, the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman; he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat, yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes. kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters: simon oakland was perfect as carl's chronically ill-tempered boss tony vincenzo, jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil, ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles, and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein (who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes). granted, the show did suffer from lackluster make-up and special effects (the titular lycanthrope in "the werewolf" unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier!) and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters (the headless motorcyclist in "chopper," cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in "the youth killer'), but even the second-rate shows are redeemed by the program's trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavin's boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence.

i loved kolchak: the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13, 1974. i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle (hey, where's the soundtrack guys?) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple, important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level. when darren mcgavin's carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. it's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force. he's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works. sometimes, he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are. in one episode, he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it, he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly, he must go back and defend himself. he's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him. he's a regular guy, doing a job, trying to make a buck, not a monster-hunter. he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural, which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do. if his plan to defeat the creature didn't work, you will often see him running for his life to get away from it, which is of course what i would do in the situation. that's why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid. kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him. you were scared for him and for the other characters too. the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit, scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters. darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a "monster of the week" show and he decided not to continue. i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but, as an adult, i can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long. i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling, determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the ins, known as carl kolchak. i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show. it's not the monsters, darkly-lit sets, creepy music or goofy guest stars, although they are all vital ingredients. the secret to it's success is right there in the title - "kolchak: the night stalker". without mcgavin's lovable, bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't a night stalker.

weak scripts at times? yep! cheesy special effects at times? yep! deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? yep! more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin? yep! i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but found so much of the dracula/frankenstein/mummy/horror stuff as just so much crap. it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the "dark side" of entertainment. the duke had rooster cogburn, eastwood had dirty harry, garner had maverick and rockford, selleck had magnum, and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak. mixed in with all those weak scripts, cheesy special effects, that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars, there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak. he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger, was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth, and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. additionally, unlike 98% of us, kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his demise, the end of his journalistic career, or jail time. for all his faults, including no taste in clothes, carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang (which was an old used car at the time) on his way to save the day for humanity. as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin. now that he's passed on and his show is on dvd, i hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again!

when originally screened in america in 1972, 'the night stalker' became the highest rated made-for-t.v. movie in history. based on jeff rice's unpublished novel, it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak ( the late darren mcgavin ) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day las vegas. when it arrived on british television four years later, it did not quite have the same impact, but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning, as indeed was i. we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen. i did not know of the existence of 'the night strangler' until it turned up nearly a decade later. i.t.v., who screened the 'kolchak' movies, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt 'barnaby jones' starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw, and anyway, viewers might confuse 'kolchak' with 'kojak'! for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine. i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels.then something wonderful happened. in 1990, b.b.c.-2 put out the show as part of a late-night friday series devoted to the supernatural called 'mystery train', hosted by richard o'brian. 'kolchak' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'the brain eaters' and 'earth vs.the spider'. the opening titles were trimmed, removing kolchak's whistling, and the closing credits...well, there were none.the first episode screened was 'werewolf'. i cannot say i was overly impressed, but stuck with it, and am i glad that i did!i really wish i'd seen it in 1974. my twelve year old self would have adored it. creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder it fired chris carter's imagination. the show's biggest asset was, of course, mcgavin. unlike the recent kolchak, the original was an everyman figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. he was to the supernatural what 'columbo' was to crime. the late simon oakland was great too as kolchak's bad-tempered boss tony vincenzo. the scripts overflowed with wonderful, dry wit. i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror. when the twenty episodes ended, i felt bereft.'the x-files' came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent. i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back. i am glad that the show was never revived though. without oakland it would not have been the same.i have the rice books now and have read them several times. i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first ( in his book 'danse macabre' ) as it is as good as anything he has written. alright, so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art, but so what? the new 'kolchak' totally missed the point of the original. what you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do...best episode - 'horror in the heights' worst episode - 'the sentry'

one of my favorite shows back in the '70s. as i recall it went to air on friday (or possibly saturday)night on the nine network (?) here in australia. darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together.each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. to their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible.i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which/who 'came back' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital. the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames. oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best.definitely deserves a place in tv's "hall of fame". to quote tony vincenzo .... 'kolchack you are on it '... or, in the case of the hall of fame,'in it' !

a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck."mirage" is obviously inspired by spielberg's "duel" and craven's "the hills have eyes".still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.the film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.b.g.steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10.

i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). i don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (todd schaefer, kenny johnson and kevin mcparland). i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. it's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. but where do i find it? how can i download it?

well, this was one of those films i caught on the off-chance, and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time... if, like myself, you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm (i.e. not just another glut of generic sequels) then i think you may enjoy this. when the bad guy eventually turns up in person, he was definitely not what i expected to see! all in all, i wouldn't go out of your way for this one, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, i guess. i'd give it 6.5 out of 10.

this movie, which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less, moving vehicle, has quite the quirky little personality to boot. the cast of seven (although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert (an odd but effective choice of setting), who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. it predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("the trip", "joy ride", "jeepers creepers") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. the killer himself is quite creepy, and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire, as scanty and stonewashed as it may be). director bill crain does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast tries their absolute best. there's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough t&a from a couple of the girls to please t&a fans. overall, this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video. highly recommended.

mirage (1990) is a very rare horror/chiller from 1990, released here in the uk on the "new world video" label.it's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck!!! this film has some creepy scenes, and some gore here and there, but i have to say that the acting was so lame, even by low budget standards! but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it, and i never fell asleep or turned it off, which is always a good sign! i nearly gave this movie 6/10, but seeing as it built up steam along the way, had some good moments of gore and suspense, had some good nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too! i'll give it 7/10.

bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts. the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons; - a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most post-halloween genre pieces. but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect. just as wally koz's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family, mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director. looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature. but despite fairly good distribution across the globe, the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market. nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert, which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location. with that said though, i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly. four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way. chris (jennifer mcallister) and her boyfriend greg (kenny johnson) meet up with amusing new age hippies trip (kevin mcparland) and mary (nicole anton) at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune-like wilderness. greg's older brother kyle (todd schaefer) and his buxom girlfriend bambi (laura albert) soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave. kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget. sound like a motive for a massacre? well what did you expect? before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve. will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel? i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature. i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others. mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography, so your guess is as good as mine. judging by the credible work behind the camera, i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience. the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain, and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary. r. christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome, and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent 18 rating. a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre. one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade, while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck! there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional. we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters. but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey, i didn't quite know what to expect. thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically.there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast. the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b.g. steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse. the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential. the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation, which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs. watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film-making at it's freakiest.mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite. when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck, you have to say that they did a damn good job. the flaws are numerous, but never detract credibility from the net result. unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy. if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store, then make sure you pick it up. recommended.

this movie catches a lot of flak, but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered / clothed version of the film that played us television and has also been issued to death on vhs and dvd buy companies like alpha, unicorn, etc. this movie never had a theatrical release in the states, although it was picked up by avco embassy in 1973. in spain at the time, when there was nudity involved, the filmmakers shot two versions, one with clothes and one with out. the fully uncut english dubbed export print was titled werewolf never sleeps and seems to have been released to home video only in sweden back in the 80's. it can be found on ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended. my guess is avco cut the film down for a r rated release that never happened. in 1974 it was released by avco to television titled fury of the wolfman and the clothed version was used for this tv print. cut to 12 years later and fury of the wolfman pops up on home video on the charter label. this version appears to be what avco was going to release back in '73. it's the uncovered version, with some nudity that would never pass on tv or in a pg movie. there are several scenes on the charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the tv print ( the source for all those dollar dud's and vhs editions ). but a comparison to the fully uncut wolfman never sleeps reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version! ( spoilers in next paragraph ) the scene where ilona has waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete. after whipping him into submission, she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf!!! the werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too. this scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat. it's not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for us audiences, or more likely the mpaa. ilona is desperately in love with waldemar and could not possess him, hence her whole scheme to mind control waldermar's wife and involve her in an affair. she wanted to wreck his marriage, and she accomplishes this while waldemar is in tibet. unfortunately he returns a werewolf, but this does not slow her down a bit. if she can't physically have him as a man, she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf. this also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window. this scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense. in the uncut version, it would seem ilona's affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release, so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping. the other cut is a complete scene of waldemar in bed with karen and she is seen naked. a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow ( werewolf vs the vampire woman ) as well. the film does have it's problems though, for certain. the director was drunk, the bad stand in for the werewolf at points, the atrocious english dubbing, the inclusion of sequences from the first waldemar film mark of the wolfman aka frankenstein's bloody terror and the grotesque overuse of that film's music score throughout etc, but seen in it's original widescreen format and uncut ( ie: werewolf never sleeps ) it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the daninsky werewolf series, with a plot line unmatched in it's everything but the kitchen sink approach. the cut / clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors, and unfortunately that's the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen. the film carries a 1970 copyright, and i'd bet the 1972 release date on the imdb is incorrect. the film precedes werewolf shadow ( aka werewolf vs the vampire woman ) in the series and was certainly released before werewolf shadow. the ending of werewolf never sleeps / fury of the wolfman dovetails directly into the opening of werewolf shadow, offering concrete evidence of this. sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release. a perfect release would be the uncut english version but in spanish with english subtitles. the english dubbing severely hurts the movie. but any spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in spain during the franco era, where nudity was verboten.

this movie is stuffed full of stock horror movie goodies: chained lunatics, pre-meditated murder, a mad (vaguely lesbian) female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, spooky castles, werewolves (male and female), adultery, slain lovers, tibetan mystics, the half-man/half-plant victim of some unnamed experiment, grave robbing, mind control, walled up bodies, a car crash on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in armour - the lot, all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst foley work ever done.the script is incomprehensible (even by badly dubbed spanish horror movie standards) and some of the editing is just bizarre. in one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed: "that is fantastical. i do not understand. explain to me again how this is..." exposition scenes that litter this movie, there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientist's "mwahaha! all your werewolfs belong mine!" speech. though why they went to the bother i don't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place - even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print i saw.the director was, according to one interview with the star, drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it. it is an incoherent mess. it's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film the mark of the wolf man (made 4 years earlier, featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up - is there a word in spanish for "continuity"?) and more padding of another actor in the wolfman get-up ambling about in long shot.the music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music, to bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded. (thinking about it, it might not have been a duet. it might have been a solo. the piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other.) this is one of the most bewilderedly trance-state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me. enjoy.favourite line: "ilona! this madness and perversity will turn against you!" how true.favourite shot: the lover, discovering his girlfriend slain, dropping the candle in a cartoon-like demonstration of surprise. rank amateur directing there.

someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing paul naschy's "fury of the wolfman" to the great spanish surrealist films, "l'age d'or" and "un chien andelou". the naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end. dali and bunuel probably loved it, and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off.the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c. some mishmash about a "professor walterman" -- his first name, mind you -- who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasn't been the same since, which is understandable. one of his jealous colleagues, the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein, knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him. but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast."walterman" flips out, turns into a werewolf, kills a few people, is electrocuted, dies, is buried, unburied, taken to a castle filled with circus freaks, wired to various machines, zapped with assorted electronic effects, injected with potent elixirs, is chained up, turns into a werewolf, a woman in an evening gown with thigh-high nazi fetish boots whips him, he escapes, helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle, fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe, eventually turns back into a werewolf, and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife. the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol, they die together, and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter, who did nothing. "look! what a beautiful day it is!" "la furia del hombre lobo" was written by paul naschy in a hurry. original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by josé maría zabalza, a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production. he was often unable to work (though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script) and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited. zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschy's previous movies, "mark of the wolfman". the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different, and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie. post production was a nightmare. nobody knew who was doing the editing, the money ran out, the master print disappeared for a while, and then at a pre-release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater. he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb.yet somehow the film works, if you let it. it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles, vaulted catacombs, chains, whips, gloomy moors. fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn't make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution. in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning; in the next shot its bone dry and he's howling at the full moon. then its raining again. and yet you don't look at it as a gaffe. its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible, opposites are the same, and effects proceed causes; first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams, and then the cable starts sparking with electricity. people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness -- i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend. it is a marvel of making something out of nothing, and succeeds not because of what it could of had, but because of what it does. it's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it. the trick is being able to see through the mayhem, or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect.paul naschy died last week at the age of 75. he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more, was working on film projects right up until his last days, but passed away in madrid, spain, with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment. his rich, varied, and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest. and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like "fury of the wolfman" in rapt awe. even people who don't like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at, if only for just a minute in a couple spots. you can find it for free at archive.org or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel. it's worth far, far more.amusingly, naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted, sick, demented little movie as a classic, if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia. the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive. i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him, but i will say this: i'd rather watch "fury of the wolfman" in its dingiest, most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing, obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekend.the world lost a great artist this month. watch his films, and remember.9/10

the first time i saw it i got half of it but i watched and i knew later on it was about a salem witch trials. they focused on the sara good's family. she is famous for cursing a priest which came true. in the film it depicts her daughter dorcas and her husband the spirit of ann putnam sara's husband comes to the future hunts this girl to redeem her soul. which does happen at the end of the movie. dorcas is depict as witch at 5years old who is burned at the stake. which never happen ann putnam saves her from the flames. the girl is safe she goes to ann putnam's grave to to see that is not empty but it is at first because she accuse her of witchcraft, and lets her burn to death. now that ann putnam saves her her spirit is redeemed, and she is not a outcast to society for the salem witch trials.

in the seemingly endless quest to find well made, well acted horror films, it is all-too-rare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark. needless to say, i was very pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across "burned at the stake" on a u.s. cable network while i was flipping channels. the premise is reasonably simple. in 1692, young ann putnam (swift) is the most vocal witness against alleged witches, leveling baseless charges against anyone who earns her displeasure. manipulating her for his own ends is reverend parris (peters) who also serves as the court's guide on matters pertaining to witchcraft and satanism. things get complicated when ann starts accusing members of the goode family of witchcraft. salem (of 1980 or so), loreen graham (also played by swift) begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the salem witch museum. a strange man in seventeenth century garb tries to accost her there and the building. he continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more. soon, it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of ann putnam. unfortunately, further description gets rather involved and would give too much away. though the film is not action-oriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very convincing. the production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects. in a side-note, the film's technical advisor was laurie cabot, salem's official witch. viewers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric, but understated horror film may appreciate this. the writer/director, bert i. gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of "big bug" films and similar works years earlier.

the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift, an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress. time travel movies usually don't interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. it didn't rely on outrageous special effects and it didn't focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused. this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all.

there's a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist, actually exist right now. it's a bit too much to wrap your head around, but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place. for barbara jean trenton (ida lupino), that time was twenty five years earlier, the mid 1930's when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise. for my part, if i could travel through time, it would be back to the 1950's when i grew up. maybe to a place like willoughby, but that's another episode.one thing that wouldn't be so special about 1959 would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of "the twilight zone". how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series, and then find a particular story you wanted to watch? i guess you have to consider the trade offs, convenience versus simplicity, having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins. popping in a cd has it's advantages.i'm a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled "sunset boulevard". ida lupino's character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept. martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim, the husband turned butler who's loyalty is unquestioned. where the story diverges has to do with the way danny (balsam) and sall (ted de corsia) challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence.fortunately for us viewers, ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were 'not big, but a nice showcase'. it's a real treat to watch any episode of "the twilight zone" and get to see who pops up from days gone by. sometimes you get a two-fer, like you have here with lupino and balsam, celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began, and sometimes after. combined with the stories that the program produced, it's not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today.

i really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired. from a pure writing perspective, 'the 16mm shrine' is an absolute treat, with fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical of sterling. in particular i really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, tackling themes of existence and reality, whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial, pride, and desire. 'the sixteen-millimeter shrine' is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever-changing world. it is also a fantastic example of cerebral twilight zone; one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it. these elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes.the episode is not without its faults however, which mainly lay in lupino and leisen shoes. ironically, i felt lupino was unconvincing throughout, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable. this of course being an absolute shame considering how well sterling had written her character. furthermore leisen didn't seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing -which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from lupino half the time-. thankfully balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots, helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least.as i said previously however, if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction, this shouldn't be as bad as it's sometimes made out to be. in addition to the writing that i mentioned above, the episode also features some fantastic photography (it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later!) and decent enough set-design. overall 'the sixteen-millimeter shrine" is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think.

after hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat, serling continued to go about introducing viewers to 'the twilight zone' in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode. 'the sixteen-millimeter shrine' is one of the more understated episodes, focusing on an aging movie star's inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes. because of this approach, the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story.both the leads, ida lupino as barbara jean trent and martin balsam as her frustrated but caring agent, shine in their performances. the main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing. lupino looks identical when playing the young trent as she does when playing the middle aged trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly. fortunately, lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past. it's a situation most can sympathise with, and yet trent is far from a sympathetic character. she is a prima-donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her, such as the disastrously withered co-star who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were. it is somewhat surprising, then, that she is rewarded with a happy ending. it is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre-empted in the opening moments when trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen. what is not clear at the beginning, however, is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment. as it turns out, trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for, a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can be.'the sixteen-millimeter shrine' gets better with each viewing. the top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past, even though we can never return. except in the twilight zone.

"a thief in the night" is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low-budget (which was obvious) and its subject matter--the rapture of true christian church and the fate of those left behind. nevertheless, it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with jesus christ. it touched everyone--showing even a pastor who preached the word, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why he was left behind. this movie, and its sequel "distant thunder," are must see movies. even with the new "left behind" series coming out, telling the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is still the same--"a thief in the night" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.

this film was really eye-opening. i have seen this film several times. first, when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was 12. the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him.a great movie for non-believers and believers alike!

i would say for it's time, this movie was awesome...and yes if you have no desire to become a christian, then why bother watching it. i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving. i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. i think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself!! god will bless you if that is why you are watching them.

i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it's awesome. but the only thing with it was that in the beginning, there was too much talk of who's going out with who. i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it. but on the official site, they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it. what's even happened to patty dunning now? she is a pretty good actress. she has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard from her since. i know for sure about thom rachford, who plays jerry, works for accounting at rd films. but overall, i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school.

i've read most of the comments on this movie. i have seen this movie(and the whole prophecy series) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times. no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts. the movie is just based on biblical facts. i have seen a lot of end time movies "tribulation", "armagedon" and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths. it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool. this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraise.com, and judge for yourself. blessings to all.

this is a great movie for all generation x'ers. what a different world the america of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st century. you can get a sense of what an 1972 america gone by was like by watching this movie. i found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now. just think...back then there were only 4 or 5 tv stations to choose from. there was no aids, muslim terrorists, road rage, 911, bird flu, freeway snipers, etc, etc. the vietnam war was just over. there will still be 7 years before star wars comes out. the personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away.when this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it. so it began touring small protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors(this was the days before vcrs of course). the pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film. then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room. members of the congregation would invite "unsaved" friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week. if you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value, then i think you will enjoy the film more. of course i am speaking as a gen xer. if i had a time machine i would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now.

a thief in the night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers. i have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting god. they just needed to find an excuse and blamed a thief in the night. do not listen! these movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation, but they're also fun to watch in their simplicity. they are in fact low-budget and that is a little obvious, but not all too obvious upon first viewing. i had no clue because i really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70's included low-budgets all the time.a thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical patty myers who lives for what comes her way, until her husband, and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about. at first, the movie isn't all based around her until the rapture happens. what it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in christ, which is usually what happens to a lot of people. everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever, and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves. no one can ever blame themselves because they're always right.just like these whiners who complain about the movie. these people must be full grown adults. i'm thirteen, and you don't see me whining, especially since i was exactly like patty before i re-accepted christ into my heart. for those who haven't seen it, if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a christian movie instead of stereo-typical everyone else is wrong movies, than you'll enjoy a thief in the night. don't knock it before you try it. something new is always good. trust your own instincts.

this is a great movie. some will disagree with me but , if you know anything about the bible you know it is. i think everyone should see it!! i agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on. if you can see this movie. is not a "scare the hell of you movie",it is truthful with the bible. i think the u. n. will play a major role in the world government to come. the last days are lining up with the bible. look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped. it's the size of a grain of rice. this i feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the bible. without the mark you can't sell or buy, with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it.

a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal event.i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian movie.the production values. hey, it's an independent movie, with a shoe-string budget, so, ya, it's going to look a bit cheesy (if your standard is a-list hollywood fare). but, properly compared with other independent movies, this film is perfectly acceptable. more important than acting style, costumes, and music is the narrative itself. is the story compelling? do the dramatic moments work? does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax? the answer to all these questions is an unqualified "yes." as a side-note, the truly important technical stuff--continuity, sound, lighting--are fine. the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship.content value. the message of the movie is superb. when you consider how many ideas the movie-maker developed within the brief span of 69 minutes, you begin to appreciate his artistry. he presents the message of salvation, the consequence of unbelief, the danger of backsliding, the truth of the rapture, and the threat of a world-dominating satanic government with flare, imagination, and--most importantly for an evangelical movie--with biblical accuracy.the movie-maker is a good storyteller. for example, he develops the message of salvation in two important ways: (1) he shows us through action the reality of jesus christ's sacrifice for our sake. this is achieved in a subplot where the zoo-keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies. the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake-poison. the poison is like sin; the cure is like christ's blood, shed on the cross. (2) the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog. he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ. so, the movie-maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story.as a side-note, the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation, couched in explicitly evangelical christian language, imagery, and theology is also perfectly acceptable. to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd; it's akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sport-wear. what else would evangelical christian movie makers make, if not a film that states their case? also, the fact that the movie-maker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is, again, perfectly acceptable. the movie-maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably. how do i know? i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974; it still lived in her memory thirty years later. how many movies can you say that about? all around, a very enjoyable, thought-provoking show. i plan on showing it to my teen group at church.

obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot. i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other (great) chinese films. i first saw this when i was 14 years old, i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything...

to all the reviewers on this page, i would have to say this movie is worth seeing. so it was made in 1972, so what. the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time. people who didn't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball. compared to the modern series, `left behind,' (which is made for our time right now) it does look cheezy. however, the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion, which again was over 30 years in the past. but. the message that is sent in this film is very powerful, and carefully preserved. there is just so much to say, but i refuse to say it. (for fear of spoiling it) so go out and see this film! if you don't like the message that it sends, then you have issues, that need some attention!

i remember seeing this movie a long time ago, back then even though it didn't have any special effects, the acting was really good. and it still has the same message for today, even though the technology has changed, maybe they should make a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well, larry norman was a really good songwriter during that time period, although now most christian music is now worship and praise music. i was always curious to know what ever happened to patty after the series ended? did she go on to make more movies, did she get eventually get married and raise a family? i would like to have an update.

the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did!! that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it. when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion. this is not a blood and gore scary type movie, but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written. of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie. truth is, this movie is a must have for your thriller collection, even if it does have a religious view. if you are a fan of classic thrillers (omen..etc) this is one of them and its a must have. i never saw the sequel (distant thunder), but i believe it picks up where this movie ends.

now, for all of the cinematographical buffs out there, this film may not rank high on your list of things to see. but if you know anything about plot development, profound truth, and the intentions that this film (the series) had, you'd understand my p.o.v.granted, the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer, who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end. but the film is biblically accurate and justifiably "scares" viewers into thinking about what may be. i'm a christian, not due to this movie, but due to my personal decision to accept jesus as my savior. the film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions. it's not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in god, but rather, a means to get your attention.as a christian, i know i'll not be left behind, and thanks to movies like this, i can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment, acting, and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer. this is a movie you shouldn't not only see, but feel with your heart and soul.

long before tim lahaye and jerry b. jenkins would shake the world of the christian subculture (and make millions in the process) with the left behind books, mark iv pictures, the christian film distribution company of the billy graham evangelistic association, gave us this masterwork. what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-rapture" tribulation, we sit in the living room, hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can't afford to show it. the film's premise is grounded in pre-millenial, pre-tribulation eschatalogy, believing that christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church, and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. what used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh. the intriguing adventures of patty and her journey throughout the tribulation (and two of the film's three sequels) tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation. i hate to admit it, but i still thoroughly enjoy watching this. it even has the same exact score of monty python and the holy grail. i think i'm the only person in history to make that observation.

this is a cute little horror spoof/comedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira: mistress of the dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network. they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references. this film however, is very amusing. elvira is the modern-day chesty morgan and the queen of the one-liners. this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal "elvira's haunted hills" which was meant to be a take-off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it's face. watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience!

cassandra peterson originally created elvira as the television hostess of late-night horror films, and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on the tonight show with johnny carson. she reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film elvira, mistress of the dark was the result.the plot is flyweight. television horror film hostess elvira dreams of success in las vegas. when her great aunt dies, she travels to new england in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show; she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle, and an old book. it happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description, and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes. it also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on "the old book." throw in a few teenagers, a stud muffin, and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go.no one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it does drag now and then. but cassandra peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish: squirmy, sexy, and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-mocking jokes. from a flashdance disaster to witchcraft craziness, she is never less than wildly entertaining. it's a tremendous amount of fun, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense. will elvira best her evil uncle and save the day? well, i don't want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out.dvd quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge. and if you've never seen tassle-twirling, you're in for a treat. recommended.gft, amazon reviewer

those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie - she is just plain cool - her car is great, and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton - she is so innocent and naive at times - and sexy all of the time - plus, more than a touch of mae west -the sets are well done as well, and the comic cast is great, with edie mcclurg at her usual best - plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious. any time i have to crunch something for a topping, i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips -this movie is one to be watched again and again - just for the fun of it. now i have to get the sequel to it, elvira's haunted hills, and see if it lives up to this one ----

elvira, mistress of the dark, is a fun, camp horror comedy, in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel. and the breasts of cassandra peterson become a character of their own.elvira (cassandra peterson) is stacked horror show hostess, who learns, that she has inherited her aunt morgana. so she goes to a little town of fallwell, which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth: morality comity. elviras boobacious appearance is, of course, too much for the prunes, but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life. and of course there is even more sinister evil, her uncle vincent (william morgan sheppard), who is after elvira's mothers book of spells. see, elvira actually is a real witch, she just doesn't know it. yet.for what it is, elvira is quite funny film, even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement. most laughs come from the difference between elvira and the people of good morals, but there are a couple of good visual gags as well. over all direction is okay, but it never rises to be anything more than that. in all, a good, intentionally campy, comedy. if you like this kind of thing, that is.

i wasn't expecting much, and, to be honest, i didn't like this film the first time around but watching it again and i realised that it's kinda cool. sure, it's a one joke film but it's a funny gag. someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. i think this film had the potential to be a over-the-top my cousin vinny. but with a horror host instead of a lawyer. sadly it's a wasted opportunity. with just a bit more writing it could be a classic. the kids are underused there's no reason why they should latch on to elvira. apart from the obvious reasons. it would have been great to see their relationship flourish. i know it's a comedy but it's little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant.elvira herself is always fun and engaging. not to mention flirty. every time she smiles you will too. it's hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming. and it really is her charm, don't let her looks fool you into thinking that she's some sort of tart. well she is. but she's a nice one. the sort of person you'd let look after your kids. wouldn't let her cook for them, though...i'd recommend giving it a go. just don't expect too much.she's more than just a great set of boobs. she's also an incredible pair of legs.

the magnetism radiated from elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. with her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. in the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. fortunately, i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.best quote: bob redding: how's your head? elvira: i haven't had any complaints.

to be honest i watched this movie only because of my pubert needs. i mean, i couldn't get women at my age (i was 9 or 10) so i thought watching elvira's cleavage was the closet thing to sex.i ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy, halloween parties, sassy humor, and some sexy evil displayed by elvira.they just don't make movies like this anymore... it had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style. the truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it's humor and the ability to perform by cassandra. this is classic that reminds me of the good days of usa up all night.

since the start of her career in the 70's and vastly throughout the exuberant 80's, elvira (cassandra peterson) has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror & bad monster movies. while ms. peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures, covering a wide variety in genres, it was her tv-character elvira that brought her the most fame. part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous (unlike many other big name actors & actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their "early" work). i've seen only bits & pieces of her tv performances, but her cameo role in ghoultown's recent tribute song "mistress of the dark" really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff. one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video: over the years, elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid-80's came around.and in 1988, after films like "fright night" and "terrorvision" incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv-work, it finally happened: "elvira, mistress of the dark", the motion picture. now, i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days, but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film. a few years ago, i did manage to watch "elvira's haunted hills" (made in 2001), but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much. was it really that forgettable, or should i give it another watch? i actually really do feel like re-watching it now, as this first elvira film from '88 really convinced me. though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work, might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script, there really is no way to deny it: cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy (she also co-wrote the screenplay).when elvira learns she's one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt (she never heard of before), she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas. out to claim her rightfully inherited money, she travels to a quiet new england town. but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat. in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her (often unintentionally) provocative behaviour. to make things worse, her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected: a rundown mansion, a cookbook and a poodle. but what she doesn't know, and her evil uncle vincent albot does, is that her great aunt was a witch, and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable. and if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book, then rest assured, you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face.it's surprising how a script rigged together with boob-jokes, witty one-liners, movie references, inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story. simple, of course, but coherent. while other movies, heavily relying on gag-like situations, often make you loose track of the story completely (like the "naked gun" films, for example), this film doesn't. a lot of horror-comedies were being produced during the 80's, but not a lot of them actually worked. let alone a horror-spoof that doesn't derail at some point ("killer party", although i'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale) or becomes too tedious too quickly ("saturday the 14th"). although "elvira" is more comedy than horror, it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale, complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot, including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and elvira's very own burn-at-the-stake moment.i'm telling you, there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny. one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already, when daniel greene's name appeared. daniel who? oh yes, i recognized his name (and later on his dim-witted macho-face). how can one not forget daniel greene once you've seen... "atomic cyborg aka fists of steel"! but if you haven't seen "atomic cyborg", then i'm sorry, but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one. and on a side-note: i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station. even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.

elvira(cassandra peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. after she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff, elvira goes to england to pick it up, hoping it will be some money. but to her horror, elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house, her dog and a cookbook. elvira decides to settle in the house anyways, but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features, she will not be able to live in peace. all the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her, and with elvira's outrageous attitude and looks, everyone better watch out, because elvira is on fire! i really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to watch get elvira into all these adventures, she's just great. the whole movie puts you into a halloween mood, sure, it's silly and the jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure to watch it. i would give elvira, mistress of the dark 8/10

i suck at gratuitous boob references, so i'm just going to write a plainly flat (no pun intended) review. i love elvira, not in a "i'm-going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical" way, but suffice to say i think she rocks. the movie is played like a 50's horror film only alot more fun, look for the "leasurely stroking of the ankle" reference to know what i mean. what relay shines through in the movie is elvira's (or should that be cassandras) absolute charm. i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8, and have seen it contless times since.. i realy should get around to buying a copy, the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear. if any other fans of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel free.p.s another great performance from edie mcclurg (chastedy pariah) an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.

when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny. basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go. but its not all that easy. in this movie you will come across hilarious humor, a witch, a book of spells/recopies, a mentally challenged uncle and a dog. you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie. hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0.... no i'm totally joking ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh, you will scream and you may just be offended.love yours truly: dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it@hot mail.com if you wanna

this film is fun, if your a person who likes a good campy feature film every now and then. by no means is this movie fine cinema, but if you dont take things too seriously, and can laugh at yourself once in a while, elvira is a good frownbuster.

there are two things that i like about elvira, and they're both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up: her wit and her talent. a movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention. looking like a combined clone of morticia adams and anna nicole smith, she inherits a distant relative's estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult. the comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling. it's mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels. my favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary. the ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the bradys, but the las vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie.

elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies, it has every thing you would want in a film, like great one liners, sexy star and a outrageous story! if you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest films made. i can't wait till her new movie comes out!

what can one say about elvira that hasn't already been said in the world's press? the classic comedienne that is elvira delivers in her first full-length big budget comedy masterpiece.from the very first movie frame thingy, elvira packs an acting punch that clearly says film great....eat your heart out, bette davis! see a forlorn elvira, see an excitable elvira, see a jealous elvira, see a murderous elvira. you can do nothing but marvel at her acting prowess!at the heart of this comedy masterpiece is elvira's desire for las vegas show stardom. despite putting "the boob back in the boobtube" as a horror hostess (with the mostest), elvira finds the small screen constrictive emotionally....and physically! nuff said, she packs up her kitbag and heads east....a hotdog in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer outlining her inheritance 'windfall' in the other.i've seen this movie so many times, i can almost recite it verbatim....(verbatim would just be showing off)!grab a copy, laugh yourself silly, learn the lines....why she didn't win the best actress oscar for this role is beyond me.

i think that this movie is very fun and horror. i love elvira and i like this movie. it's very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success, because it very funny like a first part. i also regret that besides of this movie i have no seen cassandra peterson in other films.i think that she is amazing actress with big...potential. i hope that ii'll see her in future in the third part of elvira's adventures. cassandra peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. you can rely on me. what can i more add? this is cool and classical movie!

ok, i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don't know why. i haven't seen it since, but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film - again i don't know why. but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes.comedy is hard - much harder than any drama. doing it right makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? steve martin, pay attention, you are falling in this category again for some reason.elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly. done at a quick pace, with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the philedelphia story, it entertains from start to finish. brain donors is another that fits right in this category (sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes).one point of contention - the ending. it seems the writers/director had no idea how to finish a comedy. the ending tries to be a love story, somewhat undermining the quirky fast-paced dialogue up to that point. then there is the "tassle" scene. whereas this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock. one more rewrite for the ending was needed.this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail. but if you don't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you, you'll laugh, i guarantee it.

elvira mistress of the dark is just that, a campy concoction of fun, sex appeal, horror and comedy all poured into a low cut black gown and toped with a sky high black bouffant hair-do. this movie is sure to delight any fan of elvira's. it takes you upclose and personal with elvira and probes deep into her...um past revealing her enormous... ancestry.the movie takes you on a ride with elvira as she goes from tv horror hostess with the mostess to her home town of fallwell mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased great aunt. where she encounters a stuffy town, a studly cinema owner, a creepy great uncle who seems to be after her for more than her good looks. a slew of high school kids that immediately love her, and a town board who are will do anything to get her out of town, even if it means burning her at the stake! watch elvira woo the kids, stalk the stud, avoid her creepy great uncle and thumb her nose at the stuffy uptight 'preservatives' who have no kind words for her, in elvira mistress of the dark!as elvira would say "i guarantee it'll be a scream! (screams in background) whoa! good thing i didn't say it'd be a gas!"

this has to be one of my favourite flicks, unlike the weak 'elvira's haunted hills'...anyway i love the way the movie is a goth/com 'wizard of oz' story...elvira is a goth dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch (elviras aunt morgana)...she inherits a "ruby" ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad warlock (her uncle)...she befriends four characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow. there is a show down with her uncle (the wicked witch of the west) where elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him. in the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination las vegas (dorothy's home in kansas).there are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie...she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters. elvira: "youe must be aunt em, and you must be uncle remus....there's no place like home, there's no place like home!" bad uncle vinny: "i'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!"there is a sign that elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of kansas.but aside from this, the fact that one of the sequences she "ripped off, um...i mean was inspired by flashdance" is pure genius...and if you don't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her "very 80's" las vegas show then you haven't got a camp bone in your body...this movie is a cult/camp classic

this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast... i mean best! the story (co-written by cassandra peterson, elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira's wit and charm. the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell, massachusetts (where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council. she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (patty) who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira. and, later in the movie, she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings.this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. in the end elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.i've seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it! there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie. a review will not do justice to the actual movie, so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made! meanwhile, i wish you ''unpleasant dreams!''

those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson's alter-ego elvira, then this is a good place to start."elvira, mistress of the dark" starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message. it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will. anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money.unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of fallwell, massachusetts. having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down, she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. the town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her, the women hate her, and the men lust after her (although trying to remain moral pillars of the community). her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent (w. morgan sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock.the film is actually pretty funny, with peterson a.k.a. elvira using her "endowments" and sexiness as a joke ("and don't forget, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things... i mean the thing with two heads"). especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah, the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line, but ends up looking ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). deserves a peek (the film, not her boobs, of course).

ok, this movie is stupid. i mean that in a good way though.it was stupid on purpose, and was one of the better "stupid" movies i've seen. the jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me. the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. there is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine.elvira's character is the focus here.she is lovable and adorable.cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, stunning. few men could disagree with that. the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie.i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies.

elvira, mistress of the dark (1988)directed by: james signorellistarring: cassandra peterson, w. morgan sheppard, daniel greene, and edie mcclurgplot: elvira (cassandra peterson) quits her tv show and heads to the small christian town fallwell, massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance, hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas. unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle, and a magic cookbook. while in fallwell, elvira tries to make money, breathe some life into the teenagers, win the heart of a stud (daniel greene), avoid being burned at the stake, and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (w. morgan sheppard), who is planning to use the book to end the world.my thoughts: i love both cassandra peterson and her alter-ego elvira. she is a very successful, beautiful, and funny woman and as elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. in this movie, her charms are put to good use.i loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. you got elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous 'twins', and she's in a christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. this also makes her love story with bob (daniel greene) a lot more entertaining.w. morgan sheppard is equally great as elvira's uncle/nemesis vincent, out to steal the book to use it for evil. he has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from elvira.what really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel. i hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film, and any fan of roger corman b-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film.if you love elvira, you will love this flick. also check out elvira's haunted hills.

"elvira, mistress of the dark" is a sort of "harper valley p.t.a." with touches of the supernatural. elvira (cassandra peterson) walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station's owner gets fresh with her. she's now relying on a las vegas show to carry her through, but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started. things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt's death, which then takes elvira to massachusetts for the reading of the will. a house in need of repairs, a dog, and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt, and again it seems elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the las vegas show. the adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for elvira. only the local hunk (daniel greene), and a group of teenagers will befriend her. elvira's uncle "vinnie" (w. morgan sheppard), presses to make a deal with elvira for the cookbook, but elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and a couple very effective casseroles. elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power. elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old charge of witchcraft, and the showdown between her and her uncle. the plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace. "elvira, mistress of the dark" is full of cute, gross, bawdy, and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs, and parodies. the film's touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. it is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers; including edie mcclurg, and jeff conaway (of "grease.") there are also nice special effects. many people (including myself) wondered if the elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is delightfully, yes!

i don't doubt that the critics panned this movie, especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative. this is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of abbot & costello or more recently don knotts. it won't shake the world or change movies forever. what it will do is entertain. when all is said & done that's the most important thing anyway. watch this movie & forget your troubles. it even has a simple & kind moral message at no extra charge. i always loved elvira's tv show when i lived in la. she did not really steal her schtick from vampira any more than vampira did from the original, theda bara. this sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best; & cassandra peterson does it best. long live elvira; we need more of these kind of movies. there are never enough. the villain, william morgan sheppard, was also excellent. he exudes a wonderful refined malice. i could find no technical faults. the execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets. my profound compliments to the director,james signorelli,& all his crew.

this isn't the best bigfoot ever made, but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies, mostly showing on the sci-fi channel, this is quality stuff. it has some action, some humor, decent f/x and bigfoot. cg is used, but so are some practical f/x, which i like.overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horror/sci-fi and need a fix. it's better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled.the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. expect a bit of a lul as the characters are "developed", but know that things will pick up. if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two.

"sasquatch hunters" actually wasn't as bad as i thought.**spoilers**traveling into the woods, park rangers charles landon, (kevin o'connor) roger gordon, (matt latimore) brian stratton (david zelina) spencer combs, (rick holland) and his sister janet, (stacey branscombe) escort dr. helen gilbert, (amy shelton-white) her boss dr. ethan edwards, (gary sturm) and assistant louise keaton, (juliana dever) to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area. when they make camp, the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area. when members of the group start to disappear, they start to wander through the woods to safety. it's discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings, and the team band together to survive.the good news: this wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half-way point, when the creature attacks. that is a masterful series of scenes, as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature, and the suspense throughout the entire play-out is extremely high. the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts, heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance. also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off-screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly. they really do add much to make this part so creepy, as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard. it's quite effective, and works well. it's quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace, as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action. one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing. as a man is running through the forest from the creature, he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it. raising his hands to holler to them for help, the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily. it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing.the bad news: there was only a couple things to complain about here, and one is a usual complaint. the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi, which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might've had. the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen. it's so distracting that it's a shame a little more work wasn't put into it. i've complained about this one a lot, and is something that really should be done away with, as it doesn't look that realistic and is quite fake. another big one is the off-screen kills in here. very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away, and then finding the bloody body afterward. it's quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward. otherwise, i don't really have much of a problem with this one, as everything else that's usually critiqued about this one didn't really bother me, but it is called on for others beyond this stuff.the final verdict: i kinda liked this one, but it's still not the best sasquatch movie ever. it's not supposed to be taken seriously, and if viewed that way, it's actually quoit enjoyable. fans of these films should give this one a look, and those that like the sci-fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well.rated r: graphic language, violence and some graphic carcasses

rented the movie as a joke. my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters. it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better. no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant. i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well. "thanks for the jeep, tom!" whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made. in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy.

this is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate. it has good acting, lots of gore, and a decent plot. one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and pumpkinhead. it's obvious that the budget was not all that big, but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors, which seems to be lacking in a lot of today's big budget special effects-filled films. the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work. there are no wasted scenes, so the film's length is a bit short. in addition, it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would be very interesting as well. so grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one.

somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like u.f.o, troma and beneath them lie seduction cinema.seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed, non-hardcore erotic movies. it has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star misty mundae. i say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show masters of horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget s.c efforts which forces the company to find a new identity. but back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world.the gorgeous misty mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father. at the school she meets her absurdly hot room-mate played by ruby larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress (barbara joyce) has other plans. in typical s.c style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances. ms. larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views misty as a tasty meal and darian caine makes a welcome (though brief) appearance as satan. this is the sort of film that jess franco would crank out in the 70s (although this one does not have the hardcore sex that franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales) and fans of that madman's work would be wise to give this one a go.to me, as a long time zero budget cinema fan (and troma worshiper), i came across the seduction cinema films through their parody films (playmate of the apes, who wants to be a erotic billionaire) but i actually prefer their more original works. you either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films. for me the most obvious thing that unites these no-budget movies is a real sense of fun. these low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland, by the numbers, studio efforts that load up the multiplexes.if you have never seen a seduction cinema film either this or sin sisters (featuring both of the mundae sisters) are excellent choices to begin with. this one is a fun, fast paced film (although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old) and the dvd is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings, a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening. i do recommend you pass on the disc's bonus feature, the first film by director, as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing.

why am i so convinced there's actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere? i saw the film again this year as i am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying - there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed. they kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at eel marsh house for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him. mr. bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in the film where kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless - kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge, not the child. i am sure i've seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier. have i just imagined this?

the woman in black was a british made for tv movie which was first broadcast on the bbc on christmave eve of '89, and again in '92. i believe it made a round on american tv on a&e. it was released on vhs in britain in the early 90's but went out of print. a u.s. company released it on dvd later, but that version also sold out. according to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won't be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay.i first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out. i found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. it's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the dvd says, "made in canada," ha ha. but it's a good copy, and you can't really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes.i love the movie. it's a period piece set in the 1920's, with all the very authentic and quaint british settings of that time. the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. for the most part, the movie is very low-key, but effective and scary. there is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. it's a chilling classic styled ghost movie. the movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color. without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, i'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem. for me, it places itself as one of my all time favorites.

yes, a true classic! this is what british drama is all about,realism and the minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). i last saw this drama when it was last screened on british terrestial tv in 1994. it truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot,no big names but non-the-less great acting.sadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon.i myself recently acquired the woman in black on vhs,so now once again i shall be able to enjoy this truly great british drama. you should try and enjoy it too!mark r. horobin

the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects. it's scary, suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life. i first saw this on the tv back in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume turned up, it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life. i managed to get hold of a copy, and now, i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members, who have no idea what they're in for, and all i can do is laugh with glee. as for the film:it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps, who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - mrs. alice drablow. this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story. but then, arthur attends the funeral, and from that scene on, we do not feel safe. we are constantly on edge and biting our nails, and that goes on for the next hour or so, until the final, thrilling finale.a warning to all new viewers though: do not watch this alone...

a young solicitor from london, arthur kidd is sent to a small coastal town of crythin gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow mrs drablow. while attending her funeral, a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention. supposedly drablow lived a reclusive life, and locals kept pretty quiet about her. after this he heads to mrs drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide. there he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house, and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes. now can mrs drablow's belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about.often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and i can see their point. but only in doses does it draw upon tag. yes, from what you can gather i was left a 'little' under-whelmed, despite really liking it. i was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature, but that's probably it expecting. mainly i had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller 'the changeling'. when you hear so many good things, it's sometimes hard not get caught up with it.anyhow what the british tv presentation of "the woman in black" effectively does is bring out a truly old-fashion, slow burn spine-tingling premise driven by its moody locations, disquieting atmosphere and first-rate performances. subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story (adapted off susan hill's novel of the same name), as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist. little seems to happen, and can feel drawn out, but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard. whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black. who mostly appears as a background figure, it's ultimately creepy. she might not appear all that much, but when she does. talk about unnerving! that also goes for that downbeat conclusion. pauline moran, who plays the woman in black, competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning. a pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you. she's a spirit you don't want to cross paths with, yet alone let her see you. an accomplished performance by a marvelously moody adrian rawlins as the solicitor arthur kidd does hold it all together. in support are solid turns by bernard hepton, david daker, clare holman and david ryall.drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn, time-worn victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear. director herbert wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well-judged contriving. instead of going out to shock us, some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won't let go. the sound effects are masterfully used, by surrounding and disorienting the air. rachel portman's harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you.this rarity made-for-television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook-fest. it might not share much new to the sub-genre, but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse.

this is a plain old spooky ghost story. i showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were kept spellbound until the ending! no blood or gore- just good old fashioned suspense. it starts out right from the beginning, and builds and builds. the ending is a real twist that caught me unawares. well directed and well acted. it is also a "period piece"- set in the 1920s- which added to the atmosphere. i was so impressed i got the book by susan hill from amazon. the movie follows the book rather closely. it's a shame it's not readily available on dvd. my copy is vhs. this along with "haunted" are probably two of the best ghost stories i've ever scene. which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes "in your face" gore any day!

...........as i was when i saw this movie) i will never watch this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! as i said, i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us; the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book.all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidd's bed, although, just before that there is something that also frightened us, which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow, and he hears a child's voice say "it's for you". that scene still haunts me to this day, nearly 7 years after i saw the film.if you are easily scared, avoid this film!!!!!!!!

...on stage, tv or in a book, 'the woman in black' is an outstanding ghost story. other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film, but i thought i would add my belated little review too. the made-for-tv movie has a deliberately slow first act, which chronicles the main character arthur as he goes about his business as a solicitor in 1920s london. i can understand why this might not appeal to all palates. nevertheless, for me, i love this british-style of storytelling similar to any of the bbc's "ghost story for christmas" adaptations of the great m.r. james' work. in the second act, the ghost story kicks in as arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss, to tidy up the affairs of a deceased client. the third act relentlessly builds up to a spine-tingling conclusion... as a londoner, i have seen the play. i own the book, dvd-r and have the unabridged audio book on my ipod, too. what is sure for me, 'the women in black' on any medium is a ghost story with few equals. it is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 dvd release.

a young solicitor in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client. when he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked. to speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home, a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day. once there he sees visions of a woman in black, is she real or imaginary,he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes, these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified. atmospheric tv adaptation of a famous play by susan hill, that spends it first third building up its characters, before moving to the creepy country house, its poor colour contrast give away its tv roots immediately, this really should have been in black & white, but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments, still though after waiting so long to see it i must say i was sadly just a little underwhelmed.

i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene. i remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation i might add (to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england!) when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same, of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too. this is in my opinon the scariest film ever made, hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit pony and trap (crap), pardon the pun. what is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams, blokes as well! even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene, and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark!!!!

there is nothing remotely scary about modern "horror" which is an insult to the word "horror". freddie vs jason, the scream movies, cabin trash, and especially stephen king's infantile attempts - he's recycled every story from the monkey's paw to whatever, often in the same story - at horror in both writing and on film (except for kubrick's version of the shining which actually was scary, unlike king's books which are as frightening as my big toe - the left one, which still has the nail.but the woman in black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. this is the way it should be done; the director creates tension, and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face. then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close. he's learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror - val lewton (original cat people) and robert wise (a val lewton disciple and director of the haunting and the body snatcher), jacques tournier (another val lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film, not the gross rubbish raimi did (gross isn't scary, folks, it's just gross), and lewis allen (the uninvited), and of course jack clayton's turn on henry james the innocents, and the way the master of suspense, hitchcock, can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow-building and burning period piece like under capricorn.ten stars...

the first and only time i saw the woman in black was i think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on tv back in 1989. it was christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. i was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father!.there are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie, so every creak, thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there's no distraction. another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on. this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door!a superb ghost story, i've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on tv i cant believe the bbc has deleted it after (to my knowledge) only one showing!

how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie? all... when it comes to actually scaring people. this movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer, and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this. all who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie... it is the best of it's kind.

i gave this film an 10/10 with some reluctance as it's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years. the sheer menace on the woman in black's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread. i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did disturb me for years. i'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too. so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board, this really is incredibly powerful stuff. i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not, but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people. i haven't seen it since i was 10 and i'm tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights. i can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly, but i think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's greatest weapon and that we, as viewers, are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely. it's remarkable that other viewers' feelings are so unanimous.i've also seen the stage play, which was an excellent production...but nothing can compare to this.

most horror movies are in fact horrible movies. they get to be same ol'-same ol'. same ol' pack every minute with some cheap thrill (usually 'splatter') and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects. one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience. for instance, i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second. it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended, it grew roots.subtlety can be more terrifying. less is more. i first saw 'the woman in black' on the a&e channel. after flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it. this movie almost has the feel of a 'masterpiece theater' production. that was fine with me, i've always preferred british tv & movies anyway.most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced. but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility. the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy. the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable. hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc. hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity.the woman only makes about five appearances in the film. most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright. if she appeared too often, it could've cheapened the mood that gets set. however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we're led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible. the scene where she 'visits' arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror.this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made. i have a copy of 'the haunting', 'the changling' and a zillion more. i haven't seen anything that tops 'the woman in black' yet although i'm still looking. this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i'd see her staring through my window, etc. maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate. this is how a really great horror film should be. like a lafanu novel, the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it, she's squeezing the life out of you and then it's too late.closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen... and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print. i just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie. it's a major prize in my collection. now i'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama.

this film gave me nightmares for months and i'm 17. this is the scariest movie ever made! that is no exaggeration!! i saw this movie at school in english lessons and no one else was scared which amazed me. after reading other reviews i'm glad i'm not the only person who found this so scary!!

i saw this on tv so long ago that i can't remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scariest, most unnerving films i've ever seen. there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so that you feel (like the solicitor hero), unsure whether its just imagination or not. it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching. "production values" be hanged, good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film, actors, locations/sets, music, attention to detail, and ...imagination. a real gem.

well-done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way. the story unfolds slowly, building atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black. you won't forget her once you've seen her. no gore, no knives, no hockey masks--just a well-constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out.

i first saw this movie here in the u.k. in december 1989 when central tv broadcast it. i still have the video tape, although worn out (over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it!). anyway, i remember coming home that night, grabbing a christmas tipple, switching the lights out and watching what was advertised as a 'christmas ghost story'. even now i remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on my neck standing on-end... i have seen some comments on the movie which say it's not this and not that...i think those people get scared by friday 13th and the like, stalk and slash rammel, which are laughable. this is a 'traditional' ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects...no swearing, no blood, no gratuitous sex scenes, no chainsaws or guns etc...so how refreshing!!!! it's atmospheric. if you like chilling horror, well written, well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. i like the original horrors; only last night i saw the original haunting and that is a superb movie. very atmospheric again - and so is the woman in black. the end of the movie differs to the book, but still very good. i recommend it. try it...you *will* like it if you like traditional ghost stories...so...turn off the lights, turn up the fire, lock the doors, grab a drink...and enjoy... :)

i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype. i was surprised at the resilience of the ghost's image in my mind the next day, and the day after that. i've watched it 3-4 times, and each time i appreciate it even more. the settings are gorgeous, the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects, the marsh long shots, and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss. the main hero is so likable and good natured, that he is easily sympathized with. to the person who complained that there wasn't enough 'spark' in this film, i'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person. it is a fairly slow paced film, with an unusual amount of time being spent ,pre and post ghost attack, on developing his character with family and work life. spoilers discussion/i especially liked the turning point, when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost. he describes the woman in black, and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back, because after all, what harm had she done to him? the other man says, "you can't go back... alone!" and lends the hero his dog. the cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief, with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room.the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. the woman shows up in mid shot at the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church, and is also not shy or bound to the house. this is all in the very beginning. another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence, watching the funeral. as the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. the older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. crreeepy... usually ghosts are hidden in shadows, haunting specific locales or people. as has been mentioned, the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening, and i feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified. the ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house. or perhaps he was marked no matter what, by saving the gypsy girl. the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable, and really fills the role well. i have been spreading the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film, and it is reassuring to see others feel the same. i can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece, especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype.i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man. whew.. i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the changeling, aaww yeah. any other films to recommend?thanks,

whilst i have loved haunted house movies such as amityville and poltergeist, this made for tv adaption of susan hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of hollywood.with a brilliant cast (many of which star in heartbeat and other tv dramas), great acting, and fantastic setting (which portrays 1920's life convincingly), it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost story.herbert wise did not need blood, violence, or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience. using your own imagination, the woman in black is a figure of fear and dread, and whose presence is never absent once she first appears.the main character arthur kidd, a solicitor, learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate. the widow dies and arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities, which may haunt him for some days. some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic, particularly the locked room which opens itself, which turns the generator off and closes arthur in darkness. the film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in arthurs shoes, and his efforts to shake this ghost off. the writer puts many chilling additions into the story, an example being the tin soldier's re-appearance. one is eager to learn the meaning of it all. the fact we never really learn that much about the widow, leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettling.the widow for the most part, looks vicious and intimidating. the scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me, a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind  having been on such properties myself i can appreciate how isolating this is. and the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things i've seen, one i don't wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives. i have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep.the woman in black is a great tv movie and a lost gem. i agree to some extent the internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of £50 on it, but i think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these over-exposed. i think it's still brilliant and fantastically acted and i consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century.

i saw this film on television years ago, but here several years after, i wake up in the morning, and still remember her face.this film is the most profoundly terrifying film i have seen.

spectacular horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it. the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish, the score is chilling, but the best about the movie is it's performances. it's rare to get scared by performances and this movie's solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor.the story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes. though the woman in black does not have much screen time, she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes. the dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that's when it becomes really scary. if you have the chance, watch this on theater it's a totally different experience but as scary as this movie.this is one of the best ghost movies ever and it's directed for people that want to get scared.

i love ghost stories in general, but i particularly love chilly, atmospheric and elegantly creepy british period-style ghost stories. this one qualifies on all counts. a naive young lawyer ("solicitor" in britspeak) is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly, deceased woman's estate. it's the 1920s, a time when many middle-class brits go to the seaside on vacation for "their health." well, guess what, there's nothing "healthy" about the village of crythin gifford, the creepy site of the elderly woman's hulking, brooding victorian estate, which is located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh. when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl (none of the locals will help the endangered tot -- you find out why later on in the film), he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. she is no filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. the viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame. as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he's reading through legal papers, you expect to see the woman in black at any moment. when the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house, the camera snakes in on him and you think she'll pop up there, too. waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail-bitingly suspenseful. we've seen many elements of this story before(the locked room that no one enters, the fog, the naive outsider who ignores the locals' warnings) but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new-seeming and compelling ghost story. watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black. . .

i really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films. if ismail merchant and james ivory had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one, save for the lack of an internationally known, top drawer cast. this is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn, and you don't even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers. bravo to director herbert wise, writers susan hill and nigel kneale, top production design by jon bunker, art direction by john ralph and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though i'm living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st century. i gave it a "9" out of "10" because with the production and budget constraints of television, they really pulled of a great show.

every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror,diamonds are crafted, and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance. this is no less than a diamond!! this is a film brimful of eeriness,chilling anticipation, and dark atmosphere, and i think it's safe to say, one of my favourite horror films of all time! and of course it contains probably the single most, flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror! every time i see the film, and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen, i try to remember exactly when i will be frightened out of my wits, but it never fails to happen; i never get it right, and i find myself as terrorized as the first time i saw it!! now, it must be said, to scare a jaded horror fan like that, that is nothing short of pure perfection. unlike the americans, the brits know their subtleties, they take pride in the art of acting, they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent story, and the creepiness(in this case)of suggestion and anticipation. every single element is impeccable, from the set pieces, the acting, the story, to the menacing atmosphere. pauline moran surely could make the devil whimper, that's for sure!! as an end note, if you for some demented reason don't like this piece of insanity, then you honestly don't know what horror is all about, and frankly do not deserve to know it either. thank you!

this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it.my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in '92. i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs.she was saying something like "don't let her get me" or something like that. i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she'd been watching the woman in black.so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me. it scared the s*** out of me. i've been immune to horror films since watching this!

the woman in black (1989) is a tv adaptation of susan hill's modern classic ghost story, published only a few years earlier than the film was made. sadly, this film has not been released on dvd, and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs. it's availability is in direct contrast to it's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films. the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow, who died on her isolated marshland estate. what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death, and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest. the story is told in a subtle but concise way, never being self-indulgent, flashy or over-expositional. the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach, but it's just what the story needs, and why it works so well. it's what you don't see that scares. having said that, there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual, and it works to perfection. i watched this film during the day, and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later. if you love being terrified, do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black.

"the woman in black" is easily one of the creepiest british ghost stories ever made.a young solicitor,after arriving in a small town to handle a dead client's estate,is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black.the film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the frights are calculated for and deliver the maximum effect possible.the action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing.the acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times.so if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a look.i dare anyone to watch "the woman in black" alone at night with the lights off.highly recommended.10 out of 10.

film dominated by raven-haired barbara steele, it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle, seeking blood. steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead pre-date romero's night of the living dead shamblers, unifying them in my mind.i don't see the connection between this film and the haunting, which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present. la danza macabre is a b-movie without pretention, daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences. there's no such draw to haunting's overwrought claire bloom. the comparisons to the haunting are superficial.and no, this movie does not need to be remade. not only is it a product of the sixties, but the large percentage of talentless cretins in hollywood cannot fathom macabre's formula for terror. that formula is based on one overriding factor: good writing. low-grade classics like castle and corman's poe films with r. matheson and tourneur's out of the past share a commonality of strong writing. it's simple. get a real writer like richard matheson or steve mcquarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess. besides that, let hollywood attempt some original material for a change, and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past.

i saw this film when i was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parent's basement on a saturday night. it was being shown on "chiller theatre," a regular fright feature that i watched religiously as a young 'un. now, i have seen many old horror films thanks to chiller theatre, but none ever stuck with me like "danse macabre," a.k.a. "castle of blood." i am 51 now, and only last year was i fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent, quality dvd edition of this wonderfully shudder-inducing supernatural classic, having thought i'd never manage to see it again. i have already watched it four more times, and cannot seem to get tired of it.they just don't make spook films like this one anymore. haunted catacombs and mist-enshrouded graveyards just don't work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day. anyway, this one has edgar allen poe and barbara steele, deliciously shadowy, cobweb-wrap'ed haunted castle sets, restless spirits re-enacting their deaths... and a wickedly ironic ending.imo, this one's right up there with robert wise's "the haunting," "the innocents" (with deborah kerr), and the more recent "the others."

`castle of blood' (aka `castle of terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson. exquisite black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart. only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between elizabeth (barbara steele) and alan (georges rivière) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie.while visiting england, edgar allan poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to count blackwood. recognizing the great writer, alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with poe. during the course of the conversation, poe reveals that all of his stories are true. incredulous, alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. count blackwood offers to bet alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in blackwood's castle, a night following halloween when the dead walk. alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.unlike mario bava's overpraised `black sunday,' (aka `the mask of satan'), `castle of blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the 60s.it's a pity the only version of this film i've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. even so, it is well worth seeing, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with christina ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth. watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with robert wise's `the haunting'.

i first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television. scared the hell out of me. but then, i was a teenager back in those days, not as jaded about films as i am now.castle of blood (aka: danse macabre) is a fine example of the 60s italian horror genre, along with mario bava's black sunday(1960), curse of the living dead (aka: kill baby kill) (1966) and mario caiano's nightmare castle (1965). if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing, then check these out as well. i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period.i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and it's a great improvement over that old pan-and-scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years. it adds a couple of minutes of dialog (in french) that don't really add much to the movie as whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cuts. unfortunately the dvd doesn't really offer any extras beyond stills from the film.one flub i noticed was in the opening scene, seeing the smoke-effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn's front door. i guess the editors didn't catch it at the time, or maybe they didn't care, but it is something i didn't notice the first time. that's the wonders of dvd. you get to see all the flubs, mistakes and details that weren't apparent the first time around. but no matter.but no matter, it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter

italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960's - and this is certainly one of them! the first thing you will notice about danse macabre is the style of the film. shot in beautiful black and white, and due to director antonio margheriti's use of lighting; the film almost looks like it could be a german expressionistic horror film. this, coupled with the horror-filled plot line ensures that danse macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror. of course, the fact that the beautiful barbara steele appears in the film doesn't harm matters - and the good news continues as, in this film, she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous. the plot is very aware of the time in which this was released, and so incorporates the great edgar allen poe. we follow alan foster, a writer who accepts a bet from poe himself and lord blackwood that he can't spend an entire night in the latter's creepy old castle. everyone that has spent the night there previously has died...and our hero is about to meet the previous wager-takers! nowadays, horror films don't tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn't much beauty left in the genre. it is refreshing, therefore, to see this film. many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful - from the female side of the couple wearing just a see-through skirt, to my personal favourite - a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door. this my first antonio margheriti film, and even after seeing just this one; it's obvious that he was one of italy's premier directors. also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co-written by another of the italian greats; django creator sergio corbucci. the plot can meander a little too much at times, but there's always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring - and the fact that it is always intriguing, even when the plot slows down, ensures the same thing. the way that danse macabre utilises the 'haunted house' theme is both well done and original, and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible. on the whole, fans of italian and/or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem!

castle of blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in italy in the 60s. the film has all of the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and barbara steele. steele makes most any film worth seeing.the story concerns a haunted castle. people have visited, but none have returned. our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. but, the night he visits is a special night. it's the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths.the only flaw i see in the movie is the running time. it almost feels padded. there is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens. our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest. but once he does find something, the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable.castle of blood is a definite must for steele fans and fans of italian gothic horror in general.

when american author edgar allan poe visits london, he is approached by british journalist alan foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar wager. not believing poe's assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience, foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the blackwood's haunted castle. once installed in the abandoned castle, foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men, and a doctor of metaphysics - who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths! the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror, i was mesmerized the entire time. i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful. babs steele is undeniably beautiful. the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing. the topless scene threw me for a loop, as i was not expecting it. it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancement, because this movie looks damn fine for its age, and it's the uncut international version, to boot. this is the movie responsible for me starting a babs steele and klaus kinski collection.

i've watched this movie a number of times, and found it to be very good. this movie is also known as "castle of terror", "coffin of terror", and "dance macabre". barbara steele, is her usual beautiful/creepy self. george riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a good deal of tension throughout. the camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, isn't bad. this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. i have the dvd uncut version, which is far superior to the edited tv version. grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, settle back and enjoy. john r. tracy

this complicated story begins fairly simply, with an english journalist accepting a wager from edgar allen poe and his friend lord blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted blackwood castle. once there, the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors, until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room. he sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard, and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful elizabeth blackwood. she informs him with an ambiguous charming/eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night...the night of the dead. thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night. spoiler ahead: it probably won't surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely elizabeth is actually a ghost. this doesn't prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple. this is a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, the spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence ( though both have been toned down in the version most americans have seen over the years.) the alluring, captivating barbara steele is the main reason to see it. she has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you've ever seen in the movies. recommended!

i originally saw this movie as a boy at the old rialto theatre as part of a saturday afternoon matinée triple bill which also featured vincent price's "last man on earth" and mario bava's "nightmare castle." i had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards! though i didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre. no wonder i was so scared! though all three films frightened me, it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact.it was the first on the bill. i didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie. that's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes (the unedited runs 87minutes). but despite this, the dark creepy atmosphere (complete with ruined castles, fog enshrouded cemeteries, shadows and cobwebs), gothic set design, strong acting, and suspense (especially the last 20 minutes) scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection. since it was a french - italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in winnipeg. i couldn't quite remember the title (remember i didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless), and to make matters worse, the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles (aka danze macabre, coffin of terror, castle of terror, long night of terror, etc...) and the usa/uk working title "castle of blood" was very generic, similar to dozens of other "b" horror and suspense films, making it illusive. but thanks to the internet and perseverance, i found it at last! what a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years! it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy, but as haunted house movies go, it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as "the haunting," "the innocents" or "black sunday," the film is a fine early effort of italian director antonio margheriti. it stars 60's scream queen icon barbara steele and features a well written screenplay by sergio corbucci about a sceptical writer (georges riviere) who, on a bet, spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story. the hypnotic steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest - as is arturo dominici as dr. carmus, and margarete robsahm as julia.many of the tricks margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere (cobwebs, creaking doors, fog, etc) are bound to seem cliché to a modern audience, but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour. rather than using body counts and special effects, the film creates scares the old fashion way, relying on a good story, stylish direction, fine set production, interesting camera work, and strong acting performances. margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer.the film is not without faults. the pace drags at the beginning of the film (ironically, the 20 minutes i originally missed). this is probably worsened by synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length. though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored - in terms of the intro - it may have been more of hindrance than a help. the english voice dubs are merely passable and, in the restored scenes, the language shifts from english to french (english subtitles provided) which is sure to be annoying to some viewers.however, synapse films deserves kudos for the quality of the print. clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.i enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's italian goth films, or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.rob rheubottom winnipeg, mb canada

if you're a fan of gothic horror, then you're definitely absolutely guaranteed to love this wondrous italian 60's film "castle of blood". we're really talking about creepily creaking doors, eerie portraits that appear to be moving, spontaneously dying candles although there's no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors. speaking in terms of atmosphere and style, this masterful piece of gothic film-making is one of the best out there; just one tiny league below landmarks such as "black sunday", "the three faces of fear" and "curse of the crying woman". the prominent directors duo sergio corbucci ("the great silence", "django") and antonio margheriti ("cannibal apocalypse", "killer fish") are successful in all areas, including a powerful plot (one that is genuinely nightmare inducing), ultra-sinister scenery and filming locations, stylish black and white photography, spine-chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers. barbara steele, starlet of the aforementioned "black sunday" and italian goth-muse number one, shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she's literally surrounded by excellent co-players. one of them, silvano tranquilli, even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author edgar allan poe. the story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager. if he  alan foster  would survive spending one night in the infamous blackwood castle, he receives the astonishing reward of $10 and a newspaper interview with poe. needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds, even for somebody like alan foster who's a firm non-believer in ghosts and vampires. the night starts out great for him, as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams, but gradually he learns that blackwood castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity. i don't know about you, but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time. co-director antonio margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well, because he remade it himself a couple of years later as "web of the spider". that movie had a handful of trumps, like for example the casting of no less than klaus kinski in the role of edgar allan poe, but in general this original is vastly superior. "castle of blood" literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout. this truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances. watch it late at night, preferably alone and in a candle lit room, and you'll get an idea about the true definition of horror.

the dvd for "danaza macabra" (castle of blood) is very odd. that's because parts of the film are in french with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into english from the french. sometimes, characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene! when i tried to get the film to be just subtitled or just dubbed, it made no difference! odd, but still watchable.the story purports to be based on a poe story, though i can't recall which one. in fact, the character of poe appears in the beginning and end of the film--though it didn't look especially like him.a rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home. it seems like an easy bet to win--even if the house is very creepy. however, it can't be that easy, as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died--yet this fool still wants to make the wager! while in the home, he meets lovely barbara steele within and falls madly for her. later, however, he learns that she died more than a decade earlier! how can this be?! i could tell you more about the plot but don't want to spoil any of the suspense. see it for yourself to find out the rest of the story.this film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere. the house, black & white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film. as for the plot, it's interesting--especially because there are many twists and turns--so many that you are wondering just who is and who isn't among the undead by the end of the film.the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed. crazy as it might sound, i felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary.also, parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity. a strikingly beautiful woman appears topless, but it's hardly necessary for the plot.

i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville, kentucky when i was a boy. the scene where dr. carmus finds the gardener's coffin, and the breathing dead body therein, was the scariest part of the movie for me, only intensified by the darkness of the film. i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end, until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood, due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people. sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family. i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery, he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate, where he meets his end. i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers.

this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalist...poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle. well, of course he can, but will he come out unscathed? hard to say with all these strange people that aren't supposed to be there wandering around, including the icy barbara steele. this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english, and switches back and forth a few times. perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost? it's also rather dark and claustrophobic, being that one doesn't see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate, plus there's a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times. this version (on synapse) is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until i saw the topless scene, i guess that might be it. overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white. barbara steele definitely makes the movie too. 8 out of 10.

i have never seen a barbara steele movie that i haven't liked, and have always been a sucker for a good haunted-house story (especially for such wonderful pictures as "the legend of hell house" and the original versions of "the haunting" and "house on haunted hill"), so i had a feeling that "castle of blood" would be right up my alley. and boy, was it ever! this french-italian coproduction, while perhaps not the classic that steele's first horror film, "black sunday," remains to this day, is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric, chilling entry in the spook genre. filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma. the film concerns a journalist who bets one lord blackwood and an author named edgar allen poe that he can spend the night in blackwood's castle on the night of all saints day, when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate. the viewer gets to see these deaths, and they are pretty horrible, for the most part. the film does indeed send shivers up the viewer's spine, and in the uncut dvd that i just watched--thanks to the fine folks at synapse--even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism! and barbara is wonderful in this movie; her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre. her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable. not for nothing has she been called "the queen of horror."

well executed old and very dark house horror. good set-up which includes the character of poe, himself, alluding to the story in a london pub. although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people, it is still most enjoyable. plus we have the delightful and enigmatic barbara steele. there is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout, that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along. dvd originates from us and has a few extras

antonio margheriti's "danza macabra" aka. "castle of blood" of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror, and after mario bava's "la maschera del demonio" (aka. "black sunday") of 1960 and roger corman's "pit and the pendulum" of 1961 (starring the great vincent price) another must-see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures. but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all-time, the screenplay to "danza macabra" was co-written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio corbucci, who directed such ingenious spaghetti western milestones as "django" (1966) and "the great silence" (1968). italy's number 2 in the field (right after mario bava), director antonio margheriti is one of the all-time masters of gothic horror, and "castle of blood" is doubtlessly his greatest achievement. hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting, yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece. when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories, edgar allen poe, in a gloomy london tavern, young journalist alan foster (georges rivière) accepts a bet from a nobleman, that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls' eve. as soon as foster enters the eerie castle, mysterious things start to happen. after a little while, however, he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle, the stunningly beautiful elisabeth blackwood (barbara steele). the mysterious events so far, however, have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears, however...the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood, the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by riz ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison. the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always, i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress. no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele, and no actress ever will. besides steele, the movie's cast contains another stunning beauty, margarete robsahm, and she also delivers a great performance. george rivière's performance as alan foster is great, and the rest of the performances are also very good. "castle of blood" is outstanding in many departments: barbara steele delivers one of her best performances, the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison, the atmosphere is incredibly eerie... the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere, gothic beauty and the art of terror. in short: "castle of blood" is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made, and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre! 10/10

antonio margheriti's "danza macabra"/"castle of blood" is an eerie,atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts.it looks absolutely beautiful in black & white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic vibe.alan foster is an english journalist who pursues an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan poe.poe bets foster that he can't spend one night in the abandoned mansion of poe's friend,thomas blackwood.accepting the wager,foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins!the film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me.the crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable.barbara steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter elisabeth blackwood."castle of blood" is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early 60's.a masterpiece!

i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york. it was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as horror hotel. i just bought this movie on dvd, and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and/or italian and no subtitles are provided. then the other actors respond in english to what was being said. kind of weird. also on the dvd box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb.aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth (barbara steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists. that scene existed in the tv version, but it was very edited. i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. there aren't too many special effects (but herbert's face after julia clubs him is a good one). the creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. she makes the movie a ten!

i spied this short on a dvd of best new zealand shorts, all great but the french doors was amazing. it starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen. just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation, the most spookiest thing happens. eeeekkk, i wanted to stop watching, but i was glued. the films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little, if not any, special effects. it chills you right to the bone. a simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when i was young and dream't up the most improbably but spooky situations. the film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story. it is a quality short that i haven't seen in quite some time. the french doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature, alas it finishes after ten minutes or so. never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more. loved it and well done and thanks for the ride. these new zealanders are really turning out the talent.a new fan.

i must admit i'm a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke. i think its a great horror/sci fi film. colonel steve west (alex rebar) returns to earth after an historical space flight to saturn. while in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease. he wakes up in a hospital bed, he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting! escaping the hospitals supervision, he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town. unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people. he must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive! stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! its up to his old friend dr ted nelson (burr debenning) to find him and try and help him. he has to work alone as his boss general perry (myron healey) wants it kept ultra quiet. nelson can't even tell his wife judy (ann sweeny). however, sheriff blake (micheal alldredge) becomes suspicious as general perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten. i don't really understand why this film gets such negative reviews, what do people expect? anyway, i really like this film. the star of the film are unquestionably rick bakers special make-up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent, and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible cgi makes them even better. writer and director william sachs isn't afraid to use them either, we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well, even now. photography, music and direction are a little bit dull, but professional enough. the script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster, shots of him looking longingly into ted nelsons house, or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently. the ending, set in a large factory of some sort, is pretty downbeat so don't expect any happy ending. which surprised me. also, the script doesn't really do anything with the premise, he just walks around melting and killing, with his friend trying to stop him, maybe a bit too simple. personally i think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion, her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too, it looks and sounds totally ridiculous! you need to see it to believe it! i like this film a lot and recommend it to 70's and 80's horror/sci fi fans. a bit of a favourite of mine.

to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. as a kid in the 50s thats all there was. in 1957 i saw "the first man into space" in a movie theater with my dad. it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. scared the good & plenty right out of me. the memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me. the incredible melting man is almost a re-make only in full glorious color...that is wherever the scenes were well-lit. just gotta love it for what it is......a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises, and that eerie music. bravo !

about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors. i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn't try to find it anywhere. then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought "hey why not" and tried finding it on the internet. eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films. i called my dad over to the computer and said to him" hey dad i've found that creepy film you told me about ages ago!" he smiled at me, turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it. i started off fine...then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving. at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up...it made me jump!:p if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling.great film!

the melting man...a tragic victim of the space race, he perished melting...never comprehending the race had long gone by...!a man (burr debenning) burns his hand on the kitchen stove. but instead of screaming something a normal person would scream, he shouts something that sounds like "aaaaatch-kah!!" this movie you've popped in...isn't a normal movie. you've just taken your first step into the incredible melting man, the famous late-70's gore film featuring rick baker's wonderful makeup effects. baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar, and did this at the same time as his famous "cantina aliens" in star wars. for some strange reason, star wars became a household name, and incredible melting man did not. it might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind-numbingly awful. from the opening credits ("starring alex rebar as the incredible melting man"...that's really what it says!), to the chubby nurse running through a glass door, to the fisherman's head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks, this film provides many, many moments of sheer incomprehensibility. "why did they...but how come he...why are they...?" after a while, you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is--a very entertaining piece of garbage.an astronaut returns to earth in a melting, radioactive condition; he escapes and, his mind disintegrating as well as his body, begins a mad melting killing spree. the authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped, but (probably not wanting to "cause a panic") want him captured as quietly as possible. so they send one guy with a geiger counter after him. wow.storywise, surprisingly little happens during the movie. the melting guy wanders around killing people. a doctor searches for him with a geiger counter. various characters are introduced, ask questions, and leave. eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man, but is shot by a security guard for no reason, after he explains that he's "dr. ted nelson." the melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo. the end.it's so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun, despite a fairly downbeat ending. supposedly, a widescreen dvd release is planned. a very special movie.

thanks to this fungal film i do not want my maypo, can't stomach the thought of maltex or wheatena, and even that granola over there doesn't look so innocent anymore! why wasn't the song "slop time", by the sherrys, used as the theme?

as a collector of movie memorabilia, i had to buy the movie poster for this film which, now that i've finally seen it, has to be the best thing about it. there's nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man. however, there's nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man. at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh. the character of dr. ted nelson has to be the most wishy-washy persona ever brought to the big screen. his dialogue is so trite it's unbelievable! ("it's incredible! he seems to be getting stronger as he melts!)and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to "help" him? if this movie was meant to scare its audience, i think it missed its calling.

astronaut steve west (alex rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of saturn. his comrades are killed instantly, but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones. steve returns to earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer, melting every step of the way, he is tracked by his friend, dr. ted nelson (burr debenning).this is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional. it seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's, and as such, it's a marvelously entertaining movie. that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. we're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything, but is still a gas to watch.writer / director william sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed. i think his pacing is a little off; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go on a little long, but ultimately he delivers solid, schlocky, b-movie goods with a degree of panache. the climax is especially fun.arlon obers' music is enjoyably shuddery (yet also amusingly silly during some moments), and willy curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times. that brings me to rick bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects, which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie, right down to the ultimate final melt.rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and does what he has to do well enough. debenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero, and ann sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife, but myron healey, michael alldredge, and lisle wilson are fine in support. it's also worth it to see folk like cheryl "rainbeaux" smith (doing an appreciable topless shot), janus blythe (of tobe hoopers' "eaten alive" and wes cravens' "the hills have eyes"), and even director jonathan demme in a bit part.this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore, chills, and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere.8/10

first off, anyone looking for meaningful "outcome oriented" cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated, emotive, heartfelt thespians, please leave now. you are wasting your time and life is short, go see the new brangelina jolie movie, have a good cry, go out & buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better, and leave us alone.don't let the door hit you on the way out either. the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young, tv friendly cast & crew, and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects, wakes up in a hospital, and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump. the melting man is played by one alex rebar, who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film. but once he starts oozin' with rick baker's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny, viscous blebs of grease.the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points: there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care, really. it's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it -- one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out. hilarious.the "hero" of the film is played by burr debenning, a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s & 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype; slightly twisted, neurotic, and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused. he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead (or the alien zone) that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma, which is where i suspect this film was made as well. the arid, cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same, and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning ... which also had a sick sense of humor, a tv friendly cast, and some pretty outrageous gore. i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies, as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man's cast.essentially, as others have pointed out, this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects & the inevitable boobs. the movie it probably borrows most of it's ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree. one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man's motivations: he simply goes on a rampage and the movie's drama comes from wondering if he's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness. the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen, rick baker's disgusting effects getting the lion's share of whatever was spent on this.sick, disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer. why can't people have made more movies like these? 8/10

"the incredible melting man" is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! the ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of hammer's "the quatermass xperiment" ...only a thousand times filthier! astronaust steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! in shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. doctor ted nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of rick baker. the melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader! another big advantage is that william sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. the repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you'll miss out on all the campy fun!

seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear.soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy vietnam veteran."trampa infernal" is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot "the zero boys".the film is fast-paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck.unfortunately there is not much gore,so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed.however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look.mexican horror flicks are quite obscure(i have seen only "alucarda" and "don't panic"),so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher.my rating:7 out of 10.highly recommended.

four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear. the motley coed group runs afoul of crazed vietnam veteran jesse (an effectively creepy portrayal by alberto mejia baron), who not surprisingly doesn't take kindly to any strangers trespassing on his terrain. director/co-writer pedro galindo iii relates the gripping story at a steady pace, creates a good deal of nerve-rattling tension, and delivers a fair amount of graphic gore with the brutal murder set pieces (a nasty throat slicing and a hand being blown off with a shotgun rate as the definite gruesome splatter highlights). the capable cast all give solid performances, with especially praiseworthy work by pedro fernandez as the nice, humane nacho, edith gonzalez as the feisty alejandra, charly valentino as the amiable charly, and tono mauri as antagonistic jerk mauricio. better still, both yummy blonde marisol santacruz and lovely brunette adriana vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits. antonio de anda's slick, agile cinematography, the breathtaking sylvan scenery, pedro plascencia's robust, shuddery, stirring score, the well-developed characters, and the pleasingly tight'n'trim 76 minute running time further enhance the overall sound quality of this bang-up horror/action hybrid winner.

i searched for this movie for years, apparently it ain't available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay.four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers. what they find is an ex-vietnam vet gone crazy (he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger). as soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend, she gets killed. after one of the group finds her body, they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight. once the sun comes up, all of them try and make it out, but fall victim one by one.seven bodies, not a lot of gore, but a couple of good murders, especially the girls'deaths. the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways (blown up in car, shot to death, knife through head). overall, infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late 80's. nothing new, just well acted, fast paced and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10.

talk about a blast opening, "trampa infernal" has the coolest opening credits ever! guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary "friday the 13th" theme (tsh-tsh-tsh-ha-ha-ha), the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables. promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher/backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes. two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar. according to a newspaper article, there's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it. the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls. upon arrival, however, it quickly becomes obvious they're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve. after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers, this early 90's mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid. the formula is simplistic but efficient, the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful. the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers, as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. the murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric, which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences, and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood. the forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular. "trampa internal" is a mexican slasher/survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre.

rumour has it that around the time that abba  the multi-award winning swedish disco favourites 's star had reached its zenith, the band grew disillusioned with singing in english and yearned to perform in their native tongue. soon after, problems began to emerge in the onetime-wed locked-watertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent. the band dissolved, albeit unofficially, in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists. although they have never admitted that there's any truth in those rumours, the fact remains that abba would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue. if you want to appeal to the largest money-making media market in the entire world, then you must cater for english speaking audiences.it's amazing for me how such a small island that's located a stone-throw away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most recognised, although not most widely spoken, language in the world. everyone speaks a little bit of english; whether it be simply 'hello' or a common swear word - you'll find an english speaker almost everywhere. pedro galindo obviously didn't agree, because trampa infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget dvd. that's a real shame, because it's actually a decent slasher movie that's a lot better than many of its english-speaking genre compatriots.the film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel. two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown. after some suspense and a couple of near misses, one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously. next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town. nacho and mauricio are fiercest rivals and mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft-spoken opponent, but as of yet he hasn't succeeded.later that night, whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend alejandra and his buddy charly, mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis. he says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect. nacho is at first reluctant because alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness, but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees; much to the distaste of his morally superior partner.they plan to head out to the remote region of filo de caballo, because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear. mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversary.after visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly store-keeper, the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland. hunters become hunted as they learn that the 'bear' is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy. what started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassin.i picked up trampa whilst studying in madrid from a mexican student who lived in the dorm room next-door to me. i remember that the copy i watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled, which meant i never got to see the final scenes. thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection. gallindo's slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot, which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies. it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold schwarzenegger classic predator. this is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepily-masked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panic-stricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniac's playground.despite gallindo's obvious awareness of genre platitudes (the bogeyman even uses a claw-fingered glove a la freddy kruegar); trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template. whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category, the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown. from here on, the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film, which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you. the last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry 'the majorettes', which is not necessarily a good thing.as is the case with many latin films (especially spanish flicks by almodovar and amenabar), trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story, which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewer's throat. over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner. it's a sugar-coated point, but it's handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the feature.trampa may be cheesy, but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers. the killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white valentine-style mask and the attempts at originality just about work. it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy, but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing.

"bread" very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and "night of the living dead" in specific and is constantly inventive. the production values are a little rough at times (it's a student film, after all), but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain. hey -- george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered "dead" video tape, laserdisc and dvd... that should tell you something.

before viewing, please make sure you have seen night of the living dead... this might well be the best 7 minute parody i have ever seen! absurd, crappy 'special effects' (the rope, the rope!!!), and maneating slices of bread... what more do you need???(do not watch this movie while eating bread... you might get scared!)

i just viewed this great good-natured parody of night of the living dead, and i have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent. this movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery, the supposable abandoned house, the basement and the front lawn. what i especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against. c'mon, we know that toasters, toaster ovens and zip-locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread. aside from the cheap acting and voice-overs, this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of night of the living dead, even better than night of the living dead of 1990.i think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread, including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous. another great reason why i love this movie is that, there is no exception as to what bread is evil, bagels are evil and even communions are evil, which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest. i think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread (i.e. the car scene). i think the end is very worth sticking around.even though this is a short and that "night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil, mutant, alien, flesh eating, hellbound, zombified living dead part 2: in shocking 2-d" is debatably another great parody, it's still recommend as a great horror parody done by, what seems to be college filmmakers. i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of night of the living dead and still have respect for the filmmakers. i would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves d-movies and horror parody's, it's just a wonderful little short horror film that's fun to watch and learn.

being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time, and at the same time loving this student film parody, i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews. this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd-pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously. this film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. it is intended to be funny, and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds. especially for those of us who have seen notld 50+ times. watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel, and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody, loaf.

having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons, i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference.though the themes are crusty and stale to today's viewers, it is by no means a crumby waste of time.though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse, the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough.as noted by another reviewer, it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy, sit back and loaf idly through the film.i think this short-bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it.

cashing in on the "demons-meets-clergy" trend of the late '60s/early '70s that most prominently included the triptych of "rosemary's baby," "the exorcist," and "the omen," "the sentinel" is an addition that's just as good (albeit the most overlooked of the lot). in a way, it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of polanski's "the tenant" (which came out the same year) for good measure. a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss-coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale; she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor (the brilliant burgess meredith), plus the other off-center tenants. kept awake by loud noises above her apartment, she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building. from there, director michael winner ("death wish") kicks this supernatural thriller into gear, and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine. aided by a brilliant ensemble cast, a subtle storyline, and excellent makeup fx by dick smith ("the exorcist"), "the sentinel" is a genuinely creepy horror flick.

i'm surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film. the lion's share of the footage in both is identical, but here is where they differ: in one version (the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv), the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the "brotherhood of the protectors", a (fictional) splinter group of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the church. in the other version, which i've seen only once on tv, the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church, meaning the archdiocese of new york (or perhaps brooklyn). also, in the former version, in most of the pertinent scenes, the clerics are referred to as "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say "father" so-and-so but the dubbed audio says "brother" so-and-so. in the latter version, i believe everyone is referred to as "father".in any event, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re-shooting of the other, with all "brotherhood of the protector" scenes re-shot as "archdiocese" scenes, or vice versa. (kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in "godzilla"). i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv, so no, i'm not imagining this. can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film?

wonderful film, one of the best horror films of the 70s. she is realistic settings and atmospheres. as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments. i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency. obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati, is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here.before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment. in the film a good gift because 10 is really well done. raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films. he really impression. excellent film really. i consider a film anthology of years'70.

well, after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo's the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film. the plot was simple, beautiful model alison parker (cristina raines) moves into an apartment building that's a gateway to hell. the sentinel is a down right creepy film, even if it's a bit slow. it's a mix of the omen and rosemary's baby. the acting is fine, and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals. it's a very odd, campy but in the end, i truly believe a great film! one of my favorites from the 70's, even if it's nothing greatly original. it's wacky and extremely creepy! probably one of my all time favorites. 9/10

i had the tv on for a white noise companion and heard" $400 for a fully furnished apartment" so i ran into the tv room expecting another 70's flick and got much more. luckily, i could rewind to the beginning (dvr buffer) and hit the record button to watch it entirely.(cinemax uncut and in hd no less!) aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events, this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. pretty creepy and progressive at times: beverly d'angelo's character masturbates in front of alison parker, played adroitly by cristina raines, parker stabs, in very gory fashion, her father, an explicit menage a trios scene.( don't let the kids watch) the film is totally 70's full of bad clothes(polyester suits and tacky ascots) and decor, bad hair,over bloated music score, and familiar looking cinematography. the cast is excellent, take a second on this film's home page to check it out.it was a surprise to see christopher walken, jerry orbach and jeff goldblum so young. sylvia miles- always wonderfully creepy! enjoy!

ahh, yes, the all-star blockbuster. take a so-so concept, stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin' special effect that the wizards of hollyweird can conjure up, then round up the usual suspects: hot up-and-comers, has-beens, wanna-be's and never-wuzzes, and stick 'em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras. and hope to gawd that some of them aren't too old to remember their lines.leave it to the bishops of box office to apply the concept to horror films at last, as was the case with the post-exorcist thriller the sentinel. novelist jeffrey konvitz decided to try and one-up ira levin's rosemary's baby scenario of creepy (and ultimately satanic) neighbors in a new york brownstone. the result was a controversial best-seller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic, and an equally controversial, top-heavy/star-laden vehicle co-written and directed by death wish's michael winner, but for many unsettlingly different reasons.cristina raines (nashville) plays successful model alison parker, who is pretty much over- stressed and over-worked, (i won't add "overpaid." i mean she is a model, so that would be redundant), not just by her 24/7 schedule, by also by her insistent , 'wanna-get-married- right-now' boyfriend michael (chris sarandon of dog day afternoon and the classic sob.i.g. movie lipstick). one of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place; a big, beautiful brownstone in manhattan which she's able to get dirt-cheap, (that should've been the big red flag - cheap real estate in new york!), from the mysteriously accommodating broker miss logan (golden age screen vet ava gardner, fresh from the storm drain in earthquake.)things seem fine at first, but ah, yes...then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night. and what about the really strange neighbors like gerde (sylvia miles) and sandra (a very early beverly d'angelo), the nice "single friends" (read: lesbians) living together, and kindly old mr. charles chazen (a nicely creepy burgess meredith), who seems maybe a little too concerned with alison's welfare? and that's not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants (you'll never hear the phrase "black and white cat, black and white cake" again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously.) especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse...things really start to go downhill when an apparition-laden nightmare of alison's morphs into a grisly murder, (in one of the movie's most underwear-staining scares), and both alison and michael, with some assistance from alison's bff, jennifer (deborah raffin), begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone's dark origins, as well as the murderous agenda of its other-worldly inhabitants, not to mention alison's connection to them, which as it turns out is anything but coincidental.although there's nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast, which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time, (arthur kennedy, jose ferrer, martin balsam, eli wallach, john carradine, and even early appearances by christopher walken, jeff goldblum and nana visitor!) winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a "tod browning"...by enlisting real-life physically-challenged actors to appear in the sentinel's climactic everything-and-everybody-goes-to-hell sequence, which i guess any ballsy director would do, finding himself unable to access linda blair and a case of green-pea soup. it does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither, knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch. and it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently: live on-set makeup and special effects that don't involve cgi, (which was pretty much non-existent back then.)the sentinel has that kitschy, late-seventies cheese factor, but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gasp-inducing moments like the one mentioned above, not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon, of isolation and things that go bump-and-shriek in the night. after all, what living-single-in- the-big-city person hasn't lain in bed in the dark, and listened intently to the sounds of what they hope is "the building settling?"konvitz followed up the sentinel with an inevitable sequel, the guardian (not to be confused with the william friedkin supernatural thriller namesake), that was never adapted for the screen. =sigh of relief=

michael winner is probably best known for his revenge-themed films, such as "death wish" and "chato's land", but he is equally gifted as a director of occult horror cinema, as "the sentinel" of 1977 proves. "the sentinel", which is based on a novel by john konvitz, who also wrote the screenplay, is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult horror should consider missing. the film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as "rosemary's baby", "the exorcist" or "the omen", but, as far as i am concerned, it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films, and probably even creepier.allison parker (christina raines) is a beautiful young new york model. traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend (chris sarandon), allison is in search for an apartment, and finds a big, incredibly nice one, which is also affordable, in an old mansion in brooklyn. the new apartment, however, comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants. and the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to alice... this may not be an adequate plot synopsis, but i would hate to spoil any of this film's great moments, so i will not give any further plot description. what i will say, however, is that "the sentinel" is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere. the fact that director michael winner and writer john konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome. the film is imaginatively photographed, and the eerie old brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film. as mentioned above, the atmosphere is obscure and creepy, and the film also includes several shock-moments and genuine scares. the film features many sinister and eccentric characters, and the cast is superb. beautiful christina raines is great in her role of allison parker, lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind. chris sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend, a successful lawyer, and the supporting cast includes many big names, such as christopher walken, jeff goldblum, jerry orbach, beverly d'angelo and tom berenger, before becoming really famous. the cast also includes stars like ava gardner, horror icon john carradine, burgess meredith, and, my personal favorite, the great eli wallach as a cynical homicide detective. i've been a great fan of director michael winner for a long time, mostly for films like "death wish" and "chato's land". "the sentinel" is yet another great film in winner's repertoire, and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard-boiled revenge-cinema, but also of atmospheric occult horror. all in all, "the sentinel" is a creepy, intelligent, and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all horror fans!

director / writer michael winner's feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film (although still schlock efficiently catered for), which really does by go unnoticed. sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period, but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material (of good vs. evil) and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive, if somewhat exploitative set-pieces. as a whole it's sketchy, however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang-busters with the scares. actually there's always something going on amongst its busy framework, but it's rather down-played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring, up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation. winner's dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian, however it's the ensemble cast that really holds it together as you try to spot the faces. there's plenty too. some having more to do with the scheme of things than others, but there's no doubts every one of them are committed, despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all. it's interesting to see names like sylvia miles (who's significantly creepy!), beverly d'angelo (likewise), deborah raffin, eli wallach, christopher walken, william hickey (a neat cameo), jeff goldblum, jerry orbach and tom berenger in bit parts. then you got a mild-mannered chris sarandon and movingly gorgeous cristina raines in the leads. offering able support josé ferrer, martin balsam, ava gardner, john carradine, burgess meredith and arthur kennedy. the script does throw around many characters, as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in. however it's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what's really going on here. is there a reason for all of this, and why is it surrounding raines' character? the emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle, as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange/worrying experiences she encounters when she's moves into her new apartment. this is where winner tries to pull out the eerie shades, which projects some icy moments. gil melle was the man responsible for the grand, overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and richard c. kratina instruments the sweeping, scope-like photography.

the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago, by my father, and i've seen it many times since. it always manages to entertain me, while being effectively creepy as well. the flashback scenes are what really made it for me. cristina raines's father running around all creepily, with the two creepy woman, always manages to send chills down my spine. it's your typical good vs evil thing, but at least it manages to be entertaining. the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history. it has plenty of shocks and suspense, seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen, had me on the edge of my seat. the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension. we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen. we know something terrible is always awaiting her, and that made things all the more tense. this movie is often neglected among horror fans, but i personally think it's one of the better one's out there, and it certainly has enough for all horror fans, to be satisfied.performances. cristina raines has her wooden moments, but came though in a big way for the most part. she's beautiful to look at, and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural. chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend, michael. he had an instant screen presence, and i couldn't help but love him. martin balsam,josé ferrer,john carradine,ava gardner,arthur kennedy,sylvia miles,deborah raffin,jerry orbach,richard dreyfuss,jeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles, or small cameos. burgess meredith is terrific as chazen. he looks like a normal old man, but what we find out, is absolutely terrifying. eli wallach&christopher wlaken do well, as the bumbling detectives. beverly d'angelo has one chilling scene, that i won't spoil.bottom line. the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans, sadly tend to neglect. it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied. well worth the look.7/10

time has not been kind to this movie. once controversial adaptation of jeffrey konvitz' best-seller, now this film looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical spookfest. gruesome touches aside (particularly that crazy, over the top finale), this is essentially a glossy horror movie for those people that do not care much for the genre. it has an extraordinary cast in small roles (jose ferrer, ava gardner, eli wallach, burgess meredith, christopher walken, and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast in order to convince the audience that this is not your average lowbrow movie (producers of '70s disaster movies had a similar idea). i kind liked to see the familiar faces, but the story is very silly, and no matter how high class the film pretends to be, it operates at the level of your average '70s exploitation movie (not an entirely bad thing, though). still, it is an enjoyable movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing. as usual, albert whitlock's matte work is outstanding. overall, pretty entertaining.

i'm not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity, as despite some rather silly goings on; the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money. michael winner has admitted many times that he's not the best director of all time, and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film; but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it's uninspired direction, and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it. the plot is rich with mystery, and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat. she finds that she can't afford most properties she looks at, but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price. her problems start soon after moving in, as she doesn't like her neighbours very much...and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour; an elderly blind priest on the top floor...the cast list is truly superb, with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast. chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines, but small parts for the likes of john carradine, eli wallach, ava gardner, jeff goldblum and christopher walken, to name but a handful more than make up for sarandon's lifeless portrayal. michael winner does a good job with his central location, as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story. the film is a little slow to start, but it's never boring; and michael winner's screenplay provides a surprise that's almost impossible to guess from the offset, which certainly deserves some praise. like many similar slow-burning horrors, this one doesn't go for the money shot early on - but unlike many, the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer, and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true; i've got to say that he does a very good job at it! overall, while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it; the sentinel is one of the better films of its type, and it's definitely a major highlight for its director.

this horror movie, based on the novel of the same name, suffers from flawed production and choppy, amateurish direction, but it's nonetheless strangely compelling. unlike shocker horror flicks such as the exorcist, this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil. it drifts into horror, which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl who's been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel. her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world. this falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life.the story is true to the book, which was riveting, but the way it's edited can lose the viewer. there are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily, which hurts this film. that's a pity. the sentinel is not an edge-of-your-seat kind of flick; it's more a watch-and-squirm uncomfortably. like a bad car wreck, there's a compulsion to look even when it becomes unbearable. this movie isn't all bad, and still has a capacity to shock.the cast was competent. christina raines was captivating as alison, the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides, a pawn in the never-ending battle between good and evil. chris sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately self-centered boyfriend. eli wallach and a very young christopher walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle they've been handed. ava gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property. the gaunt elderly john carradine, with his arthritis-twisted hands, is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced. the devil is played to charming perfection by burgess meredith; he's so sweet and yet so evil. there are future stars hidden in this film: beverly d'angelo and jeff goldblum as friends of the poor girl, and jerry orbach playing successfully against type as a jerky television director. the damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks. whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius.the horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly, such as when alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores. she relives her first suicide attempt, faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians, and sees a cat cut up as a cake. time and again, she's yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy, through dreams and waking nightmares, all the while lacking the means to cope. in truth, the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel. will he succeed...? in summary, slow-moving yet indescribably creepy, well-acted but poorly directed, and a very typical 70's horror film before the real shockers cut loose. (no pun intended) this movie may not work for those with a short attention span, but it can still send chills up the spine, and still can provide some low-key shock value. it remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil.

boasting an all-star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the "mad mad mad mad world" of horror pictures, "the sentinel" (1977) is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress cristina raines. in this one, she plays a fashion model, alison parker, who moves into a brooklyn heights brownstone that is (and i don't think i'm giving away too much at this late date) very close to the gateway of hell. and as a tenant in this building, she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug, to put it mildly! indeed, the scene in which alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying, and should certainly send the ice water coursing down the spines of most viewers. despite many critics' complaints regarding raines' acting ability, i thought she was just fine, more than ably holding her own in scenes with ava gardner, burgess meredith, arthur kennedy, chris sarandon and eli wallach. the picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion, and although some plot points go unexplained, i was left feeling more than satisfied. as the book "dvd delirium" puts it, "any movie with beverly d'angelo and sylvia miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can't be all bad"! on a side note, yesterday i walked over to 10 montague terrace in brooklyn heights to take a look at the sentinel house. yes, it's still there, and although shorn of its heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priest/nun at the top-floor window, looks much the same as it did in this picture. if this house really does sit atop the entrance to hell, i take it that hell is...the brooklyn queens expressway. but we new yorkers have known that for some time!

this happens to be one of my favorite horror films. it's a rich, classy production boasting an excellent cast of ensemble actors, beautiful on-location cinematography, a haunting musical score, an intelligent and novel plot theme, and an atmosphere of dread and menace. it's reminiscent of such classic films as rosemary's baby and the shining, wherein young, vulnerable women find themselves victimized by supernatural forces in old, creepy buildings with a macabre past. here, cristina raines plays a top new york city fashion model named alison parker. her happy, outgoing exterior masks a deeply conflicted and troubled soul. this is evidenced by the revelation that in her past, she attempted suicide twice- once as a teenage girl after walking in on her degenerate father cavorting in bed with two women and having him rip a silver crucifix from her neck and toss it on the floor, and the second time, after her married lawyer-boyfriend's wife supposedly committed suicide over learning of their affair. telling her beau(played by a suitably slimy chris sarandon) that she needs to live on her own for a year or so, she answers a newspaper ad for a fully-furnished, spacious one-bedroom apartment in an old brooklyn heights brownstone. this building actually exists and is located at 10 montague terrace right by the brooklyn heights promenade off remsen street. the producers actually filmed inside the building and its apartments, paying the residents for their inconvenience, of course. the real estate agent, a miss logan(ava gardner), seems to be very interested in having alison take the apartment- an interest that cannot be solely explained by the 6% commission she would earn. especially when she quickly drops the rental price from $500.00 a month to $400.00. alison agrees and upon leaving the building with miss logan, notices an elderly man sitting and apparently staring at her from the top-floor window. miss logan identifies the man to her as father halliran and tells alison that he's blind. alison's response is very logical- "blind? then what does he look at?" after moving in, alison meets some of the other residents in the building, including a lesbian couple played by sylvia miles and beverly d'angelo, who provide alison with an uncomfortable welcome to the building. alison's mental health and physical well-being soon start to deteriorate and she is plagued by splitting headaches and fainting spells. when she relays her concerns to miss logan about her sleep being disturbed on a nightly basis by clanging metal and loud footsteps coming from the apartment directly over her, she is dumbstruck to learn that apart from the blind priest and now herself, no one has lived in that building for the last three years. summoning the courage one night to confront her nocturnal tormentor, she arms herself with a butcher knife and a flashlight and enters the apartment upstairs. she is confronted by the cancer-riddled specter of her dead father and uses the knife on him in self-defense when he comes after her. the police investigate and find no sign of violence in that apartment- no corpse, no blood, nothing. yet alison fled the building and collapsed in the street, covered in blood- her own, as it turns out. but there's nary a mark on her. what alison doesn't realize until the film's denouement is that her being in that brownstone has a purpose. she was put there for a reason- a reason whose origin dates back to the biblical story of the garden of eden and of the angel uriel who was posted at its entrance to guard it from the devil. she is being unknowingly primed and prepped by the catholic church to assume a most important role- one that will guarantee that her soul, which is damned for her two suicide attempts, can be saved. at the same time, the "invisible" neighbors, who turn out to be more than just quirky oddballs, have a different agenda in mind for her. this is a competent and intelligently done film and one that surprisingly portrays the church and its representatives in a mostly sympathetic light.

in the hands of a more skilled director, this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece. despite michael "death wish" winner's merely passable direction, the movie is interesting, original and more than a little scary.the script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back (several it can't shake) including chris sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down. burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor. eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly d'angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover. john carradine does a heck-of-a job sitting in a chair. and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown-at-the-time chris walken! this movie is creepy and creative. the plot twists are lovely, if a tad predictable. the climax, of which i will give no detail, is disturbing and quite impressive. again a better director could have done more with it, nonetheless it is quite satisfying - at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror.if you like modern overproduced body-counting torture-fantasy, you won't like this. there is almost no gore. the direction is quite spartan. the effects are few, although there's some delightful makeup near the end - most of which actually isn't makeup...but perhaps i've said too much already.i've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify, but i enjoyed it as much as any "8" film that i've seen.

i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california when this movie came out. as good as it is on dvd, it's even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen. although it has been about 9 years since i have seen it, it is still one of my all-time favorites. at the risk of sounding trite, "they just don't make 'em like this anymore!" if sixth sense freaked you out at all, this movie is definitely for you! great storyline, incredible cast of characters, ominous setting; even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it. i highly recommend you not watch it alone. what a brownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone, will have you gasping (it would be at least 10-times that price today).

nyc model alison parker (cristina raines) rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations. as lawyer boyfriend michael lerman (chris sarandon) goes about making inquiries on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her sanity (not to mention her will to live) as her experiences take a toll on her physical, mental, and emotional health.i don't want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it. the story is interesting and entertaining, but the film doesn't really offer much in terms of real scares. or, for that matter, any atmosphere. it is sort of quietly sinister, but it's not like the traditional horror film. it's more of a story about a troubled woman's attempts to deal with the increasing unreality in her life. on that level, it works, but it's not quite powerful enough.what "the sentinel" *does* offer are some eye-catching set pieces (in particular, the fascinating, fabulously creepy climax, and there's a scene with beverly d'angelo that must be seen to be believed). there's also some gore to be seen, but not very much. an ominous music score by gil melle adds to the menace.no review of this film would be complete without an appraisal for the film-makers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast. some of them don't get to do too much, but to see all of them together is impressive. eli wallach and burgess meredith make the biggest impressions as, respectively, a hard-nosed detective and a solicitous neighbor. other legendary names include jose ferrer, arthur kennedy, and ava gardner. future stars like d'angelo, christopher walken, tom berenger, jeff goldblum make brief appearances, and other familiar faces include jerry orbach, sylvia miles, william hickey, and martin balsam. whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize.written for the screen by director michael winner, probably best known for the "death wish" series that he did with charles bronson, from the novel by jeffrey konvitz.i wouldn't consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining.7/10

a young woman who is a successful model, and is also engaged to be married, and who has twice attempted suicide in the past, is chosen by a secretive and distant association of catholic priests to be the next "sentinel" to the gateway to hell, which apparently goes through a creepy old, but well maintained brooklyn apartment building. its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves, but apparently can't escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way. the previous one(john carradine) is about dead, so she, by fate or whatever, becomes the next one, and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free. lots of interesting details lie under the surface, her relationship with her father, the stories of the doomed, her fiancé, so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror, but given the sets, the great cast, and overall level of bizarreness, this is definitely worth seeing.

here's a decent mid-70's horror flick about a gate of hell in nyc that just happens to be an old brownstone. seems like there's lots of gates of hell around, but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend/fiancée and so she just happens to pick one, which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment. she meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat. upon meeting with the realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs, she finds out that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants. whoa! then who are all these weirdos? her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by chris sarandon) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot. this has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her "sometimes" neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing. a bit of decent gore and even a parade of less-than-normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch, and while i've seen this many times on tv the uncut dvd version is much better, of course. not a bad little horror flick, maybe a good companion piece to "burnt offerings". 8 out of 10.

christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film's end. this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs. the devil, to the gateway to hell, to bizarre rituals, to a growing conspiracy, and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film. we get ava gardner, burgess meredith, chris sarandon, jerry orbach, deborah raffin, arthur kennedy, jose ferrer, slyvia miles, beverly deangelo, eli wallach, martin balsam, christopher walkin, william hickey, tom berenger, jeff goldblum, and who can forget john carradine as the old priest. many of these actors ham it up - particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comic/demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat. meredith is memorable as is balsam and chris sarandon. some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo. the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes. the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling. i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film, particularly that whole scene with deangelo and miles. was that really necessary? i think not. also, the father/daughter stuff was a bit much as well, but overall the film works and has a winning pace. director michael winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments. the scenes with carradine are particularly effective.

sigh i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner? surely he isn't the avatar of subtlety, as his films are practically always hard-handed and confronting, but so what? they're awesomely entertaining. his most famous action movies, like the first three entries in the "death wish"-series for example, are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns, but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres  like the religious horrors of "the sentinel" for example  he doesn't stand a chance with any of the critics. "the sentinel" generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release, when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth. pretty much the exact same controversy caused todd's browning's masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema "freaks" to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years! and why? just because certain prudish and easily offended people, who shouldn't watch the movie in the first place, claim it's an unethical thing to do? i don't suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films, so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place? another major reason why critics didn't warmly welcome "the sentinel" is because jeffrey konvitz' novel  and thus michael winner's screenplay  is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus, according to the merciless pens of horror critics, little more than pure plagiarism. admittedly "the sentinel" borrows multiple substantial elements from "rosemary's baby", "the omen" and "the exorcist", but let's face it, 70's cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories. if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and, in all fairness, a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots, "the sentinel" honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying 70's horror-highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you're not likely to forget easy.alison parker, a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas, moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn, deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to wed her several times already. alison's physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after, and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery. she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats, even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants. she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide. it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building, but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this. it's truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alison's brownstone apartment is the earth's gateway to hell itself and she's the chosen one to guard it, because the film's script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation. for nearly 75 minutes (and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences) michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alison's own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fiancée's odd behavior are strictly red herrings. multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius, like alison's flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs. the whole climax, with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above, is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail-biting denouements i ever witnessed.the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive, especially considering "the sentinel" still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isn't the most popular among prominent actors, but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective. with such an extended cast, obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos. martin balsam and john carradine, for example, only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together. several others (like christopher walken, jeff goldblum, beverly d'angelo and tom berenger) perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays, but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers. my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector. the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up, even though he sports a ridiculous mustache. in my humble opinion "the sentinel" is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie, and most definitely a must-see for true genre fanatics.

man, i really love the new dvd that universal put out. i've never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy, grainy vhs tapes for years. unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear. and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs. it sucks.anyway, troubled fashion model alison parker (cristina raines) moves into haunted nyc brownstone, only it's more than just haunted. it's also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest (john carradine) to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch-angels don't escape. this has an all star cast full of old-timey actors like ava gardner, arthur kennedy, jose ferrer etc... as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including christopher walken, jeff goldblum (who's voice was mysteriously overdubbed) and tom berenger. and you won't even recognize jerry orbach from law & order. i had to do a double-take when i didn't quite place where i'd seen him before.nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father's rotting corpse that's been possessed by the devil. and there's a neat ending where disfigured, deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she won't be the next one to guard the portal. it seems alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinel.an excellent, creepy 70s classic from director michael winner that shouldn't be missed. i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy.7 out of 10-

''the sentinel'' is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie's industry! i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are. alison parker is a model with some fame. she dates a lawyer called michael lerman, and has as a best friend, another model called jennifer. everything was great in her life, until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartment.the problem are her neighbors, who are very, very strange. suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency; she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions. but everything has a reason, and it has to do with the new house she is living...i personally find ''the sentinel'' a very creepy movie, and along with ''the exorcist'' they are two of the scariest movies i already watched. when we discover that alison's house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze! it's also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world.

of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel. i mean, yes, there were movies like the exorcist, and other ones; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. if you have time, check this one out. you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth getting into.then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. my absolute favorites were eli wallach, sylvia miles, and burgess meredith. then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too. pay close attention. i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. plus, the books are really good as well. i'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film. it's so scary that it would outdo this movie.

i have read the book and i must say that this movie stays true to form. i think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of psycho. cristina raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and burgess meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next-door neighbor. i have seen this movie at least twice and i think that i am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection. the suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end, the twist you will never see coming. if you like movies like signs and the village, the sentinel will be a classic prelude. also, what is interesting is the actors in the movie-you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits. the late jerry orbach is great as the commercial director and jeff goldblum is excellent as the photographer. also there is beverly d'angelo, who is underrated but great.

bored with the normal, run-of-the-mill staple films to watch this halloween that i've seen over and over again, i took a chance on "the sentinel", hoping it could get my horror juices flowing again. mind you, i had just come back from seeing the dark castle remake of "the house on haunted hill" - complete and utter crap. thankfully, "the sentinel" blew me away! in a riviting story about a model who moves into a creepy building in brooklyn hights, the film offered everything that i hope to find in a good movie - (1) campy and fantasically juicy characters, exchanges and dialogue, including hilaraious turns by christopher walken, jeff goldblum and especially, martin balsam, as an absent minded professor - (2) horrifying terror! not to give a frame away, but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas - (3) fantastic gore, terrific make-up and wacky (if very uneven) direction from michael winner, which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat. if you loved "evil dead 2", "dead alive" and "deep rising" - this will be your queen of favourites. just to emphasize my love for this film - after i watched it for the first time, jaw-dropped, i rewound it and watched it again. it is now one of favourites of all time. do yourself a favour and check it out!

bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by cristina raines (later of tv's "flamingo road") as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the gateway to hell! the scenes with raines modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, deborah raffin is charming as cristina's pal, but when raines moves into a creepy brooklyn heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really start cooking. the neighbors, including a fantastically wicked burgess meredith and kinky couple sylvia miles & beverly d'angelo, are a diabolical lot, and eli wallach is great fun as a wily police detective. the movie is nearly a cross-pollination of "rosemary's baby" and "the exorcist"--but what a combination! based on the best-seller by jeffrey konvitz, "the sentinel" is entertainingly spooky, full of shocks brought off well by director michael winner, who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill. ***1/2 from ****

minor spoilersalison parker (cristina raines) is a successful top model, living with the lawyer michael lerman (chris sarandon) in his apartment. she tried to commit suicide twice in the past: the first time, when she was a teenager and saw her father cheating her mother with two women in her home, and then when michael's wife died. since then, she left christ and the catholic church behind. alison wants to live alone in her own apartment and with the help of the real state agent miss logan (ava gardner), she finds a wonderful furnished old apartment in brooklyn heights for a reasonable rental. she sees a weird man in the window in the last floor of the building, and miss logan informs that he is father francis matthew halloran (john carradine), a blinded priest who lives alone supported by the catholic church. alison moves to her new place, and once there, she receives a visitor: her neighbor charles chazen (burgess meredith) welcomes her and introduces the new neighbors to her. then, he invites alison to his cat jezebel's birthday party in the night. on the next day, weird things happen with alison in her apartment and with her health. alison looks for miss logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. a further investigation shows that all the persons she knew in the party were dead criminals. frightened with the situation, alison embraces christ again, while michael investigates the creepy events. alison realizes that she is living in the gateway to hell. although underrated in imdb user rating, 'the sentinel' is one of the best horror movies ever. i have seen this film at least six times, being the first time in the 70's, in the movie theater. in 07 september 2002, i bought the imported dvd and saw it again. yesterday i saw this movie once more. even after so many years, this film is still terrific. the creepy and lurid story frightens even in the present days. the cast is a constellation of stars and starlets. you can see many actors and actresses, who became famous, in the beginning of career. fans of horror movie certainly worships 'the sentinel', and i am one of them. my vote is nine.title (brazil): 'a sentinela dos malditos' ('the sentinel of the damned')obs.: on 02 september 2007, i saw this movie again.

you'd be forgiven to think a finnish director from helsinki would be no good at directing an american horror movie (especially one entirely located inside a us prison) - see this to prove yourself wrong! it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern diy company tv advert (something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to $100m+ budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind!) being mr harlin's first major production and the - at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar - cast. i still think most of the nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with stellan stargaard's screen appearances (not mentioning the well overrated mr(s) bergman directorial efforts) - at least for all female viewers - but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense. do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff, imo it's definitely worth it!

i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it. both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects. it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings, from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor. also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors, from viggo to tiny. also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called "disney gate" by locals. if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins, most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour. it was a lot of fun working for and with r. harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again.

caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for. many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see. the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre.it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself. an absolute diamond, a film i still have on video to this day. check it out.

a long-defunct prison, shut down for over 20 years, is re-opened and ethan sharpe (the late, great character actor lane smith), once a guard there, is put in place as warden. as the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up, they're instructed to break into the old execution room. this unleashes a fierce spirit that wreaks merciless havoc upon both guards and prisoners; cool-as-can-be low-key prisoner burke (viggo mortensen, showing real poise in an early role) is thrust into the role of hero.i know it's a no-brainer to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was shot in an actual abandoned penitentiary near rawlins, wyoming), but it elevates this horror film to a higher level. it's got a great sense of foreboding, established right at the outset. director renny harlin made his fourth directorial effort here; it got him the "nightmare on elm street 4" directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in mainstream action movies, thrillers, and horror films.it may have stock characters, but it's got a capable cast bringing them to life: chelsea field as the young woman vying for prison reform, lincoln kilpatrick as weary veteran convict cresus, tom everett as restless con rabbitt, ivan kane as the outgoing lasagna, tommy "tiny" lister as soft-spoken giant tiny, and arlen dean snyder as captain horton. it's also worth noting as an early acting credit for kane hodder (as the vengeful spirit) that helped *him* land the gig of playing jason voorhees in the "friday the 13th" series.decent special effects, moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer mac ahlberg, spooky music by richard band and christopher stone, great visuals, the incredibly gloomy location, and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining. it's nasty, gruesome, and good fun for a horror fan.8/10

prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and 'happy vibes', what with stories of fights, chaos, murder and of course extreme male bonding! but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether. horror films set in cells are, as you probably know, nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape  two of the greatest themes in horror cinema. with such examples as the chair (waldermar korzeniowsky, 1988), the green mile (frank darabont, 1999), alien 3 (david fincher, 1992)and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself, another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised. or at least that's what you'd have thought. prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it's somewhat of a shame that it isn't as well known as it should be.the film, in short, centres on an old prison (well, duh!) which has been reopened. however, it's not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear, but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind; death! and boy, are we treated to some awesome death scenes! i won't spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands.besides the special effects and the murders, this film also has another thing going for it; it's cast. headlining, we have lord of the rings (peter jackson, 2001-2003) star viggo mortensen (and for all those so inclined, yes, he does get naked) whose performance is not only highly believable, but is done with such skill that his eastwood-esquire character is both bad-to-the-bone and likable (a very delicate mix). add him to a cast of 'hey-wait-a-minute-i-know-that-guy' actors and you've got yourself one great set of stars. the characters themselves however lack three-dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical. we've got a black oculist, a hard-as-nails prison warden, a human-rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters. but in all honesty, this 'fault' actually aids the film. instead of boring character development in an over-long equilibrium, we are chucked, more or less, straight into the action and once it gets going (very early on) there's not a single scene that's a filler  it's balls to the wall plot. unlike a certain shawshank redemption (frank darabont, 1994 )! sharing conventions with the slasher genre, this is somewhat of a convention itself, and, in good ol' slasher genre tradition, prison punishes those who have been bad.all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world. with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans. don't be fooled into thinking it'll be a cheesy little film either, just because it was made in usa 1980s, it's far from cheesy (although the very end does ruin this) and, simultaneously, far from gritty and realistic (whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape, these are rather subtly done).i give it 3.5 out of 5 luvs. a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed.

viggo mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden (played well by lane smith) has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence. lincoln kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life. when i think prison movies, i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as shawshank redemption or the green mile. however i didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii. prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlin's career. the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (at the time) unknowns. lane smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual cliché of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations.*** out of 4-(good)

prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there's a good reason for that because it's not one of the best...but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films. the film does have some connection to blockbusters; for a start it's an early directorial effort for renny harlin; the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2, cliffhanger and deep blue sea; and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen. the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison's governor. naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance.the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base. this is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn't really have a 'plot' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it's never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess. the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. as the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict's ghost and while it's fairly interesting, some things about it don't make sense and it drags the film down a little. still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down.

this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie. the acting is excellent considering the script & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. the gore is well done and used sparingly (look out for the excellent barbed-wire death) & the action is punchy when used. it's true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times, but compared to other movies on the same (or bigger!) budget, it's hardly noticeable at all. overall, this is recommended. trust me, it's better than it appears! 8/10

i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection - many unseen - and picked out a movie, based on the box art, i thought would be fun, and yes, bad. prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box. i sat down and watched, and lo! and behold!, found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind. fortunately, i reversed mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total. prison tells the story of an old, dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns. it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners. the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film. the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair. we see lane smith as a guard - tearing away a crucifix before sending the man to his maker. we then go to present day, first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re-opening the old prison. then we see the new warden, lane smith, haunted by a nightmare in bed - and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years. well, the rest follows suit: prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding. we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters. the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a workmanlike job. viggo mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid. tom everett, tiny lister, and ivan kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters. chelsea field is okay as the female lead. the best performance is by lincoln kilpatrick, an underrated character actor, as cresus - a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the "man" had been executed" with some kind of terrible secret. prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that, but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it. i was pleasantly surprised at the way director renny harlin created a story so visually atmospheric. the film has a tense, taut pace and harlin knows how to build his scenes. there are a few excessively shot gore scenes - the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes. but these scenes are visually creative and interesting. the acting is uniformly decent. the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these. that may in part be credited to irwin yablans who wrote the story. you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday. here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is. give prison a break(get it).

what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise, a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films. so...could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated??? "prison" is the finnish director harlin's american debut, which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like "die hard 2", "cliffhanger" and "deep blue sea". the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison, re-opened for the cause of over-population in other, more modern state penitentiaries. inside the former execution dungeons, the restless spirit of the electric chair's last victim still dwells around. the now promoted warden eaton sharpe (lane smith) was there already 40 years ago, when this innocent man was put to death, and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial. it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived. viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past."prison" contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the unbearably tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain! unlike any other horror picture from that decade, "prison" features an amazing sense of realism! by this, i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls, of course, and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed... even though these are genuinely unsettling as well. the film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror. the absolute best terror-moment (providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age) focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire. haunting!! the screenplay only suffers one flaw, but that's a common one...almost inevitable, i guess: clichés! the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding. we've got the ugly, fat pervert with his 'cute' boy-toy, the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old 'n wise black con who serves a lifetime (did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman?) don't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise, as there are so many other elements to admire. the photography is dark and moist, the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class b-actors are excellent (the fans will recognize tom everett, tom 'tiny' lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder). forget about wes craven's god-awful attempt "shocker" or the downright pathetic cheese-flick "the chair". this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down! especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays (i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves, hobbits and other fairy creatures...) this true 80's horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd-release!

story of a wrongly executed prisoner who haunts the prison he was electrocuted in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed him.viggo mortensen is great, and the acting is pretty good overall. lane smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden. also, this film has some great gore, including death by barbed-wire mummification.

renny harlin's first american film was one of the best of a slew of prison-set horror films(like "death house" or "the chair")in the late 80's.twenty years before,guard lane smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man.now,he is the warden of the newly re-opened prison,and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge.this atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence.viggo mortensen,tiny lister,tom everett and kane hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage.

ok, so i don't watch too many horror movies - and the reason is films like 'dark remains'. i caught this on (a surprisingly feature-filled) dvd and it scared me silly. in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pants.however, the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised i'd only really seen about 10% of it. the rest of the time i'd been watching the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes. the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up again.the film-making is solid and the characters' situation was really compelling. the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump-button - it's merely a woodland, a cabin and a disused jail - and a lot of darkness. most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the make-up effects really looked like it was! also, it's obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film-making. the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done. i noticed on-line that this film won the la shriekfest - a really major achievement, and i guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers' clear talent - and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed to.turn up the sound, turn off the lights, and, if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.

i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more.this is the way a proper horror movie should be.i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic. the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out.it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated.the special effects were very good.i would love to see more horror movies like this one.this is easily one of my favorite's.a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie.other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches.i will be adding it to my collection.the dvd has some interesting special features.

although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff hodges, it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me i'm not that easy. you might say that i'm biased about the film, and, ok, i am, but i didn't see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and was extremely pleased. i'm not a horror film fan as such but love the old "b" movies and black and white sci fi films. this movie will make you "think" you know when something is going to happen, then it doesn't, then it does. it will keep you completely off balance. i would suggest watching the movie first then the director's notes and special features. it is so well written, directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew. i sincerely hope to be part of brian and laurence's future projects.

this movie scared the crap out of me! i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary. i screamed out loud two or three times during the show.film-making-wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography. the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful. i read somewhere that it's some weird husband and wife team that made it. for some reason that makes this even stranger for me. if you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you! very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls!

i just watched this movie and have to say, i was very impressed. it's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat! i had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! if i had to criticise, i'd say that perhaps if anything, there were too many jump moments. it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect, because you kind of new what was coming.although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy, fear-factor. it had elements of the shining, the 6th sense and the changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling).i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!

well, this film is a difficult one really. to be straight with you, this film doesn't contain much of a riveting story, nore does it make u 'want' to know how it'll end...but i'll tell you something now...never have i been as tense and jumped up before in my life! this film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills! to be fair, i did watch it at almost midnight so i was kinda sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why i was jumpy...or maybe it's because this film does deliver in that aspect! it's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. they decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains...all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (i think it's it's the sister of the main character, and she brings along her husband)...during the night, the husband hears noises...checks it out, and thats when things start to go really really wrong...they don't stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn't right...to cut a long story short...eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of.it's not a hollywood blockbuster, nore does it have a huge budget, but please don't let that put you off. it's creepy, tense and very very jumpy! just give it a try :)

dark remains is a home run plain and simple. the film is full of creepy visuals, and scares' that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat. the staircase scene in particular, these guys are good. although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good, and the actors come through. dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some, but i guess it makes you think. cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives', however some side characters like the sheriff didn't convince me. they aren't all that important anyways. i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story/ japanese remake.

i'm not at all picky about horror movies, and i'm willing to watch pretty much any of them. that doesn't mean that i'm willing to re-watch many of them, or that i won't have criticism for them. this movie is creepy, and is very well done. in fact, i think this movie would make an excellent double-bill with session 9.i should specify, before i get to my comments, that i watched this alone. i started watching it before going to bed, and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective, so i saved the rest of it for the morning. even while watching it in broad daylight, it was still creepy. however, i can't vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group.after the death of their daughter, a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death. let me make note of this death - this is one of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child. this is much more important, as it both sets the tone, as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie.the couple is not doing well. the wife has distanced herself from the relationship, and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back. while some of the comments have complained about their acting - one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife, and that's legitimate. he's trying to give her more direction. it's a role that men sometimes take on.there are a variety of scares in the film, and most are fairly non-violent, though grotesque in some ways. the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film, and takes an odd turn near the end. while the turn is not absurd, it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing.moody, atmospheric, and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video.

first, nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly. not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard-boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides (ghost trains) as a child. second, the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future. third, this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes, eva mendezes, and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb-lights are. mrs. christian is not a light, but a sun.however, "dark remains" is also of considerable metaphysical importance. they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and "imagination" that are not visible with one' own eyes is not new. but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times. this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality (by which reality turns into a sign), but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the "real" reality can. being a sign, the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects, i.e. the sign behaves like an object. now, in our usual world of perception, it is common that objects change signs. f.ex., if someone grows a bird, his photograph will show him with beard, not without, as it did before. but the opposite, the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man. this is, very simply expressed, the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison, in this movie. this is new, and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well-known, mostly since the silent time.

allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night. no one knows who killed the little girl but it's why they moved to the mountains. so the couple moves into this cabin and it's haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it.this movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump. some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didn't expect. it was a pretty good movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good.i also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends. it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie.

this movie was very good. if you are one who likes to watch horror movies, i recommend it. the acting was very good although i thought that the actress playing julie could have had more emotion behind her lines. allan was very good and i thought the cinematography was amazing. i was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming. it was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen. i give it two thumbs up! i definitely would say that if you haven't already seen it then go rent it. if you have seen it and didn't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal. i also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my school's campus.

following their daughter's brutal murder,julie and allen escape the city to find solace and grieve in a solitary cabin on a remote mountain.allen's intentions are good,he wants his wife to get out of her depression by resuming her photography.julie stumbles across an ancient prison and sees the perfect creepy,decaying setting for her photography.but when the photos are developed they are full of dead people-and allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide in their new mountain."dark remains" is a pretty decent indie horror flick.it offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension.the acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great.7 out of 10.

after all the crap that hollywood (and the indies) have churned out, we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments. there are some clichéd moments, but i'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie. there's not much new here...it's just done well.make sure and pay attention, as the "subtle" scares come quickly and often. this is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza.there's one very well-written red herring in this movie and, unfortunately, one very poorly-cast role. cheri christian just doesn't make an effective julie (the wife/mother). for one thing, she's totally unsympathetic. i know, i know...she's just gone through a traumatic experience. but the viewer never gets to know her as she "normally" is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting (in an unintentional way). i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her, but i never did.finally, a thumbs-up for the ending, which is both disturbing and satisfying. it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits, but the director wisely resisted.this is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is a good, old-fashioned scary movie...something that's rather rare nowadays.

finally, an indie film that actually delivers some great scares! i see most horror films that come out... theatrical, straight-to-dvd, cable, etc... and most of them suck... a few are watchable... even fewer are actually good... dark remains is one of the good ones. i caught a screening of this film at the south padre island film festival... the audience loved it... and my wife and i loved it! having no name actors, i assume the budget on this film was pretty low, but you wouldn't know it... the film looks fantastic... the acting totally works for the film... the story is good... and the scares are great! while most filmmakers focus solely on the scares, they often forget about story and character development, two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently. brian avenet-bradley must know that character and story are important. he develops both to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and are therefore more scared when they are in danger.watching horror films that cost anywhere from $80 million to $5000 to make, i find "dark remains" to be one of the gems out there. check this film out!

what's good about it: some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan. doesn't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its "gotcha" moments. even if you've seen everything, there's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop.what could have been better about it: the acting was, at times, flat and unconvincing. it had a "shot-on-video" quality in some places (though,it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for), and the camera work is full of needless close-ups of meaningless actions. though the effects are genuinely creepy, i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them. the ending seemed rushed, and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments. the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves, not as a challenge by the filmmakers, but because they just missed it.still, a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average. well worth the rental.

for years we've been watching every horror film that comes out, from the dull hollywood retreads like saw 2, to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable... we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like "dark remains".we managed to catch a screening of this film at shriekfest 2005. the audience loved it and i believe it ended up winning the award for the best film.while it may not have the budget or star power of studio films, it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category. the acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view. the story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares.the editing and visual fx are also top notch. and while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit, the score for "dark remains" only adds to it's creepiness.i know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals, but none have been near me, so i can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on dvd. trust me, even if you're sick of the current state of horror films, give this one a try... you won't regret it!

it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series, from one to seven. and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain. plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn't see and i what to see it so badly like part two. it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans, which is cool, and showed the return of the puppet master from part one. it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool, it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did.so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit.

this movie is a great way for the series to finally end. peter (the boy from puppet master iii) is all grown up and is now the puppet master. well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets. most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii, puppet master iii, puppet master 4, puppet master 5, curse of the puppet master, and retro puppet master (sorry... but i guess paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1). personally i wish puppet master vs. demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say "this is the final movie in the series..."

"the day time ended" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it's better than "close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story doesn't make sense. but that only makes it all the more intriguing. like many of the best works of art, "the day time ended" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the "existential" european films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)

the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. director john "bud" cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger, crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds. moreover, cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder. the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus: jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams, dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana, christopher mitchum as the concerned richard, marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth, natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny, and scott c. kolden as the gutsy steve. the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures, neat stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and nifty matte paintings. richard band's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot. john arthur morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick. a fun flick.

if you love cult 70's sci-fi the way i do, or if you like movies such as "repo man" or "buckaroo bonzai" than you're going to love this one. it's a stream of consciousness 70's sci-fi spectacular, including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now. this movie is pure 70's. put on steve miller's "fly like an eagle" or pink floyd's "dark side of the moon" and you're ready to go!

considering it was made on a low budget, the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work.the story involves a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they think. but their youngest daughter (natasha ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. and only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. thus the family, led by jim davis and dorothy malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.mixing in elements of 2001: a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind, the day time ended, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen. the desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters; and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubrick's or spielberg's films, the day time ended is much better than many other 2001/close encounters knock-offs. i give credit to director john 'bud' cardos, whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia, for at least trying--and on that basis, i give the day time ended a 7 out of 10.

bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the williams family, living in the california desert. they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other, a friendly and tiny little e.t. who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. this picture does show off a little imagination, if nothing else.very nice music by richard band, engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen, randall william cook, and peter kuran, and, importantly, a likable family are key assets. it generates a sense of child-like amazement; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.i found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion, and a decent credit for director john "bud" cardos (of "kingdom of the spiders" fame) and executive producer charles band.7/10

okay, we've got extreme verhoeven violence (although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks), we've got plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missing...oh, yes, it's missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci-fi movies. i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most verhoeven films, the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre. the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible. the crew has truly made an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects done on set). the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible, they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible.the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive. here, it takes place at a lab for the most part. i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or let's say steal something from people's purses, or something like that. but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie. grade: b

contains spoilers"hollow man" is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven, director of great movies like "total recall", "starship troopers" and "robocop" has ever made. that's probably not his fault. for some reason, verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script, and he made the best of it. the first part of this movie is rather good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even skunk anansie on the soundtrack. unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad "alien" clone. the ending is especially ridiculous <spoiler>, as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. </spoiler>. and the entire thing is quite shallow, indeed: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated.but all in all, verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie. **1/2 out of **** stars

paul verhoeven (genius and master film maker) strikes back with the less than perfect, yet still fun in a "dirty old man type of way," hollow man. the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints. yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it's mind blowing special effects (perhaps the best so far around) and two dandy performances by the leads. verhoeven's moral questions are of course thought provoking, and although the film turned off many, this movie is pretty soft-core for old verhoeven.two major flaws: josh brolin (aka walking ape-man) and the whole deal with the elevator. if there was an access ladder, why were they trapped down in the lab? a fun horror film for a saturday night.

hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade. the sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film. kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way.claude rains shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933, well now, kevin bacon has shocked *us* with hollow man. one of the most thrilling horror films ever. the action is intense and the chills are true. you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night. the supporting cast includes elizabeth shue, josh brolin, kim dickens, joey slotnick, greg grunberg, and mary randle. all of whom do an exceptional job. ---spoilers---dr. sebastian caine (kevin bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. after animal testings, they move on to human testing. but someone has to be the subject. volenteering, caine is turned invisible. but when his team is unable to bring back into visibility, caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge...*end spoilers*the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century. becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie 2, this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go. the first 45 minutes or so are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. think of deep blue sea. then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man. and then change the water into fire and explosions. a rehashing of a killer shark movie. interesting... hollow man gets 5/5.

this movie scared me so bad, i am easily scared though so its no big thing but this movie was scary and whoever wasnt scared by this movie, im surprised because everyone i know said it was scary, i hope everyone sees it, but dont see it with the lights off like i did....

remember h.g. wells' "the invisible man"? well here's another movie like it, only more extreme. "hollow man" is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. kevin bacon plays sebastian caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes. at first making the serum was the easy part, making the person come back was not. most of the first tries ended up unstable. until one night, when he perfected the formula. and who else, but caine would be the lab rat. the gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came to, it was a close one. so when the did caine, he decided to use it for fun. then when he got tired of being not seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh. however, the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should, and caine would delve into madness. so he ends up being one mad invisible killer. it would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you. i would care less about the ones who did you wrong. great movie, plenty of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!

hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr. sebastian caine (kevin bacon) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum. they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly, caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human. he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. but then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants...directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man. you know it's just after christmas, i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief. the script by andrew w. marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man (1933) film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit. it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. i thought the character's were ok, i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself. then of course there's the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.director verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that. there's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla. there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.with a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 hollow man is technically faultless, i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they? the acting was ok, bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well i know i do. good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.

a pentagon science team seem to have perfected a serum which causes invisibility but when the lead boffin tries it out on himself he can't reverse the process. frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychotic in the classic h.g. wells tradition.this is a gleefully horrible invisible man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful verhoeven and bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac. as with much of verhoeven's work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of boy's-own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals (women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels). whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea, the cg special effects by scott e. anderson are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere. in particular, a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where bacon drowns devane in a swimming pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects. the film also has a great soundtrack by jerry goldsmith and classic horror-movie photography by jost vacano. the young cast are pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree, but both shue and dickens are impressively out of their depth. this is a great fun nasty movie.

it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased, in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version. true, "hollow man" is a remake of sorts of "the invisible man", but that's where the similarities end. "hollow man" is an entertaining movie,period. if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible, then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place. true, some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable, but "hollow man" manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends. kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible. now his mission is to make them visible again. when this team of young scientists (working, as you might guess, for the pentagon)think they have the formula for making animals visible again, kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug. after that, of course, things go wrong, as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask, so his collaborators know where he is. feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin's character, and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator (elisabeth shue) is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team, he finally snaps. the movie then turns into a hybrid of "alien" and a slasher flick, but that's not saying it's a bad turn. there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace. the special effects are top notch (a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven's films)as we get to see some "body reconstitution" sequences never seen on a movie before. if there's anything to complain about, perhaps, is the predictability of the situations herein; by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end. and the ending is a bit abrupt, but despite this, hollow man is still worth watching. if you want to know what a truly bad movie is, then waste your money on "fear dot com" (with stephen dorf) or the even worse the untold (or "sasquatsh", with land henriksen). now that is "hollow"! 8* out of 10*!

the stories in this video are very entertaining, and it definately is worth a look! the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks, with a great, but unexplained twist at the end.the seond is the best of the lot, and it alone, makes this worth watching - a man is attacked by a dog, which he fears to be rabid - he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital, but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be...... great twist at the end, and this episode alone scores 10/10! if the others were up to par with this one, this would get 10/10!the third is the weakest of the bunch - a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! there appears to be no point to the story until the end, with a good little twist, but it is spoiled by the awful first part!never the less, this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all! well worth a rental!

a classy offering from amicus, producer milton subotsky and director peter duffell ('the far pavillions' etc) turn in a classy, intelligent 'four-hander' with a strong cast (peter cushing, christopher lee, jon pertwee, ingrid pitt etc) all giving stylish performances, despite a low budget which results in a few 'un-special effects'. the most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old chloe franks who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold. only spoilt by the lurid title wished on the film by its distributors, this underrated release, a cut above the run-of-the-mill 'blood 'n' guts' shocker movie, is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror.

this is an awesome amicus horror anthology, with 3 great stories, and fantastic performances!, only the last story disappoints. all the characters are awesome, and the film is quite chilling and suspenseful, plus peter cushing and christopher lee are simply amazing in this!. it's very underrated and my favorite story has to be the 3rd one "sweets to the sweet", plus all the characters are very likable. some of it's predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather bland!, however the ending was really cool!. this is an awesome amicus horror anthology, with 3 great stories, and fantastic performances, only the last story disappoints!, i say it's must see!.1st story ("method for murder"). this is an awesome story, with plenty of suspense, and the killer dominic is really creepy, and it's very well acted as well!. this was the perfect way to start off with a story, and for the most part it's unpredictable, plus the double twist ending is shocking, and quite creepy!. grade a2nd story.

enjoyed catching this film on very late late late tv and it kept my interest through out the entire picture. this wonderful creepy, yet mysterious looking english home, with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it. there are four(4)tales concerning this house, and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems. you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds, but don't let that fool you, there is horror all over the place. peter cushing,"black jack",'80 gives a great performance as one of the person's living in the home and even christopher lee,"curse of the crimson altar",68 and his little daughter, chloe franks,(jane reid) make a wonderful exciting story together, his daughter for some reason loves to read witchcraft books! if you love creepy, horrible and mysterious films, with lots of surprises, this is the film for you!!!!

this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film (along the lines of tales from the crypt) written by robert bloch (author of psycho). it's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee (the third doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!

this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology, that if a bit short in the screenwriting department, more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting, location work and overall exuberance. the best episodes of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works ( a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian); the third, with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project. the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired, both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up! cushing is typically good in the weakest segment, which certainly isn't helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with down at the local wax museum, is anything but "beautiful" as we are told to believe she is! someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we're given a woman with a jaw of a turtle. minor quibbles aside this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can.

for fans of 1970s hammer type horror films, this movie should be a treat. the only thing i didn't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode. in general, however, this is a solid, spooky little movie. if this is not amicus' best film, it's certainly one of them. the best episode, rightfully saved for last, is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor--it is really excellent. as good as pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies. all in all, this is an entertaining movie, which scared the heck out of me as a child, and which still gives me the creeps to this day.

now days, most people don't watch classic movies, such as this. most of friends only watch movies from the '90s to present. thats kinda stingy. most old movies like this are masterpieces, unique in their own way. only because, back when these movies were being thought of and made, thats when ideas were fresh. now people strain just to think of new ideas. anyway, to the movie. for true fans of classic horror. this is for you. the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor, and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house. i won't say anymore, for i will ruin the movie more than i already have. but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is. and would never mind watching it again!

an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything. it's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates, all tied together by a wrap-around story about a scotland yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star. it starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum, then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but, and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film starand what he does to the inspector. it's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget. add to that the acting talents of peter cushing, christopher lee, denholm elliott, joss ackland, ingrid pitt and jon pertwee and you've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. just don't answer the phone if anyone from stoker real estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the english countryside

the late, great robert bloch (author of psycho, for those of you who weren't paying attention) scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid. (i had to walk miles just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater; seeing a horror movie was always unnerving, but particularly so when it was as well-executed as this one.) when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape (which should always be a last resort), i was surprised at how well it held up. take the terror test: watch it at night, alone, and then tell me it's not scary...

(spoilers included) this film surely is the best amicus production i've seen so far (even though i still have quite a few to check out). the house that dripped blood is a horror-omnibusan anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious, hellish house in the british countryside. a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate talespeter duffel's film wisely doesn't pay too much attention to that. it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that, he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before. all four stories in this film are of high quality-level and together, they make a perfect wholesome. high expectations are allowed for this film, since it was entirely written by robert bloch! yes, the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone `psycho' we're also marking peter duffel's solid and very professional debut as a director. the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics, but they're (almost) equally chilling and eerie. number one handles about a horror-author who comes to the house, along with his wife, in order to find inspiration for his new book. this starts out real well, but after a short while, his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination. the idea in this tale isn't exactly originalbut it's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising. the second story stars (hammer) horror-legend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker. still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long-lost love, he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her. cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax museums isn't new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating. this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock-moments and there's a constant tense atmosphere. it's a terrific warm-up for what is arguably the best story: number 3. another legendary actor in this one, as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father. he's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world. not without reason, since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo. besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid, this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere! the devilish undertones in this story, along with the creepy sound effects of thunder, make this story a must for fans of authentic horror. the fourth and final story, in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire-cloak he wears, is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility, but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that. there's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co-star christopher lee in the dracula series! most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt! the cult-queen from `the vampire lovers' certainly is one of the many highlights in the filmher cleavage in particular. no doubt about itthe house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans. i truly believe that, with a bit of mood-settling preparations, this could actually be one of the few movies that'll terrify you and leave a big impression. intelligent and compelling horror like it should be! highly recommended. one extra little remark, though: this film may notrepeat may not under any circumstances be confused with `the dorm that dripped blood'. this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film, except for the title it stole.

four great stories from master robert bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies, are the base of this excellent amicus' production. this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the mid-seventies and it's one of my favorite type of horror movies. this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet, where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child, heiress to her mother tradition. great fun from start to finish, and good to very good are also the other three episodes (with the last one a bit on the comic side, but with the great addition of ingrid pitt, the most famous vampress of the english cinema.

"the house that dripped blood" is one of the better anthology films of the time period.**spoilers**tracking down a missing film star, inspector holloway, (john bennett) finds that the last reported sighting was in a large mansion in the countryside. during the course of looking through the house, he is told four different stories about past residents of the house.the good story(s): method for murder-moving into the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while charles pens his latest masterwork, horror novelist charles hillyer, (denholm elliott) and his wife alice, (joanna dunham) are thrilled with the story, which centers around a serial strangler named dominic. after a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife. probably one of the better entries in the film, it's easily the creepiest. the atmosphere here is what sets it apart. the scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy, the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there's always a classic creep-out moment. the classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist's office, which is an all-time high for creepiness. the build-up to it, with the creaking sounds, quick flashes of a mysterious being, and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one's favor.sweets for the sweet-moving into a new house, widower john reid, (christopher lee) hires former school teacher ann norton, (nyree dawn porter) for his young daughter jane, (chloe franks) while he's away on business. ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from jane's past, which john vehemently denies. when she learns the true nature of what has happened, it's far more shocking that what she could've thought possible. with the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories, this is a quite pleasant entry. the mystery of the family is wonderfully played out, with small amounts of clues piled up here and there, and the final revelation is downright nerve-wracking. that part alone is the main reason why this one works, and lee doesn't harm it either.the bad story(s): waxwork-tortured by memories of his lost love, phillip grayson, (peter cushing) and his friend neville rogers, (joss ackland) both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a wax museum, as the statue takes over their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them. there's a clever premise here, and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always creepy. this is no exception, and it looks eerie, which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures. a dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense, but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace. it takes a long time for events to unfold out, and most of the time is spent on exposition. it also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away. those really lower this one a bit. had the twist been changed, it would've scored higher, the rest is acceptable.the cloak-veteran horror film actor paul henderson, (jon pertwee) upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film, goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store. the cloak soon turns him into a vampire, going crazy on the set with co-star carla, (ingrid pitt) and other vampiric acts at home. unconvinced the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination. this has a pretty decent premise, and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares, but what sinks it is several factors. first, it's just too goofy for it's own good. the plot twist at the end is a perfect example, which is so overdone that it's not really a shock at all, and just comes across as just plain silly. there's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it's just a bore to sit through. it's the weakest one in the film.the final verdict: a quite decent omnibus film, there's a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that renders this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film. highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy british horror films.today's rating-pg-13: violence

before films like 'the texas chainsaw massacre,' 'suspiria,' and 'halloween' changed the view of horror forever, there was a more gothic and far less violent era in the genre. films like the hammer horror series and 'rosemary's baby' were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s. i can't tell you how many times i rented this film during my childhood, but i did because there was something about it. i didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous, but sadly long gone amicus film company were a good start.pros: a grand, eerie music score. strong performances from a stellar cast. brilliant cinematography. plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills, especially in the first and last vignettes. some haunting moments and images. moves at a slow, but stead pace. the house is one spooky, oppressive dwelling. great production design and set decoration, which give the film a real old gothic horror feel. depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills.cons: some pacing issues in the first half. aside from the 'the cloak,' the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before. clichés galore. the second story, 'waxworks,' has fine acting and it's moments, but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense. the low budget really shows at times.final thoughts: after seeing this film for the first time in many years i can see why i rented it so frequently. it's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. watch this one with the lights off.my rating: 3.5/5

the british production company amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies, and this great omnibus called "the house that dripped blood" is doubtlessly the finest amicus production i've seen so far (admittedly, there are quite a few that i have yet to see, though). "the house that dripped blood" consists of four delightfully macabre tales, all set in the same eerie mansion. these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere, and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable. peter cushing, christopher lee (cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever), as well as denholm elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film - so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it? no one, of course, and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast. "the house that dripped blood" revolves around an eerie rural mansion, in which strange things are happening. in four parts, the film tells the tales of four different heirs.the first tale, "method for murder", tells the story of horror novelist charles hyller (denholm elliott), who moves into the house with his wife. after moving in, the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation... the first segment is a great kickoff to the film. the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good.in the second story, "waxworks", retired businessman phillip grayson (peter cushing) moves into the house, and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town... the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this, and the rest of the performances are also very good. the tale is delightfully weird, and the second-best of the film, after the third.the third tale, "sweets to the sweet" is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four. john reed (christopher lee) moves in with his little daughter. the private teacher and nanny mrs. norton, whom mr. reed has employed to instruct his daughter, is appalled about her employer's strictness towards his daughter, and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father's views on upbringing may have... this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot. christopher lee is, as always, superb in his role. nyree dawn porter is also very good as the nanny, and my special praise goes to then 11-year-old chloe franks. this ingenious segment alone makes the film a must-see for every true horror-fan.in the fourth segment, horror-actor paul henderson (jon pertwee) moves into the house with his sexy mistress/co-star carla (ingrid pitt). this fourth story is satire, more than it is actually horror. it is a highly amusing satire, however, and there are many allusions to other horror films. at one point henderson indirectly refers to christopher lee, who stars in the previous, third segment...all four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere. as stated above, the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest, but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate. an igenious atmosphere, a macabre sense of humor, genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must-see. in short: "the house that dripped blood" is an excellent horror-omnibus that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss. highly recommended!

this movie is good for what it is, and unpretentious; i wouldn't watch it twice, however: i am a peter cushing completist and that's why i watched it. the best asset of this movie is: brevity and effectiveness. compared to other similar movies, it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four (plus one) segments lasts under 30 minutes, with the last under 10. good uncanny vibes. in the first segment, horror writer suffering from 'writer's block' relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration. he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen. plot contrivance similar to premature burial. good use of the point-of-view twist: is the writer getting mentally ill...or (as the ending shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's phobias to drive him mad & secure his estates...yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan?in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth, which had once separated them. from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer...or was she?the third segment was the less interesting to me.the fourth shows a horror movies actor -who thinks he's the best of all- sunken to the depths of low budget c movies. seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets the real deal. this segment also lacks the solidity of the first two.acting is fair, with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it. good movie, taken with a grain of salt. not the best cushing, nor lee...but worth watching.

the british horror film was in terminal decline by the start of the seventies, but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best our island produced. the wickerman, blood on satan's claw and the house that dripped blood made the future seem rosy, even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasn't going to be one. thtdb has the sort of cast that could easily form a wishlist, if it hadn't actually been assembled, in the bleak hinterland of 2008 you may well find yourself expecting to wake up. waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is, naturally, my favourite, cushing's life and art are interlinked so firmly that you can't tell where performance ends and pain begins. one can only guess how this role affected such a gentle, sensitive man. death and the maiden. rip peter.

yes, this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! that's because although the film clearly was horror, some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs. this isn't at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious. because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good, it's one of the better movies of this style i have seen.the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants.the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writer's block. so, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. almost immediately elliott's block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer. amazingly, soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind. this might just be the best of the stories, as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive.the second, while not bad at all, is probably the weakest. peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary). when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this. later, a friend (joss ackland) visits and he, too, sees the figure and is entranced by it. this all leads to an ending that, frankly, was a bit of a letdown.christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl. during most of this segment, lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his demeanor. though slow, this one ended very well.the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. jon pertwee (the third "doctor" from the dr. who television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula. however, nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique, he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film. it's actually pretty interesting that he played this role, as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (give or take a few). i enjoyed pertwee's line when he basically said that lee's and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosi's! perhaps this is why lee didn't take this part! despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment.considering that the film started and ended so well, had excellent acting and writing, it's hard not to like this film.

no-nonsense inspector hollaway (a solid turn by john bennett) investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house. first and most mundane tale, "method for murder" - successful author charles hillyer (nicely played by denholm elliott) is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he's writing about in his latest book. although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be anything special, it does nonetheless build to a real dilly of a genuine surprise ending. second and most poignant anecdote, "waxworks" - lonely philip grayson (the always outstanding peter cushing) and his equally lonesome friend neville rogers (the splendid joss ackland) both become infatuated with the beguiling wax statue of a beautiful, but lethal murderess. third and most chilling vignette, "sweets to the sweet" - quiet, reserved and secretive widower john reid (a typically terrific christopher lee in a rare semi-sympathetic role) hires nanny ann norton (the fine nyree dawn porter) to take care of his seemingly cute and harmless daughter jane (a remarkably spooky and unnerving performance by the adorable chloe franks). this stand-out scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress franks, who projects a truly unsettling sense of serene evil lurking just underneath a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic veneer. fourth and most amusing yarn, "the cloak" - pompous horror movie star paul henderson (delightfully essayed to the haughty hilt by jon pertwee) purchases a mysterious cloak that causes him to transform into a vampire whenever he wears it. this item makes for good silly fun and further benefits from the awesomely pulchritudinous presence of the luscious ingrid pitt as enticing vampiress carla. director peter duffell, working from a deliciously macabre and witty script by noted horror scribe robert bloch, maintains a snappy pace throughout and does an ace job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere. kudos are also in order for ray parslow's crisp cinematography and the shuddery score by michael dress. highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare.

i'll admit to being biased when i reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series. i saw this film for the first time in ~2005 on the late night "fear friday" on amc, which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations. i made it a point to watch the entire amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure i had perspective. looking back, i still rate the house that dripped blood as my favorite, followed closely by tales from the crypt and then asylum.i think all of the elements that make this series charming---the vintage '60s/'70s style cinematography, creepy to kooky, far-fetched tales and the utter britishness of it all right down the backing music----came together better here than any of the others overall. the movie centers around a very old english country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within.the first story involves a horror writer and his wife, who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion. he creates a murderous character called dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction. there is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that i found amusing yet creepy. oh and those horrible prop teeth (then again these are british actors, maybe those were real!!!) the second story is the tale of a lonely old man (peter cushing) that has moved here to escape his loneliness, yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love. he seems to have found possible salvation at a local (very creepy) wax museum, but it turns out he would have been much better off alone.......the third story includes the great christopher lee (my fav british horror actor) as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter. he is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't---like witchcraft! she has a natural talent for it, with good reason. lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian, that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth!! but despite his best efforts, the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow......this final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film, right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular. so he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more "authentic". little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak! putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects. by the time i had gotten to this fourth and final story, it was after 3 am and i couldn't quite stay awake on the first try (not from boredom). but i did experience something that i have hundreds of times, a curious bonding experience i have with films or music when i drift in and out of sleep and the film/music becomes part of my dream!! great fun!! this bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because i woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first. not long after, the lovely ingrid pitt, a costar on his movie set, came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight---but he needn't have bothered, for she was a real vampire herself. the chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical!! and again in my half-asleep state, seemed rather confusing! side note: make sure to catch lee and pitt along with the stunning amicus star britt ekland in the all time classic film the wicker man (1973). the weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories, but based on the stories themselves, this is a classic! objectively, i would say the third story is best, but i like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much.very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a british horror fan, it's mandatory! i'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can. the last film of this series, monster club (1980) is certainly the weakest. i think the first 3-4 films except for the at times mediocre torture garden (1967) are the best, but if you like any of them, you should watch them all at least once. you'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites.

this movie is another horror anthology. it is rather good, but it could have used a bit more. i compare it to "doctor terror's house of horrors", though in this one the title fits. it has four stories all somewhat connected by a house. the first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in. he creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house. this one is sort of predictable, but it does throw a few twists in the end. the next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where the heck it is going. this one features peter cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch. this guy buys the house, but it is not the house that takes center stage, but a rather strange wax museum. the third story starts out rather good and features christopher lee. this one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter. the problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough. it drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion. then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop. the actor really gets what he paid for. then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. though i was not very satisfied with the explanation as i don't think it really explained cushing's story much at all. i think they needed a bit more back story for that one. all in all though it was an interesting set of stories.

featuring a few of hammer's all-stars, this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of it's previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective, in search of a missing actor.story number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels. he creates a demented character named dominic, who's a very creepy looking strangler, and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes. after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot is introduced which frankly, didn't really work for me. i won't spoil it for you.the next story (the best in my opinion) stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson, a man who's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum(that deals in the macabre) where he's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. soon thereafter, an old friend(who also has a history with this woman) is in town for business and drops by to see him. the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye.story three stars one of my very favorites...christopher lee, who plays john reid. after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane, the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter. well come to find out...if she knew what lee did, she would have certainly understood.the final story is a rather light-hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt. after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career.overall, the pacing and direction were very good, as was the most of the performances. there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance. this one's a keeper, and comes highly recommended.

amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's, and this, from leading horror scribe robert bloch, is one of their best efforts. there are four stories, all worthwhile, but two -- "sweets for the sweet" and "method for murder" -- distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear.in "sweets", christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter (chloe franks) becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods. franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in "the innocents". this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage, occurring off-screen, is a moment of purest horror."method of murder" is about a horror novelist (denholm elliott) who is menaced by one of his own creations, the creepy dominic. this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror. dominic may or may not be real, so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting.the original poster art, featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing's severed head, was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear.

linking story: another first-time viewing for me and, again, this is one of the most popular of the amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why, though i realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; i certainly fancied director peter duffell's choice - death and the maiden (which, incidentally, is a classical piece by schubert that is heard in the film during the peter cushing episode) - a great deal more. though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget duffell had to work with. the latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and, frankly, it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him).now to the individual stories themselves: "method for murder": the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but, to make up for this, it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (tom adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother of boris karloff from the old dark house [1932]); also, it ends with a satisfactory diabolique-type twist, and features a fairly intense role for denholm elliott in the lead. that's all we need out of it, really."waxworks": for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; peter cushing and joss ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time, and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with peter cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand, and ackland's inexplicable inability - or unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of bunuel's the exterminating angel (1962)."sweets to the sweet": this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here, christopher lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding nyree dawn porter and the deceptive innocence of chloe franks (who appears as lee's daughter). the film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'. trivia note: chloe franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when i saw her i felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it. later, on reading her filmography, it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of agatha christie's "the mousetrap" in london's west end, which my brother and i were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the summer of 2002! needless to say, we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil, mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! "the cloak": a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new ones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and, at one point, christopher lee himself!; jon pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work; ingrid pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; geoffrey bayldon (made up to look like ernest thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience, i suppose - and, while some of the humor comes off as heavy-handed a' la the fearless vampire killers (1967) or theatre of blood (1973), it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering i had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film. as for the extras, beginning with the audio commentary: frankly, this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that i can remember listening to; jonathan rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director peter duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films, you're left rather expecting there to be more!) and, as such, it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. the featurette "a-rated horror film" is a worthwhile effort with peter duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid, if all-too-brief, contributions from producer max j. rosenberg and stars chloe franks, ingrid pitt and geoffrey bayldon. we also get film notes, reviews, bios and a poster/stills gallery which, again, are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that).

from the mind of robert bloch, of "psycho" fame, come four tales of twisty terror in this amicus anthology film, which, while not quite as much fun, or scary, as i would have liked, still provides for some decent genre entertainment.it's linked by the wrap-around story of a highly skeptical scotland yard detective (john bennett) who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; he's advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place, and our film is off and running."method for murder" has author charles hillyer (always delightful denholm elliott) haunted by his latest fictional creation, who has seemingly come to life. this sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments, and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement."waxworks" stars horror icon peter cushing as retired stockbroker philip grayson, who, along with old friend neville rogers (joss ackland) becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum. most effective in this episode is the dream sequence, although it's great as always to watch cushing. the final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking."sweets to the sweet" features another well-loved horror star, christopher lee, as john reid, who doesn't treat adorable moppet child jane (chloe franks) with too much kindness, and it's up to new companion / tutor ann norton (nyree dawn porter) to find out why. the mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently; the film-makers wisely don't tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family. the "dying" moments are particularly horrific."the cloak" has the most outright comedy of the four; jon pertwee, one of many actors to have played the role of dr. who over the years, is a lot of fun as a vain, temperamental horror movie star (in fact, he's the highlight of this story) who, infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low-budget film, goes out and buys his own cloak. said cloak has strange powers, which i dare not reveal here. sexy ingrid pitt is a welcome presence as pertwees' companion; one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing jab taken at none other than christopher lee!the wrap-up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as detective inspector holloway learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously.underscored by michael dress's unusual, striking, and eerie score, "the house that dripped blood" is an entertaining mix of stories; while i don't enjoy it quite as much as, say, "tales from the crypt", it's still good fun. capably directed by peter duffell, it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions, and is certainly a good film of its type.7/10

the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies. if the monster club is included as part of the series, this would make eight movies. although, that movie is very different from the others.i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens. my feelings for them today are just as strong.i spent many years trying to track down this movie. the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy. as great as though the movie is, i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it. it wasn't quite as good as i was led to believe. whilst better than its two predecessors, it's nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstrate.the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house. his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants. the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house. whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology. i couldn't help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor man's version of donald pleasance or ian hendry. i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role. we could have even had both here - one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent. they could, and i believe would, have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better.the movie contains four stories, each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house.the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories. he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler, even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing. soon after, he begins seeing visions of his own creation. some excellent direction by peter duffell, particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script. elliott's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story. the story ends with a semi-twist but i couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential.the second story sees peter cushing move into the house. he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of. cushing's performance really brings this emotionally-moving story to life. he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushing's loneliness. this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushing's mind. anyway, cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl. naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end. joss ackland plays cushing's rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushing.the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee - my favourite horror actor of all time - move into the house with his daughter. mr. lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here. he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all. he even brings in a school governess to educate her. the governess, played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances, tries to find out what is wrong. without giving too much away, i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. christopher lee's presence is truly electrifying in every scene he's in. chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie. the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story.the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that's what matters. jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house. he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies, seeing everything as cheap and fake, particularly the costumes. so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role. geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak. when pertwee puts the cloak on, he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire. pertwee's performance has to be seen to be believed. it truly is hilarious. ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger.the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story. this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house. the rest you'll be able to work out for yourself. as weak as the linking story is, it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending.i'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with peter duffell, the director, who really does his best with what he's got. i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies.overall, the house that dripped blood, despite its flaws is a must-see for fans of the amicus anthologies, fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies. if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes, check it out. you'll enjoy it!

given how corny these movies are, you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them. the movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there. the inhabitants were: author charles hillyer (denholm elliott (with hair!)), who gets haunted by one of his own creations; philip grayson (peter cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; john reid (christopher lee), whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor paul henderson (jon pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much into character."the house that dripped blood" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it stars peter cushing and christopher lee). aside from just being neat, there might be some undertones: it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs. assumed horror. like in "the shining", we might ask whether the house/hotel itself holds some memory of past events. and if absolutely nothing else, ingrid pitt (as paul's co-star) is hot hot hot! around the time that this came out, she also starred in "countess dracula" and "the vampire lovers" (also with peter cushing). maybe she - like barbara steele - will remain known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: she is a hot scream queen! i'd like to see ingrid pitt and barbara steele co-star in something.i guess that the only weird scene (so to speak) is where denholm elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. you read that right. what kind of a name is "denholm" anyway? oh well. a very cool movie.

four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful, old mansion and what happens to them. the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life. some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good. the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife. the third has christopher lee who has a child (chloe franks) and is scared of her. it all leads up to a pretty scary ending (although the ending in the story was much worse). the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt (both chewing the scenery) and a cape that turns people into vampires! there's also a cute line about christopher lee playing dracula.this is a good horror anthology--nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills. also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire! also the house itself looks beautiful...and very creepy. it's well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches. a very good and unusual movie score too. all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out. try to see it on dvd--the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.

four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical scotland yard investigator holloway (john bennett) as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped blood.one can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is the house that dripped blood'. this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers. incredibly, the number of depictions of violence on-screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination, all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence. in a rare feature of early seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless, from the faultless performances of the star-studded cast (featuring the legendary peter cushing, christopher lee and ingrid pitt) all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter duffell and master of the macabre writer robert bloch (the author of the novel psycho'). the only real complaints that one may have with the house that dripped blood' are the somewhat asinine plot-twists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture, but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.the first segment, entitled method for murder', tells the story of charles hillyer (denholm elliott), a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel. while working on the novel, hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality. elliott's performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability. the key to this segment, as with the others, is the mystery surrounding the events that take place. the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a hallucination, a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there. duffell's direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow, methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling.the following segment features peter cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house. during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in. while there, he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him. cushing's character (philip) is then joined by his friend neville (joss ackland) who also wishes to visit the museum, much to the dismay of philip. in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark. there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story. duffell's direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories, there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting waxworks' is still a delightful entry into the film.waxworks' is followed by what is, in my opinion, the greatest of the four segments  sweets to the sweet'. christopher lee stars as john reid, the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny ann norton (nyree dawn porter). however, john appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family. sweets to the sweet' is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer. throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family, but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place. this is the best example of how duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great. accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack, sweets to the sweet' is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease. personally, i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare 10/10.the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in. jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie. pertwee's character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries. however, strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst. this segment, which places the inspector amongst the events, is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology. although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is, in a way, what makes the story so enjoyable. unfortunately, there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features. horror buffs should definitely look out for pertwee's brief comment on bela lugosi's and christopher lee's portrayal of dracula. this slightly comical and light-hearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspense-driven horror.to sum up, the house that dripped blood' is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast, great stories and above par direction. there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed, fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely. my rating for the house that dripped blood'  8/10.

horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. i'm not very fond of them myself, but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of british horror cinema. the house that dripped blood is a horror omnibus, featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a scotland yard officer by an estate agent.this film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema; peter cushing, christopher lee and ingrid pitt, whom horror fans will recognise as one of lee's co-stars in the greatest british horror film of all time; the wicker man.the first segment of the film, titled "method for murder" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named "dominic" is brought to life by his own imagination. this story builds suspense very well; through his girlfriend, he, and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination. this story certainly isn't very original, but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise.the second story, titled "waxworks", stars peter cushing and is my least favourite of the four. this tale follows the story of phillip grayson (cushing), a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. inside, he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. quite what the woman's relationship with phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. cushing is later joined by his friend, neville rogers (played by joss ackland) and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. the setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn't a new idea; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film, "chamber of horrors". although the one here isn't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film, the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect, much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the limited area of the museum. peter cushing is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. despite being my least favourite, this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down.the film continues with "sweets for the sweet", which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. this story stars the legendary christopher lee as a seemingly overprotective father. the beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. it leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter, but we don't know who, or what, it is. christopher lee, as usual, portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll, and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys. the card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which lee tells his babysitter that he is, in fact, afraid of his daughter. the ending to this section is superbly played out, in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told, and will stay with you long after the end credits roll.the omnibus finishes with "the cloak", which is definitely the most comedic of the four. this tale is about a hammy horror film star that, unimpressed by his latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak. naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. unlike the other three tales, this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. that is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. the ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film, which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. also, look out for the little jibe regarding christopher lee in dracula. a nice touch, i think.overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with the house that dripped blood. the third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed.

i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty 'blood rites'. as blood rites was entirely awful, i really wasn't expecting much from this film; but actually, it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation. the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; there is an inheritance at stake. the film is shot in black and white, and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic 'the curious dr humpp'. there's barely any gore on display, and the director seems keener to focus on sex, with themes of incest and hatred seeping through. the acting is typically trashy, but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation, director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing, as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful. the plot is paper thin, and most of the film is filler; but the music is catchy, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, as most are somewhat erotic. overall, this is not a great film; but it's likely to appeal to the cult fan, and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'blood rites'.

say what you want about andy milligan - but if his family was even 10% as deranged as the one in this film, well then i guess he could have turned out worse. unfortunately, the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture's box office appeal. several times during the film milligan's ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends, and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for milligan's homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60's guitar rock. it's pretty easy to fast-forward through if you're trying to pay attention to milligan's original film, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes. what remains, however, is still compelling stuff. i don't think i've ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before.

years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie theaters's in between the actual features along with a newsreel of current events, plus cartoons, especially on a saturday afternoon. (the parents loved it mostly) "the return of chandu" was a 12 episode serial where chandu,(bela lugosi),"the mysterious mr. wong",'34 is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of egypt,(nadji)maria alba,"dr. terror's house of horrors",'43. princess nadji is held captive by the black magic cult of ubasti, who believe that she is a reincarnation of their long-dead goddess ossana. these 12-episode serials take you way back in time and are very well produced, considering we are talking about 1934 !

how truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi. it is disarmingly friendly and lively. it's the document of a longlost craft. (the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) chandu is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic . it refreshes the mind. it's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. chandu has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun.without giving away too muchchandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.as to the quite sexy niece, nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti: the sordid vindhyan. the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals. would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu does?lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only contributed to his performances. he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosiyet burton's biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. i enjoy lugosi' fancy performances.this serial is unjustly bashed.

bela lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film where lugosi played the villain.) lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way. here chandu returns from the east in order to help the princess nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult. this is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun. to be certain the pacing is a bit slack, more akin to one of principals (the producing studios) features then a rip roaring adventure, but it's still enjoyable. this plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that "hey i missed something". one of the trilogy of three good serials lugosi made, the others being sos coast guard and phantom creeps

to a certain extent, i actually liked this film better than the original vampires. i found that movie to be quite misogynistic. as a woman and a horror fan, i'm used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre. but they just slap sheryl lee around way too much. in this movie, natasha wagner is a more fully-realized character, and the main bad guy is a gal! arly jover (who played a sidekick vamp in blade) is very otherworldly and deadly. jon bon jovi... okay, yeah, no great actor, but he does ok. at least he doesn't start to sing. catch it on cable if you can. it's on encore action this month.

the main problem of the first "vampires" movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic. carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blade's deacon frost. unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't carpenter use more of this??) this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been. i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence (for example inside a city) and was left somewhat disappointed. while "los muertos" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as "vampires" did). much like "vampires" however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense.most of the above may sound like "los muertos" is a bad movie but it definitely isn't. it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii. it simply could have used a bit more excitement.i'd really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it's probably not going to happen.spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable. una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual.

i admit that i am a vampire addict: i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten. i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it. this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first, and it is not quite so dark, but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original.jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss: his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives. one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems. his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds.the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film. it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night. there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme.if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one. if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.

almost too well done... "john carpenter's vampires" was entertaining, a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects. and obviously aiming on the "from dusk till dawn"-audience. "vampires: los muertos" tries the same starting with a rock-star jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters, but does that almost too well...: i haven't seen jon bon jovi in any other movie, so i am not able to compare his acting in "vampires: los muertos" to his other roles, but i was really suprised of his good performance. after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing "it' my life" or something, but kill vampires, showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done. this means a lot, because a part of the audience (also me) was probably thinking: "...just because he's a rockstar...". of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest: it could have been much worse, and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance. the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killer-machine of a vampire-leader we met in part 1 (or in similar way in "ghosts of mars"). jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy, moving as lithe as a cat, attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin, light almost transparent very erotic cloth. and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made. it really takes some beating. but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnau's "nosferatu". you can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original. this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point: the audience celebrating the fun-bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun-bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed. make no mistake: "vampires:los muertos" is a fun-bloodbath but it's just not all the time this kind of movie. just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins: the bar-massacre is what you expect from american popcorn-entertainment, the seducing-zoey-in-the-ruins-scene is almost european-like cinema (the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress, but refuses answers at the same time. because it would had slow down the action? showed the audience a vampiress with a human past, a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody). and that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not. and also: is the "from dusk till dawn"-audience really going to like this? i'm not sure about that. nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job, "vampires:los muertos" is surprisingly good. but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative, too expressive. like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience. in my opinion, wallace' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time. "vampires: los muertos" is almost too well done. (i give it 7 of 10)

at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance as derek bliss. his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films (the leading man, no looking back). but, in case anyone is still wondering, yes, jon bon jovi can act. he can act well and that's come to be expected of him. it's easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh-1.i generally would not watch a horror movie. i've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot. what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along. the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets. so, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not.unlike an action film like u-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know "the good guys" and actually care what happens to them. a few scenes are left unexplained (like derek's hallucinations) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel. unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film, that sequel will never happen. these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series.is this the best film i've ever seen in my life? no. is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? yes. it won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either. if you're somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover, this film is for you. it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other.

my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter's vampires but i don't care i loved it. jon bon jovi (derek) was great in this movie. he really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous rockstar. there were some bad things about this movie. like the story line,there should have been more to the movie.there should have been a sequel to the movie that followed the movies story line and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampires movies. i really liked the clothes that the people wore and the setting they pick in mexico. i liked how it was old mexico and not new mexico. with the clay houses and the old fashion churches. i was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to walk in churches but it was cool how they didn't follow dracula vampire rules.

the original vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. i was quite surprised at how this played out. as a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. though this one was not a great movie, the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. jon bon jovi was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent slayer. i doubt anyone could top james wood's performance in the first one, though... unless you bring in buffy!all in all, this was a decent watch & i would watch it again.i was left with two questions, though... what happened to jack crow & how did derek bliss come to be a slayer? guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination.

well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems. being a self confessed horror fan i sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect. after 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared (quite rare). the film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story. yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but the creep is a class act and proceeds to slash and dismember anything that comes its way. message for ladies !!! there are certain parts of the film you should close your eyes at or at least cross your legs !! you will understand when you see it.all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares

- small spoiler herein! - when i looked at the votes for "creep" today, i was surprised about so many imdb-users rating this movie "1". i am wondering: what do people expect of such kind of movie? are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it?"creep" is a horror movie and it is a pretty good one! this automatically means: it has a absurd story full of holes, outrageous hazards and simple one-side-characters. so why complain about it? just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then... ...enjoy to be scared to death! the first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring. there is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you. (in my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie.)when kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie. the second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (...as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the discovery channel!) so, if you want to make yourself a very, very scaring hour. just watch the first hour of "creep" and then leave the cinema or turn of your tv. you know the rest of the story anyway, don't you? the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor. but even if you watch this movie up to its end, you will not be disappointed....and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what i did after watching this movie: leave the cinema by dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home...

christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick 'creep'. 'creep' although a little bit loose on information, proves itself worthy of a true gory classic. a little less glossy than recent us horrors (amityville horror remake, house of wax remake) this dark and gruesome tale follows kate (franka potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she, and a number of others along the way, try and flee a murderous attacker. though some bad reviews have slated this film, i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that 'creep' truly does live up to its name. it delivers fast-paced gory action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best character-reaction-at-the-end i've seen in a while, 'creep' delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares.

this film exceeded my expectations. i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish, so i wasn't expecting much. however, i was pleasantly surprised. at first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died. after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character. it's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason. there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film, but explains a lot. i would recommend this film to everyone. if you're not sure just watch it anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. you're going to live for 80 years anyway.

firstly, i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense.creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. the actors are highly believable, the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. there is much mystique in this film. many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. how was 'craig' created and what happened to him?a fantastic film with a large chill factor. a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later, the bunker, dog soldiers and deathwatch.look forward to more of these fantastic films!!

creep is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. and it does just that. nothing more, nothing less. director christopher smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked. he also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague (unlawful experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at) and that little bit of mystery works for the most part. sadly, he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear (they are hinted at as well). yes, you heard me right - i wanted a clichéd twist ending! franka (run lola run) potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine.

"creep" is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous! it has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. what it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me for one second. when the end-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer christopher smith (in his debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the "creep" in the london subway. the story revolves on the young and haughty kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney who's in town to present his new film. she falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. even experienced homeless people, security guards or sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! i really dug the creep-character! he's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. i reckon this isn't very original, and i'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content, but i forgive smith and i think it's better this way than going over the top completely, "jeepers creepers"-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). the obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! there's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used. there also is some acting-talent present in this film, with franka potenta (run lola run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film "anatomie". creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director i'll keep an eye on. make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film...

star rating: ***** unmissable **** very good *** okay ** you could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs stuck-up career bitch kate (franka potente) heads to the london underground to catch a train to take her to meet george clooney. however, after a hectic working day, she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform. as she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next, however, she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there.in a lot of ways, the british film industry is really becoming one on it's own, especially in the horror thriller department, with films such as creep and the successful 28 days later (which this has strong echoes of in parts.) in terms of succeeding in what it set out to do, creep does cleverly create (especially at the beginning) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear. at it's clever running time, it also (though inadvertently, i suspect) manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through-out without really focusing too much on character development and such.of it's weaknesses, some scenes are a little predictable, but these don't really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way. i'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it's not exactly perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serves it's basic function very well. ***

i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section. to tell you the truth, the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song, and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didn't have a choice :-d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs, but it turned out to be semi-gore flick. somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable, and that is absolutely correct. i really couldn't care less if potente's character got her entrails ripped out by the creep. i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potente's character getting her just desserts. christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film. however, the story is rather weak, but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively. the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch. that, more than anything else, really scared the crap out of me.the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the q&a session. i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future.this one is strictly for genre fans, but i'd recommend non-fans to give this a try anyway. it was a fun ride.

this is good little shocker; not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but tight, competent and disturbing. an excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.the set up requires no bells and whistles, no lengthy exposition or wordy back story; kate (franka pontente), a young german business woman living in london, drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train. she awakens to find the place deserted, but quickly comes to realise that she is far from alone. someone, or something, is down there with her and it's intentions are wholly malicious.in fact she encounters several other characters in her quest to survive, including a lecherous work colleague, a homeless couple and a caged sewage worker, all of whom add pace and substance to the plot. there is a slightly awkward gear change somewhere in the middle of the film when tension thriller mutates into gore fest, but nothing so clumsy as to slow the hectic pace. for those of you with weak dispositions this is likely to be a harrowing ride; for those of you who relish a bit of well executed carnal mayhem this should press all the right buttons.the climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film, but it is punctuated with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary which provides a satisfying conclusion.some may find themselves feeling somewhat cheated of a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by kate and her confederates, however, for me this was not the case. a horror film writer should not need feel compelled to dot every i and cross every t, in the same way a writer of political thrillers might be expected to. there are enough clues here to give you a very pretty clear idea of what brought this evil into existence, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. the retention of a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the ride was always going to be more important than the exact destination.my understanding is that the budget for this film was, to say the least, minimal, in which case our applause for this british horror should be all the louder, for at no point does one have the impression of corners being cut or effects failing to deliver.if this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is. buy a ticket and climb aboard.

1958. the sleepy small southern town of clarksburg. evil sheriff roy childress (the almighty vic morrow in peak nasty form) cracks down super hard on speeders by forcing said offenders off a cliff to their untimely deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road. childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver michael mccord (a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by martin sheen) shows up in town in his souped-up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (sheen's real-life sibling joe estevez in a brief cameo). director richard t. heffron, working from a taut and intriguing script by richard compton (the same guy who directed the 70's drive-in movie gems "welcome home, soldier boys" and "macon county line"), relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, neatly creates a flavorsome 50's period setting, and ably milks plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and wills between childress and mccord. the uniformly fine cast helps a lot: sheen radiates a brash james deanesque rebellious vibe in the lead, morrow makes the most out of his meaty bad guy part, plus there are excellent supporting performances by michelle phillips as sweet diner waitress maggie, stuart margolin as a folksy deputy, nick nolte as amiable gas station attendant buzz stafford, gary morgan as buzz's endearingly gawky younger brother lyle, janit baldwin as sassy local tart sissy, britt leach as stingy cab driver johnny, and frederic downs as the stern judge j.a. hooker. the climactic vehicular confrontation between childress and mccord is a real pulse-pounding white-knuckle thrilling doozy. terry k. meade's sharp cinematography, the well-drawn characters (for example, childress became obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident), the groovy, syncopated score by luchi de jesus, and the beautiful mountainside scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made-for-tv winner.

i caught this movie about 8 years ago, and have never had it of my mind. surely someone out there will release it on video, or hey why not dvd! the ford coupe is the star.......if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away.

martin sheen, michelle phillips, stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. mr. sheen, mr. margolin and mr. morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles; ms. phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made-for-tv movie (twenty-five years ago), by supplying the "sex interest" in an otherwise sexless film. the real star, however, is the "california kid"; a 1934 ford coupe, borrowed from "jake" jacobs, put before a camera and given a workout that'll leave the viewer panting, gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation.the action scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialog is a bit lame) making for a fine evening's diversion. this is how all "car movies" should be made.try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it's well worth the missed sleep.

for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et. al., martin sheen showed us the way in this great feature.the premise is easy enough: cool hood meets small town sheriff and all-hell ensues, but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us. no, this isn't casablanca, nor is it great literature, but it is a serious movie about cars, rebellion, and the genius that is martin sheen.enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is, and for what martin will become. i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70's, and you will too.

i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. it is far superior in action than most movies since. martin sheen is excellent, and though nick nolte has a small part, he too provides excellent support. vic morrow as the villain is superb.when sheen "tests the water" in his '34 ford (cool) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!the ending is grand.i'm disappointed in the low vote this received. i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days.good taste eludes the masses!

in 1958, clarksberg was a famous speed trap town. much revenue was generated by the sheriff's department catching speeders. the ones who tried to outrun the sheriff? well, that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the clarksberg curve with his plymouth cruiser. for example, in the beginning of the movie, a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths, if i recall correctly. then one day, a stranger drove into town. possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world. michael mccord. even his name is a car name, as in mccord gaskets. in possibly the ultimate hot rod. a black flamed '34 ford coupe. the colors of death, evil and hellfire. he gets picked up for speeding by the sheriff on purpose. he checks out the lay of the land. he is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. he knows how his brother died. the clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff. there's only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so "this ain't a-ever gonna happen again to anyone": recreate the chase and settle the contest hot-rodder style to the death. he goes out to the curve and practices. the sheriff knows mccord knows. the race begins... this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road.

viewing "impulse" is a very satisfying experience. unpredictable films are such a rarity, when one comes along like "impulse", it is something to embrace. the script is logical, and extremely creative. meg tilly, tim matheson, hume cronyn, and bill paxton, give believable performances. this could have played out like a zombie movie, but "impulse" is far superior to any boring "zombiefest", and originality shines through in almost every scene. you get the feeling that something like this could have actually happened, even though the script is pure fiction. from the "grabber" opening till the credits roll, you will be fascinated. very entertaining and definitely recommended. - merk

im not a big tim matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film.it was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy,i don't know were to classify this film its a bit sf and a bit horror slash thriller.i saw this at about 2.00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it.if you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad,the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better.i don,t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for tv or went straight to video,i for one would buy this if it,s on dvd it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the x-files story attached to it.government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings.overall a good film.

i saw this movie back in 1984, we first started watching "this is spinal tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. so we went instead to see this movie. if you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head, you will want to watch this one. the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are: do you think the government would be capable of doing this? (in my opinion there is no doubt that they could) but i don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself.but, just to let you know, we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do.

i saw this movie on tv late one night years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day.the premise may seem a bit unoriginal - due to an earthquake, a hidden underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is breached, and a microscopic amount of the substance finds its way into their food supply. the inhabitants of the town begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint over every whim and base desire that floats through all of our minds from time to time, and that normally we know we simply must not act upon.the pace of the movie is slow, but for me that only added to the creeping unease as the townspeople's behaviour slowly starts to unravel. there are several surreal and very unsettling scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time.it raises interesting questions about what we could all be capable of if we gave in to our most feral instincts. did i enjoy it? i'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word. did it make me think? definitely. i'm still thinking about it. scary stuff.

ok, first of all, ignore the last person' review. they admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on!!! as thriller/horrors go, this film ain't too bad, it is certainly very watchable. right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the craziness that follows, and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clear.i enjoyed this movie, it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable. great to watch late at night! i give it a generous 7 out of 10.

i think that that creator(s) of this film's concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received. it isn't an oscar caliber film of course, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 (in the theatre). i don't think this is (and hope it isn't) a spoiler, but: imagine acting on your impulses. doing the first thought that pops into your head, saying the first words on your lips... no restraint, no conscious, nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that, as intelligent adults, we know we shouldn't actually say or do. if anything, this film only scratches the surface - it doesn't go as far as it could go. in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older "classics" to try and cash in on today, wouldn't it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success, for the sake of taking it to the next level? a bit further, or even to explore what the original crew didn't, wouldn't or couldn't deal with 20 years ago? that's just my opinion anyway. :o)

i think that the movie was kind of weird. in the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. he doesn't get mentioned again. the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie. it isn't the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie. i give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale.

your average garden variety psychotic nutcase (deliciously essayed with unhinged glee by stephen sachs) knocks off various dim-witted young "adults" (to use the term very loosely) in dayton hall university, which is being closed down for demolition. featuring dreadful acting by the entire cast (daphne zuniga makes her ignominious and inauspicious film debut here as debbie, a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car!), a hefty corpse tally of 10, okay make-up f/x by matthew mungle, a few bloody murders (baseball bat bludgeoning, chicken wire strangulation, your standard drill through the head bit, that sort of gruesome thing), a downbeat surprise twist ending which was later copied in "intruder," a creepy score by christopher ("hellraiser") young, a slight smidgen of gratuitous female nudity, and endearingly incompetent direction by jeffrey obrow and steve carpenter (who also blessed us with "the power" and "the kindred"), this entertainingly abysmal slice'n'dice atrocity sizes up as a good deal of delectably dopey and drecky low-grade fun.

don't believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives. yes, it is cheaply made. yes, the gore is laughable. and, yes, the acting is sub-par. however, this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick, and if that is your "thing" (its mine!) then you will enjoy this one. there are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks. for one, the score by a then unknown christopher young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly. the ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies. and last, but not least, the setting is what made the film for me. the makers of this film could have done a much better job "dressing" the set to make it more believable as a college dorm. however, if you can overlook this flaw, the setting is great. four collegiates all alone in a huge, abandoned, condemned building just waiting to be torn down.... it reaks of possibility. when watching, allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as i did.

not a bad word to say about this film really. i wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly. i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories, mine being one of them. the film delivers in the shock, gore and atmosphere department. the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus. it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business. the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard, if a little wooden in some spots, and the effects are very real and gritty. all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book. i've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's p.o.v shot. and i ask: what's wrong with that??? it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret. the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist(killer revealed) is not handled with more care, i mean it just happens kind of quickly, though the great performances make it just about credible. aside from that pranks is a great movie (though i prefer the original title) and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap. its more than that, but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher. what a shame.... its a really good movie people! believe me!

college girl joanne murray takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments,which includes selling the unneeded furniture this takes place during a break,so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly-empty premises on campus."dorm that dripped blood" is a low-budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining.the acting is pretty bad,the plot is predictable,but the gore effects are quite good.the film was made by ucla film students stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow for next to nothing.soon a dreamy ambiance kicks in,very similar to the enveloping forests of jeff leiberman's fantastic "just before dawn".7 out of 10.it's great to see daphne zuniga of "the initiation" fame run over few times by a car.

i am surprised at imdb's low rating of this movie. with all due respect, its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor. they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more gore.the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film. it is not, nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one. it is a psychological thriller. it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. reel.com's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie. all the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense. it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it.i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense. martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning. the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing.i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone. i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare.kudos to the acting as well. for such a low budget film, you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction, writing, and acting. please don't be fooled by the rating by imdb. this movie is worth it. i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice.

this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold. it's horror-- but not a splatterfest. it's equal part suspense as well as horror-- yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera. the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters.forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe. that's a red herring. he is acting here. 'camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story. adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance-- so she must believe the script has something to say. we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap "cut" and get their paychecks. this is not the case, here.forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-funny regularity. i don't think the intent was humorous-- but to keep you off balance. think of it less of a horror 'movie' and more of a horror 'play' on a stage-- that decrepit whitewashed house. then you might see it's really about paranoia, fear, and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace, usa.and it is twisty. time travel, mind control, secret experiments and nazi's who may not be dead. . .yet.i say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down.

the main problem i see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, "this is a cheap-ass movie." there's not much more to say here. the score just plain sucked.the second problem, which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between martha (adrienne barbeau) and the sunflower man (richard ziman), in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. at all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. in other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau. while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. the main point of her performance that didn't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo-like woman on a mission. this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon barbeau. to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.so what's my holistic grading of this piece? i'd give it a solid c+ to b-, depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism. i see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and nicholas brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance.all in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a nazi you love. :)

i've read some terrible things about this film, so i was prepared for the worst. "confusing. muddled. horribly structured." while there may be merit to some of these accusations, this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer. in fact, it actually had aspirations. it attempted something beyond the typical monster/slasher nonsense. and by god, there are some interesting things going on.ms. barbeau is a miracle to behold. she carries the film squarely on her shoulders.this is not to say that it's a masterpiece. unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition. there are just too many (unexplained) subplots trying to coexist. and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother, then why doesn't she just kill ma in the film's very first sequence? seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do it.still, i give unholy points for trying. a little ambition is not a bad thing.

there's something about every "hammer" movie i see that really takes me into a new fantasy world. in the world of "hammer" movies, anything can happen. "guardian of the abyss" is one of those types of movies. it adventures deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring a different type of horror fantasy. all in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5/10.

i love occult horror, and the great british hammer studios, who delivered one of their greatest films with "the devil rides out" (1968), have proved to be more than capable in this field of horror. this occult tenth episode of hammer's short running tv-series "hammer house of horror" (1980), "guardian of the abyss", is indeed a creepy entry to the series. director don sharp, who had previously enriched the hammer oeuvre with "the kiss of the vampire" (1963) and "rasputin: the mad monk" (1966) and furthermore directed two "fu machu" movies starring christopher lee, is doubtlessly one of the better-known names among the hhh directors, and he also delivers here. antiques dealer michael (ray lonnen) stumbles over a mysterious old scrying glass. the scrying glass happens to be the object of desire of a devil-worshiping cult, who want to use it for their satanic rites. when he shelters a beautiful young girl named allison (rosalyn landor), who is to be sacrificed by the cult, michael gets into deeper trouble with the cult and their sinister leader (john carson)... while this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of "hammer house of horror" (the best one clearly is the brilliant seventh episode, "the silent scream"), it is a very creepy and atmospheric one. the plot has several interesting twists, and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film. ray lonnen makes a good lead, young rosalyin landor is convincing as the innocent beauty, and john carson is truly creepy as the leader of the satanists. overall, "guardian of the abyss" is another interesting and creepy hhh tale, and my fellow hammer fans should not miss it.

whoever said that horror wasn't an educational film genre, huh? thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie, i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house, because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts & mind forever! thank you hammer! the tenth episode in the house of horror series is another one i've been looking forward to seeing, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was don sharp; one of britain's finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated. sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films, like "kiss of the vampire" and "rasputin: the mad monk", as well as some overlooked independent productions like "dark places" and "psychomania". his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes. the plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror, but it's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon choronzhon; the demonic guardian of the abyss. the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies, but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. when he picks up a clearly petrified girl who's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed, michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy. satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics, but david fischer's screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits, among which a highly inventive climax. there's also plenty of tension to admire, the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid (especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie). recommended!

the young dr. fanshawe(mark letheren), an avid archaeologist, is dispatched by his museum boss to the large country home of squire richards(pip torrens), where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the squire. the squire is surprised by the arrival fanshawe, he hadn't been expecting him for another week, but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant, patten (david burke..of dr watson fame), to show him to his room, as fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task. patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawe's visit will entail, the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking, cleaning and maintenance for him. fanshawe is a fussy sort, very neat and precise with everything having its place, whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room. needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work, but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit, so he asks the squire for a replacement pair, the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters, is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house, so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages, there the squire directs him to points of interest, including gallows hill, where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours, his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin, but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn't, he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants? fanshawe doesn't have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched, he feels a presence, he begins to see moving shadows in the woods, startled he runs home. over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire, patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it..the binoculars! they used to belong to a local man called baxter, whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill, boiling them up for some concoction or other, baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night, the late squire had acquired his belongings, including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area. these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars, but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches, never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power. that night he has horrifically vivid dreams, when he wakes, he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them, what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so? fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession, as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist, they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill, they quicken their speed, but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny? the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with the ice house, they were for the most part based on the work of the great m.r. james. in 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james, whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers. director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films, but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story, his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax, all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum, thus upping the tension and mystery. the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere, the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come. the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles. the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see, may even have influenced álex de la iglesia in his film la habitación del niño (2006) of the following year, with which it bears striking similarity. i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film, but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers, something that doesn't happen much these days, i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing, which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow. plenty of time is given, even within its brief 40 minutes running time, for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade.

this adaptation of m.r. james's short story 'a view from a hill' was first shown on british television in 2005, on the little watched digital channel bbc 4. i saw that it was being repeated again on bbc 4, and decided to give it a go, remembering the bbc's successful 1970's adaptations of other m.r. james stories including 'whistle and i'll come to you my lad' and 'the signalman'. though not in the same class as these masterpieces, 'a view from a hill' is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama.a historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts. whilst out in the countryside, he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. but what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named gallows hill? and what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation? whilst not scary in any way, i enjoyed this little production, and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation. as it is, it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome.i give it 7 out of 10.

i must confess to not having read the original m r james story although i have read many of his other supernatural tales. i've also seen most of the previous bbc christmas ghost stories and this one, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, only equalling the signalman.i can't really fault a view from a hill - the direction and 'mood' is perfect, as is the acting, lighting and, of course, the story and writing. i thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team. i understand that the bbc plan to make some more (not necessarily based on m r james stories) so that's promising.10/10

i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay. i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called "the fear:halloween night". i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy. but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people(including his mother) and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit. pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first.

those of the "instant gratification" era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count. the fact is, "the empty acre" is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done.if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back-story could have come off the back of a count chocula box, "the empty acre" is the movie for you.set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream, "the empty acre" is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. as the couple's weak relationship falls apart, a larger story plays out in the background. at night, a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path, leaving no sign that it was ever there.the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening, and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer/director's faith in an intellectual audience.there seems to be a sub-text concerning the death of the american dream, but i would hardly call the film an allegory. riveting, well acted, and technically astute, "the empty acre" is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love.

budget limitations, time restrictions, shooting a script and then cutting it, cutting it, cutting it... this crew is a group of good, young filmmakers; thoughtful in this script - yes, allegorical - clever in zero-dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have, relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time, devotion, locations; and getting a first feature in the can, a 1-in-1000 thing. these guys make films. good ones. check out their shorts collection "heartland horrors" and see the development. and i can vouch, working with them is about the most fun thing you'll do in the business. i'm stymied by harsh, insulting criticism for this film, wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue, pondered one thought or concept, or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience. let "the empty acre" bring itself to you. don't preconceive what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror/thriller genre due to its supernatural premise. it's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that doesn't assault your brain's visual center, but rather, draws upon one's empathetic imagination to experience other's suffering of mind and spirit. mark ridgway, curtis, "the empty acre"

this is what i call a "pre sci fi; sci fi" movie. it gets no better than lugosi/karloff in this incredibly good "mood" type motion picture. these two genuine artists are at their very best, as is the story line.karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity, pride, and scientific competition. i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts. i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in. this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake. this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role. it might be possible to do it almost as good.this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced. as i said..it gets no better. no way.

so many consider the black cat as the best karloff/lugosi collaboration. i disagree. the invisible ray is their best. a great storyline, fantastic special effects, and classic karloff over-acting. i love it!!

"the invisible ray" is part science fiction and part horror. it was also the third of seven karloff/lugosi features. in this entry the dominant role goes to boris karloff.through specially designed astronomical equipment, dr. janos rukh (karloff) demonstrates to colleagues dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), sir frances stevens (walter kingsford), his wife lady stevens (beulah bondi) and their nephew ronald drake (frank lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the african continent many millions of years in the past. rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to africa to find the mysterious element.rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names "radium x". due to rukh's long absences, his comely young wife diana (frances drake) becomes attracted to drake and the two fall in love. meanwhile rukh becomes contaminated by radium x to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. the contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.rukh goes to benet for help. benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.while rukh is continuing his work, sir frances takes news of the discovery back to france. diana and ronald accompany him. when benet informs him of this action, rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. when he returns to france he learns of the healing power of radium x as he cures his mother's (violet kemble cooper) blindness and of benet's work in curing the maladies of his patients.but rukh's madness intensifies. first he murders an innocent man whom is identified as rukh. upon hearing of rukh's apparent demise, diana and ronald marry. this angers rukh and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition. one night he is lured into a trap set by benet and...........karloff is excellent in the lead role moving from a happily married ambitious scientist to a raving maniac. lugosi has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part.at 79 minutes this film was the second longest of the six karloff/lugosi collaborations. karloff's film all the way.

one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray. boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd (especially the camera technique karloff, as janos rukh, uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and downright laughable, i didn't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. the effects are done well for the time, the acting is great, and the finish is particularly strong. it reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s, complete with ray guns and ridiculous science. you must watch this movie!

really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest, boris karloff and bela lugosi. dr. janos rukh(karloff)is on an expedition in africa trying to find an ancient meteorite. after finding it, rukh is poisoned by the its radiation. all he touches dies and the dark side of rukh makes him become an egotistic murderer. his friend, dr. felix benet(lugosi)finds a limited remedy to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases. the two fiends will battle over the radiations possibilities. pretty good special effects. others in the cast: frances drake, frank lawton, beulah bondi and frank reicher.

the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial. karloff plays dr. janos rukh, creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the carpathian mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe.before several guests, including lugosi as dr. benet, an astro-chemist who had previously scoffed at rukh's theories, he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element, here termed "radium x", contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago. karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories, but radium x is a tricky compound - it levels mountains at long range, and cures blindness at short range. rukh is careless, however, and poisons himself, glowing in the dark rather like those old ready breck commercials! dr. benet is on hand to devise a counter-active for the radiation, but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid. convinced he has been cheated, he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris, including his estranged wife, and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death...along the way we get the old pseudo-scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer (a remarkably distinct karloff!) and the radium x device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members. and even a touch of james whale in a cockney landlady in paris!the invisible ray is great fun, aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris. the film lacks pace, but is always absorbing. karloff slightly overdoes his performance but lugosi is terrific. universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster, this time with lon chaney jr. as the glowing menace (this time caused by electricity) and lionel atwill as a much madder doctor than lugosi is here. the invisible ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire. not as famous as other universal horrors, perhaps, but it works and is highly entertaining.

horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre-lover to watch a film, and, even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci-fi/horror gem. while lambert hillyer's "the invisible ray" of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff ("frankenstein, "bride of frankenstein", "the mummy",...) or lugosi ("white zombie", "island of the lost souls", "dracula",...), or both ("the black cat", "the raven",...), this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing. compared to other universal horror pictures, the storyline seems a bit silly, but in a delightful manner. karloff and lugosi, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography. karloff plays dr. janos rukh, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago. stunned by rukh's invention, the celebrated french scientist dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor. in africa, rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike... it is somewhat odd that karloff, who was in fact british, plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi, who was hungarian, plays a french scientist, but they are both excellent as usual. as far as i am concerned, these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory, and i am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the horror genre, and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre. by the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff. frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh's beautiful young wife. the rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. other than the casting of karloff and lugosi, the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline. my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance. he is fantastic as always, but his role could have been bigger, and more sinister. otherwise, "the invisible ray" is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror/sci-fi cinema, and a must-see for all my fellow lugosi/karloff fans.

scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. all (pseudo)science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there, including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed. when he summons his rivals -who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they propose a 'joint' expedition to africa...of course they end up stealing much of dr. rukh's original discovery, giving him only residual credit. in addition to that, an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst abbot&costello (lawton) literally steals dr. rukh's young trophy wife (drake), who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being. having grown horns like a deer wasn't going to make dr. rukh (karloff) any friendlier, so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission...killing 2 of his foes and friendly dr. benet (lugosi), the only one who had helped him...finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but ( to my utmost dissatisfaction ) sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married. acting is mostly fine, with karloff & lugosi being very good. check the hysterical chambermaid scene... other characters aren't worth mentioning... recommended, much like all old universal horrors...

prof. janos rukh (boris karloff) discovers radium x--a powerful force to be used for atomic power. unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death. dr. felix benet (bela lugosi) develops an antidote--but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him.the plot is silly and the "effects" that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable, but this is still a fun little chiller. it moves quickly, has some great atmosphere (notice rukh's "house" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and karloff and lugosi (as always) give great performances. there is also good acting by franic drake (as rukh's wife) and violet kemble cooper (as his mother). so it's ok but just a notch below all the other karloff/lugosi movies. the plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. still i did like this. i give it a 7.

the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein; and there's a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and the invisible ray is certainly one of them. the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director lambert hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film. the plot focuses on the good hearted dr janos rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth. his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it. however, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him mad...the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - boris karloff and bela lugosi, and both give excellent performances. karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with. bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in, and it's a great performance from him also; it's nice to see a bit of versatility from lugosi. the film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up. the second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well. the film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely. overall, the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but it's a very good one and comes recommended.

boris and bela do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.i saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from borders this year. this time watching it with my children,i took note of 2 things: it held the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it.very swift story with an unpredictable end. a must for movie buffs!!!

there are so many good things to say about this “b” movie.“b’ maybe in connections, but not in commission. this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen. a grade a effort by universal. the script is well done, imaginative, and without fault. writing credits: howard higgin original story & douglas hodges story, john colton (screenplay). director lambert hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well. no skimping on the loads of extras and locations. i loved beulah bondy (jimmy stewarts mother in “it’s a wonderful life”. the fem lead, frances drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her karloff husband. lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in. as i said there were so many good things: the african discovery of the radium “x”, the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the ten little indians in and then there were none (agatha christie) (the barry fitzgerald version)), the glowing of karlof in the dark. karloff’s mother played by violet kemble cooper with elegance. and because of all these virtues, i found myself believing in the science it portrayed. i guess that’s the mark of a good piece of art.

for real film people, this film is a must, since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. janos rukh/boris karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. this light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good. on the one hand it blinds his mother, on the other it is used to cure blindness ("i can see!" shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected). when rukh/karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are out).there is a wonderful passage near the beginning where karloff/rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years, as the light from andromeda was emitted from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. there are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the persona of beulah bondi/arabella stevens; and religion, emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun. one has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in germany at the time, and particularly at riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm:triumph of the will. happily in the end, mother (violet kemble cooper) intervenes, reminding janos rukh of the first rule of science. if only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout: "i can see!"

while not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as the black cat and the body snatcher), this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd. boris karloff plays dr. janos rukh, a weird scientist who lives in the carpathian mountains--near where the dracula character's home town. bela lugosi plays dr. benet--whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french. i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles, as the carpathian role seems tailor made for lugosi--especially with his accent. however, despite this unusual twist, the two still did excellent jobs. karloff's was definitely the lead role, but lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person--something he didn't play very often in films!! it seems that dr. rukh is a bit of a pariah, as other scientists (especially benet) think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical. however, over the course of the film, rukh turns out to be right and benet is especially generous in his new praise for rukh. but, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (don't you hate it when that happens?). while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story, the plot was well constructed, the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting.this film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger-budget film instead of the cheap quickies both lugosi and karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. good stuff.

okay, note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd-collections: i truly am grateful and i hugely support the initiative, but  have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection? when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role ("tower of london", "the strange door"). "the invisible ray", however, is part of the bela lugosi collection and here it's actually boris karloff who overshadows bela! this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead! bela lugosi's character is quite possibly the most good-natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here. "the invisible ray" features three main chapters. the first one, set in dr. janos rukh's carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience, but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film. dr. rukh (karloff) demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues (among them bela lugosi as dr. benet) how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self-manufactured device. the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa. there dr. rukh isolates himself from the group, discovers the essential element "radium x" to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself. the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one, as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks (melting statues) and a surprising climax. karloff glows in the dark and, convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life, he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch. the narrative structure of "the invisible ray" sounds rather complicated, but the film is easy to follow and entertaining. the story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director lambert hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense. boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi, even though he deserved to have a little more screen time. their scenes together are the highlights of the film, along with the funky images of the glowing boris.

with a special telescope, dr. janos rukh (boris karloff) successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in africa containing an unknown, but extremely powerful element. dr. benet(bela lugosi) form an expedition led by rukh to locate the element. unexpectedly, rukh discovers "radium x,", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them. the sparks really fly between lugosi and karloff in this classic science-fiction film during the post-world war ii era. director hillyer used a few standing sets from "flash gordon" series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from frankenstein. universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film. karloff and lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations.

boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together, but on the whole (interestingly enough) karloff usually is the better man of the two. the real exception is "the black cat" (1934) where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult, and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life. but more usual is "black friday", where (whatever his motive) karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug. in "the raven" lugosi is a sadistic surgeon, who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough. rarely are they both negative characters totally. in "the body snatcher", karloff does kill lugosi, but lugosi is trying to blackmail him.the one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film, which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned. in it karloff's dr. janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the "official scientific community" for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago. he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens (walter kingsford and beulah bondi), and has another scientist, a frenchman named dr. felix benet (lugosi), rukh's young wife diane (frances drake) and a friend and protégée of the stevenses named ronald drake (frank lawton).before they leave, rukh is warned by his mother (violet kemble cooper) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy. he tries to dismiss this, but he is worried by what she says, his scientific standing, and whether or not he is going to get his due credit.what he gets is a disaster. he finds the substance, but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity. he finds that he is slowly burning up, and if he tries to touch people or animals they die. he's actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet, who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger. but there are two things that are unbeatable here. the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time, and has to be replenished. and the radioactivity has affected rukh's brain. he is increasingly jealous of diane's friendship with ronald (encouraged, unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella), and he is equally upset that (due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that) benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that "radium x" is giving to man. soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives, ending with his own.the film certainly picked up on science to an extent. madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium. few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936, but some idea of it was coming out. the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a "curse" on the expedition. of course, with the idea of a "cursed" expedition (on the continent of africa) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago, financed by a titled englishman, we have entered archeology not physics or geology (paging howard carter and lord carnaevon).on the other hand, benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths, and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england. during the whitechapel murders, sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper. it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. but the idea did not die. jules verne used it in his novel "the brothers kip" in 1899, and here dr. benet uses it. as this is a science fiction story, he finds the image of rukh on the the plate, but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters.the film is good on many grounds, the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other. there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films. the other performances are good as well, in particular ms kemble cooper. she is best remembered as basil rathbone's frightening sister (jane murdstone) in "david copperfield". here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end, and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target.

there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s, the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films. after being universal's "first monster" in the seminal classic, "dracula", bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent (sadly, this last factor would also led him to be type-casted during the 40s). in the same way, boris karloff's performance in james whale's "frankenstein" transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster. of course, it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen, and the movie that united them was 1934's "the black cat". this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade, and director lambert hillyer's mix of horror and science fiction, "the invisible ray", is another of those minor classics they did in those years.in "the invisible ray", dr. janos rukh (boris karloff) is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda. while showing his invention to his colleagues, dr. felix benet (bela lugosi) and sir francis stevens (walter kingsford), they discover that thousands of years ago, a meteor hit in what is now nigeria. after this marvelous discovery, dr. rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa, looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor. this expedition won't be any beneficial for rukh, as during the expedition his wife diane (frances drake) will fall in love with ronald drake (frank lawton), an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition. however, rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip, as he'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor.written by john colton (who previously did the script for "werewolf of london"), "the invisible ray" had its roots on an original sci-fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges. given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi, colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story, playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up. one element that makes "the invisible ray" to stand out among other horror films of that era, is the way that colton plays with morality through the story. that is, there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style, but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices. in many ways, "the invisible ray" is a modern tragedy about obsessions, guilt and revenge.a seasoned director of low-budget b-movies, filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles. thanks to his experience working with limited resources, hillyer's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains, and "the invisible ray" was not an exception. while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films, hillyer's movie effectively captures the essence of colton's script, as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci-fi. finally, a word must be said about hillyer's use of special effects: for an extremely low-budget film, they look a lot better than the ones in several a-movies of the era.as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff, the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality. as the film's protagonist, boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes. as his colleague, dr. benet, bela luogis is simply a joy to watch, stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was. as rukh's wife, frances drake is extremely effective, truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress. still, two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh, and beulah bondi as lady arabella, as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time, making unforgettable their supporting roles. frank lawton is also good in his role, but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast.if one judges this movie under today's standards, it's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience. however, that would be a mistake, as despite its low-budget, it is remarkably well done for its time. on the top of that, considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept, it's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate. one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters, specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr. rukh and the cold dr. benet, as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors.while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the "frankenstein" movies, nor the elegant suspense of "the black cat", lambert hillyer's "the invisible ray" is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures' catalog of horror films. with one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror, this mixture of suspense, horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had: boris karloff and bela lugosi. 8/10

the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi. karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even his wife. his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends. this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. it is hard, however to hear his accent and believe he is french. the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science" but, in a way, even the junk science makes it work well. since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are as "relevant" today as they were when the movie was made. and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be. this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again. i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times. the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing. i highly recommend it.

this is just about in the same league as `the black cat', although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9+. that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing!`the invisible ray' is part horror, part drama and certainly part sci-fi. for a movie made in 1936 the sci-fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. the mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend, while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better.director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often. what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot. the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. it's a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre.as with `the black cat' and `island of lost souls', i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd. when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling.anyway, watch this film if you get the chance. when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library.

one doesn't get to enjoy this gem, the 1936 invisible ray, often. but no can forget it. the story is elegant. karloff, austere and embittered in his carpathian mountain retreat, is janos rukh, genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in africa. joining him is the ever-elegant lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "astro-chemistry." frances drake is the lovely, underused young wife; frank lawton the romantic temptation; and the divine violet kemble cooper is mother rukh, in a performance worthy of maria ospenskya.the story moves swiftly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still handsome. it also contains some wonderful lines. one rukh restores his mother's sight, he asks, "mother, can you see, can you see?" "yes, i can seemore clearly than ever. and what i see frightens me." even better when mother rukh says, "he broke the first law of science." i am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is.this movie is definitely desert island material.

karloff and lugosi - together again! this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much. it's not an all-out horror film like the duo's previous two hits, the black cat and the raven. but, it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when re-visited.the invisible ray was directed by lambert hillyer, a director who mainly made westerns, but curiously in these final days of the laemmles' reign at universal, he found himself helming this and the laemmles' final horror film, dracula's daughter. both are crisp, clean-cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements.just as lugosi went wild in the raven, much needs to be said of karloff's hamming in the invisible ray. the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that karloff's character, rukh, acts so madly before he is poisoned by radium x, that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing. this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining - he's basically a loony right from the start. there isn't any real transformation. same here. halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind. i still enjoyed his performance, though, just as i did lugosi's over-the-top antics in the raven.meanwhile, lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained, and thoughtful turn as rukh's rival in science, dr. benet. lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh, of which i am in alignment with horror film writer john soister on - "and if he (rukh) touches anyone?" the inspector inquires. lugosi hesitatingly replies, in a way that only lugosi could deliver, "they die". just as lugosi could be so off, he could also be more perfect than any actor. this is one of those moments.therefore, karloff and lugosi's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff pared off against the cool logic of lugosi. karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times, however, one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one. he only had one more chance (ninotchka).the invisible ray is a fun film, and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans. it is one of those films that improves on each viewing, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story complements the darker, more horrific pairings they had. the special effects, by the always innovative john fulton, are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate. frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman, something seldom seen in classic horror films. the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film. a terrific, fun film!

besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is: 1)stanley kubrick 2)god allmighty 3)the rest... this movie actually is better than the book (and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat, considering the director). the flawless filming stile, the acting and (kubrick's all time number one skill) the music - make it the masterpiece of horror. i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it. it blew me away!!! it is far better than i ever imagined it. it starts slow (kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense. the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film. also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that i hate in recent day horror films. just watch it!

that's right. the movie is better than the book. don't get me wrong, i love the book. but the movie is just so much better. this film has jack nicholson and shelly duvall at their best. (i haven't seen scatman crothers and obviously danny lloyd in anything else.) some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book. but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series. but, i missed a few. the film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot. and the redrum scenes are creepier than those in the book. so if you're looking for a great movie, get stanley kubrick's the shining. but count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks

why can't more directors these days create horror movies like "the shining"? there's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not stanley kubrick. kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.so, the plot is fairly simple. a man named jack torrance (played brilliantly by jack nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls. what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what i mean.this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as "scary". it's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. music has been a major part of kubrick's movies (2001: a space oddysey and a clockwork orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it.finally, i must comment on nicholson's legendary performance. jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. in fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie. this is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. r.i.p. stanley.

kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on stephen king's book titled the same way. jack torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. the overlook hotel in colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. but, the manager advised torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. even before they got there, his son danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go. once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. at this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to danny, and someone who attacked him violently. they are not alone in this place. later on, jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, delbert grady. grady tells torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. obeying this order, jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things i've ever seen happen here. the ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.

everyone should totally see this movie! it's freaking scary, but doesn't resort to lame "jump-out-at-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" things. it really is great. see this freaking awesome movie!!! the director is stanley kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. every single one of his movies are masterpieces, including this one. the shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the colorado rockies as caretakers for the winters, and get snowed in. well, the house is haunted. the kid is psychic. the husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels, and...well...hilarity ensues!!!! not really. it becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions, and it gets scary. not just the classic, "here's johnny" scene. it's memorable, but can't speak for the whole movies. it's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately, and you just gotta see it. so go on netflix, and get it! geeeeeetttttttt itttttttt!!!!!!!

the shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel, written by stephen king, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work. this is due to two factors: stanley kubrick's masterful direction and jack nicholson's chilly acting.nicholson plays jack torrance, a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period, unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice, isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family: jack, his wife wendy (shelley duvall) and their five-year old son danny (danny lloyd). the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: he has been told by the cook, dick o' hallorann (scatman crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy, the titular shining, which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future, among other things. because of this "gift", the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny, even though he is quite capable of resisting them. that is not jack's case, however, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick, though having never worked on this kind of film before, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't, hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. king criticized the director for changing most of the story, omitting most of the jack/danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment is valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit in an unconventional way, and redemption is a theme kubrick, one of the most famous analysts of human decay, never had a soft spot for. what he is interested in is the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).another criticism king raised was about the actors, especially nicholson: in the writer's opinion, his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane, thus undermining the rest of the story. now, it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning, but it is equally true that martin sheen (king's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholson's: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal "here's johnny!" scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isn't bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoo's nest star. as for duvall and lloyd, both add terrific support, the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens (the omen's damien) and haley joel osment as cinema's great horror child icons. one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run, but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the "scream queen" cliché wasn't one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera, making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendy's eyes.irvine welsh, the author of trainspotting, once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know, given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen), yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad. the shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, is included in the film, but in kubrick and nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest, most original horror pictures of all time, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form.

at times, this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film. while carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. it's one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. i try not to compare it to the book  which i've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. it's almost as if kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening. and it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made, as well as one of the greatest horror films.what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time. it's the destruction of jack torrence. some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film, given his past roles and his appearance. i disagree. we know he's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and jack's appearance only furthers this notion. but it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. he's calm, quiet, patient. he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family. and with a wife and son as irritating as his, it's a small wonder that he manages to do so. but once he gets to the overlook, he changes. he becomes irritable, angry, on edge. the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing, and he utterly loses it, telling her to "leave him the f*** alone". this is the first f-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system. from then on, all bets are off.another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film. we're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that he may as well be talking to himself. but what of the other characters? wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while danny connects with the place almost immediately. his psychic powers are not in question  how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel?  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness? it's easy to claim that jack merely loses it, being trapped in a hotel with his family, and wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of danny? it appears that his body is taken over by tony, but how do we know for sure? none of these characters are reliable witnesses. hallorann probably would be, and he warns of the dangers in 237, but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook (a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). and that final shot. has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? has jack really been there before? or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? when talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson. shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose, to give jack's character more of a reason to snap  and danny lloyd is no better, but jack is a powerhouse. part method, part improvisation, he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing. for better or for worse, he's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid or nagging wife. we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be able to do whatever we want. who cares if it's haunted? of course, the technical aspects are terrific. kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. the use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. and don't even get me started on that score. i don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself.i know king doesn't like this film, but king's input on cinema is nothing to brag about. as great of a novel writer he may be, his screenplays are terrible, and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. this is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it doesn't need to be, and it really shouldn't. part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material. kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. if only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. and it's got everything else on top of that.

"nothin'. there ain't nothing' in room 237. but you ain't got no business going' in there anyway. so stay out. you understand? stay out." never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves. this is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so. jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema.its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months over the winter. then the father (jack) becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel.kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect. the tense tracking shots, agonising music, mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made.throughout the film there is constant references to danger, death and horror. red is used in every scene. is the red purposely put in by kubrick? of course!.this is a definitive kubrick classic and this is the third of his films i have given 10/10. he is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films. he loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films.i will be talking about this film for months to come. it has infinite depth.in conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. a masterpiece of terror 10/10

kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film. mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. of course it doesn't hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances i've ever seen. a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. duvall and lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (scatman crothers).

the shining starts with jack torrance (jack nicholson) driving to an isolated hotel named the 'overlook' situated high in the colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager stuart ullman (barry nelson) about becoming the winter caretaker. ullman tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in. together with his wife wendy (shelley duvall) & young son danny (danny lloyd) jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine, it's a beautiful hotel, absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal. however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't. as the days, weeks & months begin to pass jack become more & more insane, danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family, as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped jack finally loses it...this english production was co-written, co-produced & directed by stanley kubrick & is a fine horror film. it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length. the script by kubrick & diane johnson, is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i can't compare them, goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film. there are very few character's in the shining with jack, wendy & danny the only ones that really matter, since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them, become involved with them & what they go through. the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout. on the negative side i don't think the reasoning behind jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me, the fact that jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & i don't know if i missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever, i'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about! there is very little in the way of violence or gore, a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story. with a budget of about $19,000,000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick, the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors, the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners, basements & cobwebs kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors, massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor (well 80's modern, just check that red toilet out!). the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & nicholson seems crazy from the very start. the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i'm not sure i'd watch it again anytime soon. for those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed, for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you, well worth a watch in my humble opinion.

when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubrick's other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would be.at times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film. now some people don't like kubrick's version of the shining since it doesn't entirely follow stephen king's book but in my opinion both kubrick's version,the mini-series and the book are all great.jack nicholson gives an awesome performance.if you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining.

... this isn't the first time stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. in dr. strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing ("five months of peace is just what i want... ") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.i disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on jack torrance in the filmed version. the cues nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. the environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. in much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. he may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is jack nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. when he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. if you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines...

*!!- spoilers - !!*before i begin this, let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the "authorized version" of this movie, remade by stephen king, himself, in 1997.both advantages made me appreciate this version of "the shining," all the more.also, let me say that i've read mr. king's book, "the shining" on many occasions over the years, and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work, stanley kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling ... and scary.kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film. in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title "magus" beyond question. kubrick's genius is like magic. the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. among his other outstanding credits are: eyes wide shut, 1999; full metal jacket, 1987; barry lyndon, 1975; a clockwork orange, 1971; 2001: a space odyssey, 1968; spartacus, 1960 and many more.the torrences (jack, wendy his wife and danny, their son) are living in the overlook hotel for the winter; jack has been hired as the caretaker. it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the overlook reopens its doors. it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. it lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time "welcoming" atmosphere, itself. the furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook, it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world.the introduction of wendy and danny's characters was a stroke of genius. you get the whole story of their past, danny's "imaginary friend," tony, and the story of jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene. there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, kubrick saw that from the beginning.closing day. again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the "staff" is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. "they did a good job! pink and gold are my favorite colors." (wendy torrence) even the "staff wing" is well designed and beautifully built.the maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian. when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing wendy and danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting. "i wouldn't want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out." (the hotel manager)scatman cruthers, as dick halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. you could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and "doc." his explanation of "the shining" to danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel. it was believable and sincere.the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie. it also marks the "half-way-to-hell" point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.shelley duvall's portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful. (so what if she also played olive oyl?! it just shows her marvelous diversity!) honestly, before i saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, i said," what? olive oyl? *lol* (popeye was also released in 1980.) but i took that back as soon as the movie started. she's brilliant. in this fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date! (although i did love her in steve martin's "roxanne," 1987.)once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession: the torrence's past; danny's broken arm; tony; the history of the hotel itself; the fact that danny is not "mental," but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, delbert grady (the girls having appeared several times to danny, first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time. they were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.kubrick's tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father. he was..."the little boy who lives in my mouth." he would manifest in the end of danny's finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny. not like in the book, i realize, where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony "took ... danny ... over." the idea of danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.the "woman in the shower" scene, done by lia beldan (about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and billie gibson (who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting. it was dramatic, and frightening. abhorrent and scary. when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real.jack quickly embarks on his trek from the "jonesing" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person. the degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick. jack's instant friendship with lloyd the bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ..."hair of the dog that bit me." (jack torrence) in jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to jack. "orders from the house." (lloyd the bartender) nice play on words.when wendy find's jack's "screenplay" is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, "how do you like it?" and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant. it's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up jack is. it's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence. that coupled with danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between jack and wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie.the "redrum" scene. wow. what do i say? what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming "redrum" over and over? even if it had no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of hell. it was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed). speaking of memorable scenes...nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history. his ad-libbed line, "heeeeere's johnny!" was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. it also goes down in horror movie history.the ending..? kubrick's ending was perfection. i felt it ended beautifully. no smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie. just epitomized perfection. that's all i'll say on the subject of the ending.who cares what was taken out?! look what kubrick put in. rent it, watch it, buy it. it's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. it rawks!!*me being me* ... take this movie, and sitck it in your stephen king collection, and take the 1997 "authorized" version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section. that's where it belongs. .: this movie rates a 9.98 from the fiend :.

sometimes it takes a film-making master like kubrick to bring that extra little something, that unique, untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece, one for the ages.it's not just that stephen king's story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss. heck, even king himself didn't fare so bad. it's how kubrick perceives king's universe, how he transforms the page into screen time, that renders the shining both a visual feast and a compacted masterclass in directing.kubrick's miss-en-scene is, as usually, terrific. the movie progresses with a brisk, sharp, lively pace, even though it's neither fast nor heavily edited and it clocks at no less than 160 minutes. the camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur. there's a symmetry and geometrical approach in how kubrick perceives space that reminds me very much of how japanese directors worked in the sixties. as if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame.certain images definitely stand out. the first shot of jack's typewriter, accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball, like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself, later on proving to be nothing short of just that. a red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in slow motion. jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. the ultra fast zoom in the kid's face thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his pov. and of course, the bathroom scene.much has been said of jack nicholson's obtrusive overacting. his mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's jack nicholson. the guy looks half-mad anyway. playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever had. coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies (3 women, thieves like us, nashville), she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress. a terrific and very underrated actress.

even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old, i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack nicholson's descent into madness. this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. the twins, the elevator of blood, redrum, the crazy nonsense "writing"... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. the film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. and it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.

the shining, you know what's weird about this movie? this is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that the shining is a terrific film. this is stanley kubrick's classic vision of stephen king's horror tale of madness and blood. this is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. who could forget jack's "here's johnny!"? who could forget "all work and no play make jack a dull boy"? who could forget that chilling ending? this is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is kubrick's best work. i know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: a space odyssey or clockwork orange or even dr. strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then the shining perfected it. this is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. jack torrance, jack's son danny, and jack's wife, wendy arrive at the overlook hotel on closing day. the elderly african-american chef, dick hallorann, surprises danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. he explains to danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication "shining." danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly room 237. dick tells danny that the hotel has a certain "shine" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. danny's curiosity about room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after jack tells wendy that he loves his family. seeing this, wendy thinks jack has been abusing danny. jack wanders into the hotel's gold room where he meets a ghostly bartender named lloyd. danny starts calling out the word "redrum" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. he goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is tony, his own "imaginary friend." jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but hallorann has received danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. wendy discovers that jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating "all work and no play makes jack a dull boy" formatted in various ways. horrified, jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. jack converses with grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. danny has written "redrum" in lipstick on the door of wendy's bedroom. when she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is "murder" spelled backwards. jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. "here's johnny!", and jack's legendary image is born.the shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. jack nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. but one i also feel is extremely overlooked is shelley duvall, her scene of finding jack's rant all work is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. also another incredible scene is when jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. the reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection, it's been on the simpsons, it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it, trust me.10/10

okay, okay, maybe not the greatest. i mean, the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but the shining is way up there. it is, however, by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie. it's better than the stand, better than pet sematary (if not quite as scary), better than cujo, better than the green mile, better the dolores claiborne, better than stand by me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than the shawshank redemption (shut up, it's better), i don't care what the imdb top 250 says. i read that, a couple of decades ago, stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (i tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was the shining. and thank god, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.stephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. jack nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as jack torrance (how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`heeeeeere's johnny!!'). shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jack's desires to kill her. stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.one of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack, wendy, and danny talking in the car, in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv, as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on tv (`see? it's okay, he saw it on the television.').the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. and being a stephen king story, you expect something to jump out at you. i think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. he looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. anyway, you get the point. the shining is a damn scary movie.besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. had jack always been there, like mr. grady told him in the men's room? was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? if he has always been the caretaker, as mr. grady also said, does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not mr. grady, after all? it's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. for example, the amityville horror, which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter, did this. but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of kubrick's movies are). one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for, and we should thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.

i was never a big fan of horror movies. they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon. it was well-acted, and had a great story. but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubrick's the shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.the movie follows a writer (jack nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. after months of solitude and silence however, jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes. the hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. it is also eerily calm when jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. jack nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project. it may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10

chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. this movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. one of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. the setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. the quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in jack torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. i always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. this film is a perfect example of this very thought.and it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. i have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, i am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that i have ever seen. i thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, i am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe i should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. all in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.rating: 9/10

hey now, i can't claim to have seen all of the films of jesse (jesus) franco, and there sure seem to be a lot of them, but this is one of the better (and weirder) of the lot that i have seen. i'd say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties/early seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me, and it takes a lot for me to declare that. anyway, this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points. this woman is an actress or something, performs in some theater in berlin where acts of "fake" torture are performed for an appreciative audience (?!) and she seems to have this problem with dreaming. the catch to what's real and what's not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isn't. she seems to exist in a state of deja vu. i won't say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining. shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place, so that adds to the atmosphere. the ending is extremely abrupt though, the film just ends and the tape went black, i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point. my copy was from the anchor bay euro-trash collection, and i say, give me more euro-trash, i can't get enough of that crap. but it's good crap.

delirious, near plot-less mood piece and if it's more lsd inspired than the devil then we must remember when it was made! after a startling sm opening (which even itself is not what it seems) we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or remembering. lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the franco film that lang himself praised. beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold. a rare movie to languish within. old jess could make 'em when he tried. fine central performances too including the indomitable jack taylor and howard vernon. i haven't even mentioned the lisbon locations - ah!

lorna green(janine reynaud)is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club. she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. it's quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin. after the murders within her fantasies are committed, lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco, i'd say it's elegant & difficult. by now, you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. and, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. i'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched "succubus", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it! some might say that "succubus" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, "venus in furs", considered his masterwork by franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. in a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, "succubus" is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on. and, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters. "succubus" is also populated by beatnik types and "poet-speak", corman's film, "a bucket of blood" poked fun at. my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually. great locations and jazz score..i liked this film myself, although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction. loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses.

as you probably already know, jess franco is one prolific guy. hes made hundreds upon hundreds of films, many of which are crap. however, he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation. "succubus" isn't his best work (thats either "the diabolical dr. z" or "vampyros lesbos"), but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog. he combines the erotic (alternating between showing full-frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination) and the surreal seamlessly. this is a very dreamlike film, full of great atmosphere. i particularly liked the constant namedropping. despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious, its amusing to hear all of franco's influences.still, there are many users who don't like "succubus" and i can see where they're coming from. its leisurely paced, but i can deal with that. more problematic is the incoherency. the script here was obviously rushed, and within five minutes into the film i had absolutely no idea what was going on (and it never really came together from that point on). those who want some substance with their style, look elsewhere. also, if its a horror film, it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful. still, i was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that i didn't really mind these major flaws all too much. (7/10)

i haven't seen all of jess franco's movies, i have seen 5, i think, and there are more than 180 of them. so maybe it's a bit early to say so but "necronomicon geträumte sünden" (better known as 'succubus', but that is the cut version) is according to me if not the best, certainly on of franco's best. franco is best known (although 'known' might be slightly exaggerated) for "vampiros lesbos", a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90's when people found out jess franco was also an interesting composer. through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of 'the lion and the cucumber' ('vampyros lesbos ost'): jess franco is an overwhelming director. when the phone rang during 'vampiros', i let it ring. i just wanted to see more of the movie. since that moment franco never could grip me that much. but then i stumbled on this movie. it is even better than "vampiros lesbos", i think. franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera. we find out he can do a lot. i certainly didn't expect to find "necronomicon" that great: its beginning didn't impress me at all. remember, i had seen "vampiros lesbos" before (although chronologically that came only three years later) and both movies kinda start the same. but then the story went on, puzzling and gripping, beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see godard do if he weren't so occupied with spreading his political messages. later on in the movie i heard a dialogue about which art was or wasn't old-fashioned. the man says that all movies have to be old-fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed. but the girl replies that "bunuel, fritz lang and godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow". janine reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course howard vernon, a franco regular, is also there. luckily the acting is good (something that can spoil a lot of franco movies for you, but not this one). but certainly watch out for the dummy scene. the erotic tension, the wild directing and the fact that it's a yesterday's movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see. the fact that it is a bit more accessible than "vampiros lesbos" certainly helps.

franco proves, once again, that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema. true, much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus (necronomicon) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work. jerry van rooyen's splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or may indeed (as one mysterious character states) be a devil, attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits. a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema.

emilio miraglio's "the red queen kills seven times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed. first of all, and of paramount importance for me, it has a complex, twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end. the story, concerning a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the film's title, right?) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, is an involving one, and the murderer, a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman, is both frightening and memorable. every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her earlier roles, sybil danning, as a lustful tramp at barbara's fashion house. another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. gorgeous scenery? check again. filmed largely in wurzburg, germany, the picture is a treat for the eye indeed. ok, ok, but what about those murders? after all, isn't that what gialli are all about? well, i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out...not to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and lots of 'em, too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of ugo pagliai, a hunky leading man for the female viewers. as i said, a perfect giallo. and even better, this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame, and you know what that means: a gorgeous print and loads of extras, to boot! thanks, guys!

when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing, you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work. undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay. speaking of gameplay, the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience. the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game. the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision. the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you.

not being a fan of first person shooters i was very hesitant to play this game. after having played the demo however i was sold. "undying" really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in. you have this green amulet,called the "gel'ziabar stone" that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at. with a special spell "the scrye" you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you. walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper:" look",with the stone glowing at for example a painting. and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting. let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell. people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats. this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around. because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark. and ghosts and monster appear at random when you don't expect them and can kill you very quickly. there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened. this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic "evil dead"! to experience something like this is a real accomplishment. there are a lot of elements that take "undying" to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced. but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws. for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge. you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hidden,secret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called "oneiros". that is all fine in the beginning. but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating. and there is no map. the game demands you memorize your surroundings. so patience is required. also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you can't progress. i don't mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures. but in first person mode that can be an annoying task. luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace. and trust me you will need it. overall "undying" is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan.

i gotta say, clive barker's undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made. i've played resident evil, silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements. barker is good at what he does, which is attach the horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at, undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title. i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud.

i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it. the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit, its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there. the sound effects and audio are amazing. there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not. you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic. the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you. if you want to get the full experience, try playing it with head phones on.

and here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror. emilio miraglia's "the red queen kills seven times" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences. it's a fabulous giallo (released in the golden year 1972) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of italian cinema. the storyline doesn't just introduce your average black-gloved & sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous "red queen". at young age, their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who, once every 100 years on april 6th, kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim. fourteen years later, kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins. sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the states recently... or has she? complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. her face can never be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim. she's not exactly gentle either, as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger, dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences! that latter one is truly one of the greatest (= most gruesome) acts of violence i've ever seen! what more could you possibly request? some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning. emilio miraglia isn't the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended "the night evelyn came out of the grave", but his influence and importance should not be forgotten.

undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups. it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena. the game is set in ireland after world war one so don't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers.all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on.our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time: he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left.so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game! the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p.c..level design is also cool and atmospheric. mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress. thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first person shooter) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent. but the game has two main flaws. first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration.secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry. as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced. most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult. overall undying is a great game. definitely one of the best fps out there.

this game was really great and quite a challenge. it has a great, spooky story line and the graphics are also very good. i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish. the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me. a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans.>

this is undeniably the scariest game i've ever played. it's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which i usually don't care much for), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround soundeffects ("scryeeee, scryeeee..") and above all incredible atmosphere. i love the scrye, which enables you, at certain places in the games, to see or hear events that happened there in the past. the only game i've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. i'm a great horror fan, escpecially of clive barker's stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1 because i'm no fps fan, and perhaps the game was a bit short?)

there are some films that every horror fan owes himself (or herself) to see, and emilio miraglia's "la dama rossa uccide sette volte" aka. "the red queen kills seven times" (1972) is definitely one of them. with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite sub-genres in horror, i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while, and even though my expectations were high, this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes. miraglia's earlier giallo, "the night evelyn came out of the grave" (1971) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror, but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite. "the red queen kills seven times" is, hands down, one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made, and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it. an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements, "the red queen" delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: an inventive and incredibly compelling plot, spine-chilling suspense, a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, eerily lush colors, stylish murders, a brilliant score, and, not least, a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror.the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany. as little girls, kitty wildenbrück and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting: legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people. fourteen years later, kitty (barbara bouchet) has become a successful fashion photographer. suddenly, people begin to get murdered... director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style, atmosphere and colorful creepiness with "the night evelyn came out of the grave" and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem. "the red queen kills seven times" is a feast for the eyes indeed, and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plot-wise. the haunting painting in the grandfather's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps. the red lady (or red queen, as she is called in the english title) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo, the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own. a sexy female cast is always appreciated, especially in a giallo, and this one is a prime example for that. the ravishing barbara bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen, and she is a great actress too. bouchet's presence has graded up many italian flicks, among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cult-masterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year (1972): fernando di leo's "milano calibro 9", lucio fulci's giallo-highlight "don't torture a duckling" and this unforgettable gem. apart from the wonderful miss bouchet, the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning, marina malfatti ("the night evelyn came out of the grave"), and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera. as the whole film, the murders are stylish and extremely elegant, yet frightening and macabre, and some of them are quite gory. bruno nicolai's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets, and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting. the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings, the tension-level increses with each passing minute. "the red queen..." begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second. overall, this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for. "the red queen kills seven times" is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made, and a top-priority for every fan of horror and/or italian cinema to see. 10/10

zombie chronicles isn't something to shout about, it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining b-movie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick. the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, the gore is also great and gross, the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale. zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there, if you love low budget b-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles.

okay, first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free! first - this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d. it is for the most part, but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d! what!!?!?! it's not that hard to film in a car!!! second - the story isn't very good. there are a lot of things wrong with it.third - why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film! it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed!!! watch it for a good laugh , but don't waste your time buying it. just download it or something for cheap.

i bought this while i was playing chess in hastings. i am from denmark though. it is very good. definitely with an understanding of the horror genre. the monster towards the end is very scary. people who criticise this on imdb should recall that it was a huge succes among serious horror critics.

it appears even the director doesn't like this film,but for me i think he's being a bit harsh on himself.sure it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots,and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout.it's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well.if you like horror films shot in england, give it a go.i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film 'the devil's chair' which looks quite amazing.there aren't enough english horror films for me, so any that come along deserve our attention, and this one isn't as bad as you may think

an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold.people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed.kitty (barbara bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. is it franziska (marina malfatti)? is it evelyn back from death for revenge? is it a plot to steal an inheritance? the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia, who only did one other giallo, as far as i know.the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out. someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty.

all good movies "inspire" some direct to video copycat flick. i was afraid that "gladiator" wasn't really that good a film, because i hadn't seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything roman on the new releases shelf for months. then i spotted full moon's latest offering, demonicus. i'm a fan of full moon's puppetmaster series, and blood dolls, but had never seen one of their non-killer puppet films. anyway...demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the alps. one of the campers, james, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on. he becomes possessed, and, as the demonic gladiator tyrannus, is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse, who is the real tyrannus.granted, like many full moon films, this has little or no budget. at times, the editing and direction was so amateurish i'd swear i was watching the blair witch project. the attempts at chopping off of limbs and heads reminds me of a monty python skit. the weapons, although apparently real, look really plastic-y. it literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder on a weekend. granted, there's nothing wrong with such film-making, just don't rent this expecting a technical masterpiece. it looks like there were attempts at research for the script too, because, even though tyrannus really doesn't act much like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks latin.all trashing aside, i actually enjoyed this film. not as much as a killer puppet film, perhaps, but full moon still delivers! the only thing that disappointed me was there was no full moon videozone at the end!

demonicus is a movie turned into a video game! i just love the story and the things that goes on in the film.it is a b-film ofcourse but that doesn`t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was rad! horror and sword fight freaks,buy this movie now!

demonicus rocked, you guys need to understand how hard it rocked, unfortunately, the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered. for a tiny idea, pop like 50 hits of e, watch death factory while on the phone with jesus, wait, jesus is on call waiting, you're having phone sex with will smith on the primary line. seriously, that movie... so good. you need to watch it at least a 4 times to catch all the subtleties... well, not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the movie, times 4 in order to ponder why the people at full moon are allowed to a, live, and b, reproduce. what is our world coming to?

when i was over at hollywood video i looked through their clearance out movies and there was demonicus for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off! i saw it only once before and couldn't pass up this great deal! the second viewing was much better than the first. the box is so cool and the music is very good. if you haven't seen demonicus yet i recommend that you do or if you rented and hated demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind. if you seen a copy at hollywood video for the price i got it for don't pass it up as it is a great deal!demonicus is well a very different but entertaining movie.believe it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing it!it has very low budget and actors i'm sure that nobody is familiar with. we began the the video game uh i mean film with a guy and a woman some where in italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail road/train track tunnel and she says don't go in there and what does he do?the normal stuff!he didn't listen to her! he goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named tyrannous!where did the chair come from that tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the cauldron pot come from?so every cave is complete with a caultron pot?tyrannous is wearing his armor,helmet,and has a weapon or two.he does the dumbest thing a person could do,he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of tyrannous! from there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real tyrannous.now,i said before its like a video game.its hard to explain but it just feels like it.the music even sounds like video games.the acting is really terrible.the actors say things like why is he doing this,oh he was nuts already and fine since he's nuts i'm going home!also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break!this movie has some errors but it isn't a classic like werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see demonicus!

this is simply the funniest movie i've seen in a long time. the bad acting, bad script, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter.so it's not gonna win an oscar but if you've got beer and friends round then you can't go wrong.

once upon a time in a castle...... two little girls are playing in the garden's castle. they are sisters. a blonde little girl (kitty) and a brunette one (evelyn). evelyn steals kitty's doll. kitty pursues evelyn. running through long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting on an armchair, reads the newspaper. kitty complains about evelyn, while evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. evelyn begins to say repeatedly: "i am the red lady and kitty is the black lady". suddenly evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs kitty's doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head. a fight ensues. and evelyn almost uses the dagger against kitty. the grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided.later on, their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red:"a long time ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. they were sisters and hated each other. one night, for jealousy reasons, the black lady entered the red lady's room and stabbed her seven times. one year later, the red lady left her grave. she killed six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black lady. once every hundred years, the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself."the grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend, sixteen years from now, the red queen should come again and kill seven times. but he assures them that this is just an old legend.sixteen years pass.....this is the very beginning of the film. there are many twists and surprises in the film. it's better for you to forget about logic (if you really analyse it, the story doesn't make sense) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors, the gorgeous women, the clothes, the tasteful decor, the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack.enjoy barbara bouchet, sybil danning, marina malfatti, pia giancaro, among other goddesses. there's a nude by sybil danning lying on a sofa that's something to dream about. and don't forget: the lady in red kills seven times!if you've liked "la dama rossa..." check out also "la notte che evelyn uscì dalla tomba".

this is a bad movie in the traditional sense, but taken for what it is meant to be it is quite good. very funny and well made, although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste, what with jiggling breasts as a girl suffocates and so on.

emilio miraglia's first giallo feature, the night evelyn came out of the grave, was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror - and this second film is even better! we've got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around, although miraglia doesn't lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight. miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around, and as a result it's the typical giallo labyrinth, with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes. this is a definite bonus for the film, however, as while it can get a little too confusing at times; there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie. the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. the legend revolves around a woman called 'the red queen' who, legend has it, returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people. a few years later, murders begin to occur...even though he only made two giallo's, miraglia does have his own set of tributes. it's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called 'evelyn'. he likes castles, gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood, but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film; and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle, and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes. the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off! the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave; it fits the film well. the ending is something of a turn-off, as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere, it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious. but even so, this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre!

this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.directed by emilio p. miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting "la notte che evelyn usci della tomba" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.this film is a german-italian coproduction, but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "horror house". at least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, "la dama rossa uccide sette volte" is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia's above mentioned other thriller.

what a fun movie! if you're a giallo fan, red queen kills 7 times is a real winner. to begin with, it's hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo. both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life. the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy. one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start. the killer, the red queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers i've seen in an italian movie. the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful. in fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. the convoluted plot held my interest throughout. finally, bruno nicolai's score may be the best i've heard from the composer. the main theme is so memorable i haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days.the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film's finale. first, the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. if you've seen more than a couple gialli, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings. second, the ending feels a little too rushed and, as a result, is a bit confusing. i'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me, but i'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all. a second viewing might just clear this up.

i loved this movie. when i saw it on febuary 3rd i knew i had to buy it!!! it comes out to buy on july 24th!!! it has cool deaths scenes, hot girls, great cast, good story , good acting. great slasher film. the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls. see this movies

i really enjoyed this thriller! i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. the cast was excellent, the plot was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i've ever seen! the girls in it were really cute also, especially denise richards. she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph!

i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes... this is definitely really about a 5.5..... ummm.. it was kind of bloody, had likeable, shallow characters, and it had some really hot babes in it. i like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way everytime... that sometimes gets old.

katherine heigl, marley shelton, denise richards, david boreanaz. even before i knew what this film was about, these names were enough to draw me in. gorgeous, talented and popular, these are performers to look out for.ok, where do i start. we already know what the film is about. five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher, a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago. his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose. his weapon of choice: well, take a pick - axe, knife, electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. ok, so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality.horror movies aren't supposed to be shakespeare, but i'm not gonna go there. i love horror movies, but not all of them. this one, i adore. it's up there with some of my other favorites. it's funny, sexy and scary. the killer's mask is childishly creepy, and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky. the acting is topnotch: denise richards, marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun. i really did wish to see much, much more of katherine heigl. i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon. jessica capshaw is a very capable actress, and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2. the smaller parts were also good; hedy buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her.highlights: every death scene had a particular distinction to it. the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue. the hottub scene, while ludicrous, was well done. and the audiovisual maze was sinister. the soundtrack is great, with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes.lowpoint: i felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough, we barely saw the mask, and it wasn't featured at all during the climax. i also thought the climax was really unfocused, but fun nonetheless.the twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise, but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine.i don't like to tell people which movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing, then valentine would be it.my rating: 10/10 (bullseye!)

another entry in the "holiday horror" category that fills the shelves of your local video store. the *spoiler* "wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him" plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before. and those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it. marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz, denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it. oh, and i loved the creepy mask.

the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced. apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist'). in those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.

what an awesome movie! it was very scary, great acting, well-written, nice plot twists, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non-horror fans, but is still (nonetheless) one of the best thrillers out there today! i highly recommend it to only fans of:1) the horror genreor2) an actor or actress featured in it.*** out of **** stars!ps- i am sick and tired of people comparing this, and other modern horror movies, with scream. ya know what, they didn't want to be like scream. everyone's like "oh, they copied scream!". well, if i am not mistaking, scream also copied other movies too! in fact, just about every horror movie copied an earlier one. scream, however, was a good film. but, still... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is!go and rent this one!

valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good. marley shelton did great as the female lead (much better than jennifer love hewitt in the "i know..." films). david boreanaz, whom is the main reason i saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played it well. the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards. she was horrible in this. the only scene i was glad to see her in was *spoiler* her death scene. all in all, it's a good movie to watch. you should definitely watch this before you watch "scream" or "i know..." again.

these slasher pics are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun.the valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out.the film has one peach of a line... "he's no angel...." when he in fact is angel!!! watching buffy reruns will never be the same!the cast is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters. sorry but no!the direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imaginations implied threat. much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes...:-(essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the "borrowing" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks. psycho's shower scene is tributed, along with halloween's "masking". murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know!!!light viewing, not very scary but a few good jump moments. if it was a choice between the hole and this though, choose the hole. slasher movies have had their day, and this is just another slasher. a very good slasher, but nothing groundbreaking!!!

call me stupid, but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie, valentine. it was so well-made, well-written, well-acted, well-directed, etc! everything about it was wonderful! there were parts that were relatively routine (lily's death), very funny (www.bleed-me-dry.com), completely horrifying and creepy (paige's death), and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene). i think the entire cast did a great job, especially the three leads: david boreanaz, denise richards (both of whom i met, and got autographs from, during the filming of this movie - very nice people!), and marley shelton.i am very sick of people calling this movie "another scream clone". this movie is, in no way, a scream clone. in fact, this film runs rings around scream. it actually makes sense! scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it. excuse me, but it looks like scream was also a clone too (ahem..., friday the 13th, halloween, and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). i also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. it's so strange to see a sweet, cupid face doing all of these horrible things. another novelty (the nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! the ending gives me chills every time i see it!!!!! so, even if you didn't like it the first time, watch valentine again and give it another chance!ps- keep an eye out for my new website (www.love-hurts.org)! coming soon...

when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine, i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment, but surprise, surprise, i loved it. convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles, let alone take in the ridiculous explanation. these quibbles apart, however, the film is a dream. fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score. he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so. really enjoyable with lots of colour, plenty of sexiness, some gory kills and minimal police interference. super.

i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever. when i watched valentine, i was amazed at how great the story line actually was. it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor, and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring, but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful. it had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets. i recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on valentine's day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills. oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer or rating, please, don't...

it's a colorful slasher movie. that's about it.it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies, but i never care for such things. figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway.the death scenes were inventive and gorey, bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th. another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl, unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious. people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie. as simple as that. i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same. --mb

i just saw "valentine" and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years. unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking. for those out there that hated "scream," there is not one reference to "the horror rules" in this movie (even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here). this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror. you get the style, cinematography, and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick. i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for. this is definitely a move in the right direction.denise richards stands out here as a fun character. you can tell she liked her role, and that makes her stand out. i loved her in this movie.

i'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. i classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial. valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks, after his urban legends. unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes valentine the best. as the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth. since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of him. when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come to see this point of view of humanism: "noone is entirely good or evil. in fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted." just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. the second iconic element is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date, never able to met with. katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables. denise richards is killed third, while she just found a valentines' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer. marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know, 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed. finally, benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer, david boreanaz.the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the valentines' day celebration at dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes. everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know. hard rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie.

a group of model-caliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine's day cards. who is the killer and why is the killer after them? my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. however, i can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine. the first time i watched it, upon its theatrical release, i thought it was pretty awful--i gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an "f" letter grade. watching it for a second time last night, i can't remember what the heck i didn't like about it. i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe i just didn't get it. in any event, i loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an "a".it might sound ridiculous saying i didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. valentine is almost a comedy/horror. director jamie blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's urban legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). on top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the valentine's day theme.many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. however, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. it's as if blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. that's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine's day. it's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for valentine's extravagant lampooning. scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was "self-aware". valentine's day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. lest some think i'm "reading too much" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he "didn't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend" and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something "more adult".other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine's day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by tom savage. the novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. sellers has said, "while it was a fine book, i didn't think it was the right story for a film". so instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on valentine's day. while those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. it's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.blanks' direction is impeccable visually. valentine's day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. he also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. david boreanaz, as adam carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments.while valentine's day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. if you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more.

i, like many horror fans, have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years. here, at last, is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes.you want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood, lots of it, by the bucket load - you got it.with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham, this really is fantastic stuff.despite it's low budget, by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix, director james eaves has created something that feels much bigger.a must for old school horror fans.

turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. the variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! i enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. i also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts, hellbreeder and sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. they have a great website which is worth checking out. can't wait for bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.

the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast, and excellent direction by james eves. the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast. james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action, fall and then rise to a climax. he does this with an element of humour, plenty of twists, thrills and blood. this is a return of the old vampire movie, with loads of gore, blood and screams. the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure,but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action.great !

so, finally i know it exists. along with the other uk contributors on here i saw this on what must have been it's only uk screening in the 70's. i remembered the title, but got nowhere when i mentioned it to people. it scarred me (that's 2 'r's) but when you go to bed with doom whizzing about your brain and listening all around for impending terror, then isn't that what a truly classic horror movie is all about?? i can barely remember the intricacies of the movie, but what i do recollect is my shivering flesh and heightened senses. can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? again, if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this, please get in touch...

like many people on this site, i saw this movie only once, when it was first televised in 1971. certain scenes linger in my memory and an overall feeling of disquiet is how i remember being affected by it. i would be fascinated to see it again, if it was ever made available for home video.possible spoiler: i wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a 1960 british movie, originally titled city of the dead, retitled horror hotel for the american release? there are some similarities also to a later british film the wicker man.one detail remains with me years after seeing the film. it's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. as i recall, a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road, circa 1870, somewhere out west. the friendly seeming ray milland introduces himself and his ( daughter?), yvette mimieux, a beautiful young mute woman. while the preacher is helping ray milland with the wagon, a rattlesnake slithers into view and coils menacingly, unobserved by any of the characters except yvette mimieux. she doesn't look scared at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration, until it goes away. with this strange little moment, we already realize there's something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks, though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time.that one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years, along with many others. the film has a haunting quality about it that won't let go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly. someone ought to make this available for home video!

finally got to see this classic tv movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old vhs, it is a classic piece of horror. its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on dvd and vhs ... the tv horror movie. recommended for all fans of the 70's tv movie much like trilogy of terror. those interested should get the book on the subject by david deal - television fright films of the 70's. email me for a chance to see it.....its fabulous to see it again.it does have it problems like many tv movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today.

i have seen this film only once, on tv, and it has not been repeated. this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again. usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement, but this one really scared me.do not read the next bit if you have'nt seen the film yetthe scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead (they'd been poisoning her). he asks who the hell are you people anyway. one by one they give their true identities. the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says "i am lilith, the witch who loved adam before eve".

i feel like i have some uber-rare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net! i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an "experts" site on the web. i too, saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending. i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since. no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding it's title. alas, even knowing the name, i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially. small steps...g

i saw this movie on tv when it came out, and never seen it again. for the life of me, i couldn't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy thinne's movie credits. excellent, dark, and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as "crowhaven farm"; "don't be afraid of the dark"; and "satan's school for girls", all lost satanic classics. i also think it has many parallels to clint eastwood's classic, "high plains drifter". why don't they release these great little movies, especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount dvd racks at wal-mart? most of these flicks have a cult-following, so sales shouldn't be a problem.

whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i've ever seen, i invariably reply "black noon" and to this day nobody's ever heard of it.i watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening. as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhs.if anyone can trace a copy please let me know.if i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film!

i cannot believe how unknown this movie is,it was absolutely incredible. the ending alone has stuck with me for almost thirty years. the road sign through the rearveiw mirror blew me away. if you liked "race with the devil" you will love this movie

most complaints i've heard of this film really come down to one thing: it isn't versus. yes, the cast and crew is basically the same. yes, kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film's second half, but that's about where the similarities end. versus takes place essentially all outside, showcasing kitamura's ability to craft an interesting b-movie in natural locations. for alive, almost everything takes place inside. in small, cramped spaces. here the art design is thrust into your face, and what art design it is! we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces. also a key difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the film. versus was all about action and cool, here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind. because of this, alive is a far more interesting film than versus. you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed, but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters.i'm now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay. you should too! but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus - it's often slow, and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it. i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release!

an inventive, suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia. a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms. not completely successful, but taut, surprising and well-acted. one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw  two men trapped in room and pitting against each other  but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film. it's like watching a lab experiment. some might find the contained suspense tedious, but this reviewer found it enthralling. the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized. this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system. just right for a late night movie fest, when one is in the paranoid mood. it certainly kept me awake that night.

tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. when he survives electrocution the government officials give him a choice to either be electrocute at a greater degree or agree to some experiments. he chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell with a bad ass criminal who also survived the electrocution. they can have whatever the want in the room (within reason), but they can't leave. after a few days there meals are cut down to one per day and the room temp is set up too 100. after some more alarms are sounded at intervals so they can't sleep. one day a 'witch' come into their cell (albeit a glassed off portion) what happens next i'll let you find out. i may be in the minority here but i liked the build up, it was intriguing to me. now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was i would have rated this so much higher.my grade: c+ media blaster's 2 dvd set extras: disc 1) director's cut; trailers for "versus", "aragami", "attack the gas station", and "deadly outlaw rekka" disc 2) theatrical cut; commentary with hideo sakaki, ryuhei kitamura, sakaguchi takuand tsutomu takahashi; cast and crew interview; making of; original trailer; and promo teasers

the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells, waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair. then our "hero", who is called tenshu, is taken to the chair, he's zapped, and then....he's still "alive". aha ! he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you". our hero says yes to option 2, and then the actual story commences. he wakes up in a different sort of cell (very high-tech and very big), where he finds another cell-mate, who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride. a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish, as long as it happens within that room. sounds a little suspicious, but the two men accept : what else can they do ? what these two men do not know is that they have been set together, so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them. basically the unknown scientists in the background p**s them off until they decide that they should kill each other. sounds weird ? indeed, but there's a greater purpose to all of this. this is the part which should not be revealed, and so it shall remain unrevealed. but fear not, it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-action movie, fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : how long time can you stand being with a man who's an s.o.b. and would you kill him to obtain freedom ? the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it sneaks up without you actually knowing it. then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix-like action fight-scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon. the movie is indeed very special, so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances. however, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic, and the actors do their bit (some more than others) to make the movie truly unique. if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it, watch it, and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash.

alivealive is a very entertaining sci-fi movie from japan. i have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved versus this director's debut film or his third film azumi. i have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies. frankly i went to the video store to get versus but i am just fine with alive.if you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then alive is not your pick. there is plenty of action however it comes as pay-off for a whole hour of character driven build-up. personally i think it is well done and worth it.of course some of the plot is silly as with many sci-fi action films and i think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect. this film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply.they kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground building(taking a cue from the cube) but the film doesn't suffer for it. another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many flashbacks and dream sequences. rent this!

i found this movie to be very well-paced. the premise is quite imaginative, and as a viewer i was pulled along as the characters developed. the pacing is done very well for those that like to think--enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on, and questions keep arising which are later answered, producing a well-thought out and very satisfying film, both cerebrally and from an action standpoint.it seems some people were looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with this film--one of those that comes charging out of the gate. this would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill--creating a wonderful sense of anticipation--and is ultimately, in my mind, more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid.excellent film.

i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. i saw it at an independent film festival, so don't expect it to come to your town anytime soon. during the film, i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out. too bad for them (down here in the south, folks don't like having to read subtitles). the movie starts out slow, but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored. when the action finally arrives, i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster.i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters, especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen. it reminded me of zelda (ocarina of time) when you face level bosses.if this is the future of "video game/comic book" movies, then i welcome it.

this is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used. almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated x, and so seen as a pornographic movie. here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females "own satisfaction" need.a very good film!

i guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of "beauty and the beast", but i can't say i've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex. wow. anyway it seems that a young woman and her..aunt? have traveled to this castle in france where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner, who is the man who takes care of making sure the horses get their rocks off. it seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather, uh, frisky, i guess you could say, with the ladies, or at least, one in particular. there are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon-to-be-blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom's father removes it from her sight. anyway, the young bride-to-be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a cardinal to show up to the wedding (a family member, i guess) and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her. the effects in this leave a little to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not that i know much about that) is kind of rendered laughable, especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat. this has a rather strange and abrupt, yet twist ending, with not really any clues or much build up to it, but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what i expected. i don't know, this is kind of a tough one to get through but it has its moments and is definitely weird. 7 out of 10.

if you were born around the time this movie was finished, and had a liberal/open minded household that i had, i'm sure during the early 80's you'd be first introduced to walking in on your parents watching dirty movies or extreme dirty movies. you know, not 100% pornographic but rather an alchemical mixture of actual drama and pornography, or that you'd sneak into their collection and pop in the plastic rectangle representation of such a film in a big dookie machine called a vhs. you had to be very quiet and ninja like but still having minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made when pressing the tablet-like buttons out of fear of being discovered. whatever the case, such films were sent into the back of your mind, waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual "art". needless to say, this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a "t". many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being desensitized, i am more disturbed by the subtleties. was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be considered a true abomination, interracial relations, bed frame masturbation, voyeurism, or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder, pedophilia/homosexuality, or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist females in 18th century france? who can say, but despite mr. borowcyzk's taste for vivid, raw sexuality being the "norm" for his works, i'd say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning bestial carnality. once i have learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value and there fore, it is well worth checking out.

wow. uhm...well...wow! i guess i'll start with the plot. a betrothed woman (lucy) arrives at the family home of her would be husband (mathurin) in france, where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the catholic church to marry them (to satisfy a will.) while waiting, young lucy learns about a legend of a beast who roamed the grounds centuries before. in bed that night, she begins fantasizing about the beast and his rape-turned-consensual tryst with the former lady of the house. that's where it gets interesting! the plot is really pretty thin (and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick), but the filmmaker rewards (?) those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale.this movie isn't for everyone. if you're looking for great cinema, look elsewhere. if you're looking for a far-out movie about bestiality (that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject) this movie is for you! (if you have a weak stomach, don't be afraid of this one. outside of some horse-on-horse action at the beginning, the 'deeds' are pretty cartoonish, imo)

i must say, i thought i had seen it all. i am an extremely jaded movie buff. this movie didn't shock me, by any means. i'm way past that point. but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn't know i could go to. i had no idea i could ever find (ick) the idea of beastiality erotic. never never never. ever. ever. but there you go. he did it. i have to give the director credit. he pulled it off.for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore. we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex. after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn't a mistake. then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married. then some nervous guy shaves. then we see (briefly) a hot chick getting it on with a butler (but this is very brief). at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake. in fact, i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night.we finally get the good stuff when a girl (who knows who she is, or who anyone is in this movie) has a dream about a victorian-era gal being ravaged by a beast-thing in the forest. the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole deal. it's beautifully shot, superbly edited, and does deliver the goods. they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn't either. oh well. i would definitely recommend this film. the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my tv) but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it.

this one is out there. not much to say about it except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in films of beastiality. i can see why this film was banned for so long, the topics dealt within the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits in with the mood of the film. it's a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose ...to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we don't see to often in films. i came across this film on the net that i thought i might check out. i enjoyed the film as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time. something you don't rarely see in films today.

strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over. appears to be an interesting take on "beauty and the beast". it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era.corsets, castles, rutting horses, rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods, proof that no-one had a brazilian in the 70's, and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at, what more could you possibly want?!it certainly brightened my sunday afternoon!

this movie is simply incredible! i had expected something quite different form the film that i actually saw. however, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior. let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual, for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography. it even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape.meanwhile, i strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sexual art". every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies, by the way. one should not forget how times have changed!go see it! it´s worth your money and time!

i saw this film in a london cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since. i found it hilarious. i loved it's originality. it's rare that someone makes a movie like this - and it's sad too.what i mean is, i once read a book called "the black hotel" - and as a film-fan, i always "picture" books as films. kinda "adapt" them, you know? but as i read it, i thought, well, this would make a great movie - but of course it would have to be "adapted" - to the point where it would bear little relationship to the book.but then i thought, well why? sure, it could never be shown on sunday afternoon tv, but provided it were shown in cinemas to adults, who knew what it contained, where's the harm? dammit, my civil liberties were being crushed here. a director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of "the black hotel".in an ideal world, censorship of films for adults should not exist. but sadly, whilst i accept that with intelligent adults, such freedom might be harmless, there would always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality, and who might be spurred on to commit foul deeds.however, it's hard to see how "la bete" falls into that category.on it's appearance in england, the british censor dismissed it out of hand. despite the '69 relaxation on nudity, given the film's theoretical theme of bestiality, had the censor passed any of it, he'd have been looking for a new job on monday.but... in those days, there was an alternative. the g.l.c. this was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london, where it was deemed audiences were more "sopisticated" than those who lived out in the sticks.the film was duly submitted and passed. however, it later emerged that the "board" consisted of just four people - three who voted, plus a "chairman". and on the day, one of the voters was off sick. thus the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to view "la bete".one of said voters thought, like me, that the film was hilarious and hardly likely to encourage foul deeds by anyone. the other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting. and the chairman didn't understand it, so decided to err on the side of freedom.when the missing voter finally saw the film, they too thought it disgusting, but it was too late! the film had received its "x-london" certificate and opened to mixed reaction. the g.l.c. film censorship board was disbanded soon after! thus "la bete" only opened in london by what could best be termed a fluke! but i'm glad it was. it's great! if you haven't seen it, do so. it's a fantasy, and as such, it's far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days...

good movie, very 70s, you can not expect much from a film like this,, sirpa lane is an actress of erotic films, a nice body but nothing exceptional savant to a pornographic actress from the body disappears, but the '70s were characterized a small breasts and a simple eroticism. not demand a lot from these films are light years away from the movies today, the world has changed incredibly. the plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary. and the brunette actress has a single body, has one breast slightly bigger. be satisfied. papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm ... download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them.

regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem "la bête" of 1975, one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience. borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time, and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors. "la bête" is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy-tale-like atmosphere, quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise. the fact that beastiality (of sorts) is one of the film's central themes did certainly not help it with the censors, but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience.pierre de l'esperance (guy tréjan), the head of a french aristocratic family, has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin (pierre benedetti) to marry lucy broadhurst (lisbeth hummel), the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family. due to an old curse, mathurin's uncle (marcel dalió) is strictly against the wedding. when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate, lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor romilda (sirpa lane), and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings. the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever-dream... without giving away too much, i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film. as bizarre as it is, "la bête" is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style, settings and cinematography. the fever-dream-like atmosphere is present within- and out of dream-sequences. the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings, and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale. the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic (elegant female nudity, ravishing actresses) to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting (close-ups on horses' genitalia while having intercourse,...); in either case it is not likely to be forgotten. the entire cast of "la bête" is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters (some of which are seriously demented). the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast, be it lisbeth hummel in the lead, finnish actress sirpa lane (who sadly died of aids in 1999) as the ancestor in the dream-sequences, or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault, who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard.i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed. some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film, the scenes with the eponymous 'beast' definitely being among them. certainly not everybody's cup of tea, but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema. a true cult gem!

for anyone who has only seen disney productions beautifully animated version of 'beauty & the beast', or even jean cocteau's surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 french (but with a director from poland) version. the plot concerns a french family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do english family. the major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family. the film also includes many flashback sequences (potentially) explaining this family curse. from the opening credits, to the very end, it's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride, with some very explicit & graphic sexual content (hence the film's x rating in the u.s. in it's initial run,which is now unrated). the film's somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of bunuel's flights into similar territory. if you have a taste for the truly bizarre, and are not offended by "taboo" material, then this film may just scratch that itch for you.

now my friends, films like "la bête" (aka "the beast" or "o monstro")only can be done in the old continent :),in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... in the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,walerian borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. its a astonishing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. for all fans of european shocking exploitation, i recommend this film.if you like this one i recommend: "orloff against the invisible man" and "alterated states".

perhaps it's me and my perverted ways, or the fact that i tend to have a very sick mind, but i rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise, i enjoyed it. yes, i read the synopsis on the back of the dvd box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured i was prepared for anything it would offer. i was clearly deceived after seeing...well...everything, to cut a long story short. i can see why it was banned, not only for such explicit sex scenes, but for beastiality. of course, as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the beast, a personal favorite of mine, it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever-the-hell-that-thing-was-like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation. of course, the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods. but that's not all. oh, there is so much more! not only do we get to see interspecial sex, but there's also humping horses, the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she's not humping the bed to get her...er...satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals. creative and enjoyable, but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after i went to bed...i was 15. words of advice when watching this film: make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed. it may be fun, but i doubt there are other porn films like this one.

youth, sexuality, and the french countryside -- one of the more unique films you're ever going to see. if you can see it that is, no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) it's sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting, and occasionally funny. a trifle boring also in the middle, but all in all you can't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you've seen this one at least once.

polish film maker walerian borowczyk's la bête (french, 1975, aka the beast) is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too. this film tells everything that's generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images. the images may look wild, perverse, "sick" or exciting, but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned. sex, desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it. they interest and temptate us so powerfully (and by our nature) that they are considered scary, unacceptable and something too wild to be true. a sophisticated young woman travels with her mother to a french countryside to meet her soon-to-become husband whom with she has had a letter affair of some kind. all are very exciting and each others' parents and relatives wait impatiently to see the new people arriving to their families. the innocence of the young bride shines through and no one knows what can happen and wake up inside the walls of the big and beautiful french mansion, with all its humans and animals, and a mysterious "la bête" that turns out to be something that the characters, nor most of the film's audience, could have never imagined to be real and (in front of) them.the film is about the same theme as canadian david cronenberg's debyt feature shivers (1975), which happens inside a huge luxury building in which destructive and gory parasites spread from human to human by sexual contact and make people act furiously and violently in their lust for pleasure and fulfilment of instincts. human has instincts that can be and are stronger than his will and that is why those instincts can be as dangerous and powerful as the instincts of some other animal, a beast, be it a lust for blood, revenge or sex and carnal pleasure. humans are only animals that have intelligence and tools to convey it but because we are also animals, that intelligence is not always used too much as can be seen anywhere around us. the film opens greatly, and very shockingly for most hypocritic attitudes, showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the mare and continue the race, but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there, not the close-ups of organs as could be so easily claimed. the horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat, in heat that's much stronger than his will as he doesn't have any control at that point anymore. the power of the instinct makes an animal a beast.after the memorable beginning, the characters get introduced, and the film fantastically has all the necessary age groups inside it from the little innocent children waiting to grow up and develop to their blossom, to the adults and elders that all represent their own part of the lifespan, creating the face of human life on screen. a film doesn't necessarily need more characters this way as all the important ones are already there and represent the whole race, including the urban and countryside inhabitants, and both sexes. the mansion makes the protagonist girl's sexuality wake as she saws the horses coupling and acting like she obviously has never thought of. for the first time she sees something unique and something that excites and feels almost vital for her and her body, like getting water when you're very thirsty. the transformation of the girl is a very important element in the film as she has lived unaware of these things inside her, with his mother and camera and a letter-boyfriend, even though the things have just waited for the moment to burst out. flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a humanimal, but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades? man's stupidity and unwillingness to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise violated.the film's last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning, and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk. as the girl and audience realizes what her body starts to feel and desire, she starts to have dreams about the mysterious beast that turns out to be none other than the undressed form of ourselves, having lived in the woods without other people/beasts near him. the dream sequence is the one that causes and caused most of the controversy alongside the film's overall straight and honest attitude, and the images are so easy to be judged as "perverse" and "pornographic", without a courage to go deeper into them, character reactions and thoughts behind what we see. the images are exciting in her dream and also eventually inside the dream for the dream's (more) human character, and borowczyk forces us to admit it with the images that are so close to a "normal" sexual act between a man and a female, which is a beautiful thing and expression of love, another human need. also the numerous, and cleverly blackly humorous love making scenes inside the mansion, between the young mother and the black servant, get interrupted many times as someone screams for the servant, for example, and there's no doubt that the sensual image of two young human bodies being together and being interrupted with an angry shout at least doesn't become any more pleasant by the interruption. borowczyk has managed to paint his images so beautiful and "sensitive" that his message is almost impossible to be misunderstood, but nothing seems to be impossible for our cultures and minds that criticize art. he uses dialogue only when it's necessary, otherwise the images do the job and make the film powerful.death is also there, as flesh dies sooner or later, after years of life and instincts, it dies. the ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and "revealing" ending too. another blackly humorous element comes when we see the shocked city women running out of the place in which they saw a little more than they were looking for! they visited the mansion of truth about flesh, us and them. the film reminds me of french writer georges bataille's story of the eye with its same themes about eroticism, death and how they both are always connected to the nature of our flesh. the book is well written and fantastic as well as this film, and naturally both have been blamed for their "too explicit" content and other equally noteworthy shallow comments.borowczyk's film is also very beautiful visually alongside its raw honesty, and the nature and forest have rarely looked so bright and shining as they do in this film. the sun shines through the trees, and to everyplace where humans live, and the beauty of it is always there, but so is the ugliness that originates by the inhabitants of the world. to every innocent white sheep there's a selfish, evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep, present inside every human soul. it is about how many manages to keep the dark side passive and not active. the fulfilment of some of our instincts is not a bad thing, and by using this intelligence and seeing which of the instincts are good and which bad, they can be satisfied without exploitation, violence and the lethal and destructive circle created by it. human is not more than an animal with intelligence, intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment. borowczyk's film is a masterpiece, unforgettable and clever piece of magical cinema with ageless theme and also an example of how much can be achieved, expressed and given by a film maker, who is also only a human.

ok...this one's a weirdy....honestly, i can't tell you all the inner plot-points of the beast, cuz i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes - but just wait, it definitely does "pick up"...the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day. eventually you see "the beast", which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat-bear costume with a horse cock attached to it. the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep. the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared. the beast pops up, rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her. eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast's "attention" which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes, including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere (yeah, i've got a twisted foot-fetish - so sue me....)...the whole film is told in flashbacks and long-winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious. a "shocking" but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film...the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate. the cinematography itself is quite eye-catching and the sets, costumes and locations are elaborate. the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat-bear. a good bit of tits, ass, and hairy 70's french bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film. i have to honestly say, that if it weren't for the graphic scenes of the beast spackling all over the willing maiden, this film would have been a real bore - that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex (the beginning has a very up-close and personal scene of two horses boning, including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina...yum!!!). but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film, that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer. i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they've seen it all - the beast rape really is out-there and something to be witnessed. also recommended to any fans of 70's/80's sleaze films - this one ranks pretty high with them. worth a look for you sick rat-bear beastiality lovers out there (like me)...8/10

"la bête" by walerian borowczyk is based on the short story "lokis" written by prosper merimée.lucy broadhurst(lisabeth hummel),an american heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished marquis,arrives at the family's crumbling château and learns of a mythical ursine beast purported to prowl the nearby forest.it is fabled that a former lady of the house(sirpa lane)once engaged in perverse sex with the creature and lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident. "the beast" is an art-house mix of surreal horror,explicit sleaze and porno.there's implied bestiality,assault and perversion in the priesthood,copious fake ejaculate smeared on bared breasts,masturbation with a rose and, most graphic of all,the eponymous beast toying with incredibly big phallus.still this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless.the women here are stunningly beautiful and they are naked most of the time.overall "la bête" is a visual feast.whether it be from the fetishistic attention to detail,or the visual motifs pregnant with information,borowczyk's masterpiece should be watched with care and attention.a must-see for fans of european cult cinema.

if, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast. the film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women. the film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, i might add; but the film conveys it; straight and to the point. like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, the beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience, in some ways, for the incredible, tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see. the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining point. as said during the film; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence. both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire, and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast. the film has strong themes of the age-old story of 'beauty and beast' weaved into it, and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust, but not without a moral.many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. besides that, borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.overall, the beast is a shocking film. it's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. however, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace the beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance.

no, this hilariously horrible 70's made-for-tv horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so-execrable-it's-downright-awesome sort of way. richard crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and yvette mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in "jackson county jail," sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit. pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the disney "witch mountain" pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den. boy, now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing? well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't, but it sure is funny, thanks to curtis ("night tide") harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both martine beswicke and r.g. armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman). favorite scene: the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. while stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo.

before cujo,there was lucky the devil dog. in 1978,on halloween night the movie"devil dog,the hound of hell" premiered. a story of a family getting a new puppy (from a farmer who just happen to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables) because their dog skipper was killed.coencidence? everyone loves the new dog,but there is something strange about him. it isn't long until the father mike barry(richard crenna,first blood)starts to notice.his wife betty(yvette mimieux,where the boys are,jackson county jail,snowbeast)is different and his kids charlie and bonnie(ike eisenman,witch mountain and fantastic vourage and kim richards,witch mountain,nanny and the professor,hello larry,tuff-turf)also have changed. does the dog have something to do with it? he's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family.this movie is great because it has ike and kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies. this is one of the many 70's made-for-tv horror movies that was actually scary for a made-for-tv horror movie. the music was creepy and even the ending which i won't tell made you think.this movie also stars ken kercheval(cliff barnes of dallas)and r.g. armstrong(who couldn't stay away from devil movies remember"race with the devil"?)it's worth watching.

the devil dog: hound of hell is really good film. it has good acting by the cast including richard crenna and r.g. armstrong.the music is spooky and gives that devilish chill!i liked the effects on the dog and i think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns,frill like part on his neck, and acted really viscous!if you like horror films and haven't seen the devil dog: hound of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i don't think you'll be disappointed!

not only does this film have one of the great movie titles, it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors ike eissenman and kim richards. i seem to remember this film being broadcast halloween week back in '78 going against linda blair in stranger in our house. i missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film. later, on repeat, i saw i made the right choice. the movie is not really bad, but, really lacks any chills or surprises. although, i did like the scene where richard crenna shoots the family dog to no avail.

yes it was a little low budget, but this movie shows love! the only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to "waterworld" and though the plot was good, the film never really tapped into it's full potential! strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night.

i've seen this movie more than once. it was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then. the only problem i had was with the title for the obvious reasons... one immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by drake's! leaving off the first part, 'hound of hell' would have sufficed.richard crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. but this was an enjoyable halloween fare offered by the cbs network. i loved the part where crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast. he asks the cab driver how to find this guy. great dialogue between the native cab driver and crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people's ethnic beliefs. 'aw, mr. barry, i left that stuff behind when i came down from the mountains...' - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and nobody knows how to really contact him. as far as supernatural fare goes, this movie is still enjoyable.

i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon. though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention, and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end. i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film (oops, didn't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior), and was very pleased to be able to watch it again (and in its entirety).i don't wholly understand the phenomenon, but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary. the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons, but are they actually scary? no, not very. likewise in the years since the 70s we've gotten horror movies that are cooler, more exciting, have much better production values and sophisticated special effects, are more fun, funnier, have effective "jump" moments, and some very creative uses of gore, but again... they aren't really scary! there's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films. the grainy film quality. the spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs. the "edge of dreamland" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently eq'd scores. the odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything. everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s, in the case of horror, works in its favor.specifically, in this film, the quiet, intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving. so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling, slavering, and overtly hostile ("cujo"?). the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form. the effects when that occurs, while unsophisticated by today's standards, literally gave me chills. the bizarre, vaguely-defined, "i'm not quite sure what i'm looking at" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be, rather than the hyper-real, crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films.while the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit, the actors all do a decent job. the pairing of the brother and sister from the "witch mountain" movies as, yes, brother and sister, is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting, but they do fine. yvette mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular. richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses. his self-doubt as he wonders whether his family's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled, though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he's been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté.the movie's the-end-question-mark type ending is one of the only ones i've seen that doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick, and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they'd be likely to do and how they'd feel about it.detractors of this film may say it's merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots, but hey, you could say the same thing about "blade runner". :-)

this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy editing, little to no continuity, insane dialog, bad (you might even say non-existent) acting, pointless story lines, shots that go on far too long...and it's perfect for mst3k-style riffing, not to mention the "corpse eaters drinking game": scribble on forms...take a shot - sign your name...take a shot - catch a bad foley edit...take many, many shots.the only reason i didn't rate it higher than 8 is because there's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness, it's only an hour long - hell, a movie like this should have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!

i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it's the finest horror film made for $36,000 i've ever seen (sorry steckler) the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan. this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere. some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film. very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims. brrrrrrr.hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head. this film entertained from start to finish. i couldn't ask for more than that. my only complaint is that is was too short.

okay, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but i've voted for "10" to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo's who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews. each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers... three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big-time hollywood productions. performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive, with notable turns by bill paxton, james karen, vivian schilling and brion james. martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe-lamp, and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim. but overall, it's got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments. definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!

one woman, by herself in a house for 45-minutes of screen time, doesn't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat... but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come! writer / star vivian schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress, and enlarges them to terrifying proportions, so don't watch this film alone!

best-selling horror novelist cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely virginia bryant), her husband tom (the likable paolo serra), and their son bobby (nicely played by patrizio vinci) go to a remote castle located in the countryside for summer vacation. local legend claims that the area is cursed. cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, nasty ogre (hulking david flosi in a strikingly hideous costume) living in the basement. cheryl has to surmount her deep-seated childhood fear of the beast so she can defeat the foul find. director/co-writer lamberto bava does an expert job of creating and sustaining an eerie and unnerving nightmarish mood. moreover, bava eschews the standard blood'n'guts fright flick routine in favor of crafting a compelling and provocative dark adult fairytale-like fable on how the best way to overcome that which frightens us is to face said source head on. sturdy supporting turns by sabrina ferilli as friendly school teacher anna, stefania montorsi as hottie babysitter maria, and alex serra as batty painter dario. gianfranco transunto's glossy cinematography boasts a few fluid tracking shots and plenty of great atmospheric lighting. fabrizio sforza's gnarly make-up f/x, simon boswell's splendidly spirited spooky'n'shuddery score, and the dank, dark, cobweb-covered cellar set all hit the skin-crawling spot. well worth watching.

the ogre doesn't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988, and i guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle 'demons 3' in order to help it sell better. well, the film is directed by lamberto bava; the man behind the first two demons films, and ogres and demons are somewhat alike (in that they're both 'monsters' anyway)...but other than that, this film has no connections to the other two films. it is, however, rather good! italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films, and while it's not completely obvious; it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from hellraiser. the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy. she is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an ogre living in her basement. it's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return...and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there's a murderous ogre living in the basement.the film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for italian tv, so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant; but for what it is, this is certainly a very decent horror film. lamberto bava may not have as keen an eye as his father mario did; but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well. the central setting, a large castle, makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and lamberto makes the best of it; even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times; such as the inferno-style pool scene. the plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange (particularly between the husband and wife). there's not a great deal of bloodshed, but bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects. the ogre itself looks really silly and it's a good job that we don't get to see it very often. we do boil down to a fitting, if highly predictable, ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended.

alright, before we review, i have to ask: why isn't this listed individually? it may have been merely a tv item in italy, but to international lamberto bava fans this is its own film. in america this film is distributed on vhs and dvd as either "the ogre" or "demons 3". yes, i know it has nothing to do with "demons" apart from one cast member and the crew. but yes, i personally was upset that this was so hard to find on this site which is otherwise so useful.finally, let's review "the ogre". i've seen the trailer for this many times on youtube and honestly found that rather scary. the movie itself (it is feature length, therefore making it a movie) has many many strong parts and does manage to scare. i was displeased by the last act, but on the whole i don't regret having bought the dvd before seeing it (available from shriek show). i guess the film's tv origins explain the last act. i won't give out any spoilers.the plot is somewhat familiar: an american horror writer vacationing at an ancient spooky castle with husband and son only to find it exactly resembles the setting of her childhood nightmares. there are faint echoes of "the shining", but this is a different brand of supernatural horror. the woman (virginia bryant) finds more and more proof that this is the real life place of her nightmares, but her husband won't believe her. great atmosphere and terror follow.the multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky. the ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a bit of uncle frank's resurrection from the first "hellraiser". there's also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene. i give them props that the film never stooped to imitating american films with similar concepts, namely "a nightmare on elm street". "the ogre" is an original. and the monster itself was a scary one, when it was presented correctly.on the shriek show dvd there is a lamberto bava interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic "demons" series. he also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the movie was filmed. indeed, this setting contributes a lot to the film. the simon boswell music helps too.there's lots of good stuff here. "the ogre" is not perfect, but it is very much worth seeing. take it is a lesser lamberto bava achievement.

the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasn't intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd, but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series. the music in demons and demons 2 was 80's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii: the ogre is a architectural horror so that's how demons iii isn't a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film.the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in, the ogre is another thing why i like the film. there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons (demoni 3) and the church (demons 3). demons iii: the ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with demons and demons 2.

to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet, i have a friendly warning: don't watch "la casa dell'orco" expecting any demons at all, because you won't find them here. this film is not a third installment to the "demons" series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever, except the fact that lamberto bava directed them. as a matter of fact, michele soavi's "the church" is also known an unofficial "demons 3" and it's a deceptive title in that case as well, so go figure. it is obvious that due to the "demons" films success; they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles, even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story. having said that, i think it's unfair on the other hand, to say that "la casa dell'orco" is not worth the look. honestly, the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations, i thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole. nevertheless, i think it's fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate lucio fulci's "the house by the cemetery". of course, that's just a speculation i have, but i think i have my valid evidences. for instance, in both films, paolo marco is the man of the family, in both films, there's an irritating little son named bobby, in both films, the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty-something, who seems to be the only one to see that there's something really wrong in the new house, and in both films, there's something really, really wrong going on in the basement. i'm sorry but i can relate both films very easily and i'm not saying that as an accusation. for the contrary, my point is that those who enjoyed "the house by the cemetery" are probably going to enjoy this movie as well, keeping in mind of course, that "la casa dell'orco" is far less pretentious, less scary, not nearly as atmospheric, but the formula is still there.in "la casa dell'orco", charel, her husband tom and their little son, bobby, go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle, situated in the heart of an italian villa called trifiri. leaving aside the beauty of the place, shortly after their arrival, charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before, which is impossible, considering that she had never been to trifiri before. sadly, charel can't get over her déjà vu and the worst part is that her visions, come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her. tom, who is not a very patient guy to begin with, advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation. however, the woman's visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy, suddenly turn into a living nightmare. the old nightmare from charel's childhood becomes real and this time, she won't be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first.as it is expected, the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence, it is hard to fill an hour and a half. this means that "la casa dell'orco" offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character, walking around the castle for several minutes, reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else. it gets rather tedious from time to time, but overall, it's nothing serious. like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties, this movie is pretty stylish and effective, but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments, that make the movie unforgettable in a way. for instance, the part in which charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like i would have expected, she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac. the funniest thing however, is the fact that two minutes later, they're a happy couple again, as if punching each other like that, was the most natural thing in the world. i know it's silly, but i myself, found it absolutely hilarious. the ogre (which is obviously the villain of the story) looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let's face it: a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit, it's twice as welcomed. it reminded me of michael jackson in "thriller", but much more natural and human, of course. but if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that i mentioned before: the music composed by simon boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same, it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension. so if i have to give my final statement regarding this movie, i'm going to have to say that i can't help loving it, including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical italian horror movies from the late eighties, won't be disappointed by this one. it has all the typical and always well received clichés, like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth, the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch, a creepy castle, a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility, to stay away from the infamous lands. i would say that "la casa dell'orco" deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse's face, as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story. take this movie for what it is and enjoy it.

most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two demons films. and with the "demons iii" in the title, one would assume it would. the problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the demons series. the distributors only a "demons iii" above its original title "the ogre" to cash in on the other films popularity. the new american dvd release of this picture has the title "demons iii: the ogre" on the box art but the film itself only says "the ogre". i don't know if past releases had the title "demons iii" on the actual film itself, but this new release just seems to be a little white lie. if you can get past the "demons iii" in the title, you might some enjoyment in "the ogre". it starts out with a creep intro, and stays pretty creep throughout. there's no gore and the film movies slowly, but i still dug it. just don't expect it to be like the other demons films. i give "the ogre" 7 out of 10. italian fans should try it out.

this is an excellent film and one should not be put off by its strangeness. there is genuine skill in manufacture of this work. it manages to be intrigiung, funny and frightening at various times. work with it for the first few minutes and you won't be disappointed

an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind? is he just getting old? the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on. there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. you knew what was going on and i liked it.the other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter. those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear. he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that, it was a pretty deep movie.

the premise of the story is simple: an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child, and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred. though very little dialog is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told by the camera's eye alone made the film quite engaging. the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness, which complements the quietness of the characters themselves. we can also sense helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which parallels the silenced child's inability to tell her own story.true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and irrationality. this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak.cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments. the ending is also unexpected and believable. reminiscent of japanese horror films, such as "the ring," and "dark water," or english horror films, such as "lady in black," and "the innocents," this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror. i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try.by the way, if you haven't seen the films i just mentioned above, you might want to give them a try as well.

don't be swayed by the naysayers. this is a wonderfully spooky film. this was a thesis project for the writer/director , jt petty. he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat. i never really knew what to expect, and for a jaded horror-movie goer, this is nirvana! the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods. one day, while searching for his cat in the woods, he witnesses the murder of a child, or does he? he agonizes about this the rest of the film. what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes. i found this to be intriguing. the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug. give this film a go, you won't be disappointed.

i really think i should make my case and have every(horror and or cult)movie-buff go and see this movie...i did!it-is-excellent: very atmospheric and unsettling and scary...incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low(read-"no"!)-budget they had....synopsis taken from website: "one morning, an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat. he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse..."on this website(imdb) there is no trailer, but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out...www.softfordigging.com

virgil manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse.chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property,manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods.he reports the crime to the police but there's no body to be found.troubled by disturbing visions,he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn"soft for digging" is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare.this minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue.some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent.the location sets provide plenty of creepiness:the eerie maryland woods rival those used in "the blair witch projcect".give this strange horror film a chance.9 out of 10.

i think that people are under estimating this incredible film. people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep. which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton. this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film.the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting, a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this. but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece...that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining.

a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth. (things must be pretty bad back on mars.) two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash. whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy's pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner.the diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning. now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus, although he didn't notice who they were. the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed. one of them is an alien, but which one? all of them are suspect. there's the crazy old man (jack elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit. there's a blustering businessman who must get to boston (john hoyt). a young couple on their honeymoon. (execrable performance by the husband, ron kipling.) except for the couples, nobody has noticed anyone else. and even the couples are suspicious of each other. bride to newly minted husband: "i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin." the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason, the lights go on and off, the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously.it's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle. there is no discernible "depth" to it. it's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens. it's not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses.i always enjoy it when it's on. it's especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm's version of shakespeare's play. and here he is -- with three arms.oops.

in a series chock-full of brilliant episodes, this one stands out as one of my very favorites. it's not the most profound episode, there's no great meaning or message. but it's a lot of fun, and there are some fine performances.but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is, to my knowledge, the *only* twilight zone episode with a *double* snapper ending. the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story. but this time, you get a surprise, and think that's that, but it turns out there's *another* surprise waiting. i just like that so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other being a deeper, more message-oriented one).

one of my favorite twilight zone episodes. and the next day we were in the supermarket at hollywood blvd. and la brea, my father and i, and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle! barney phillips, but no hat on -- at least, i don't think he had a hat on.we asked him about his third eye, and he said something like he left it at home, and everybody he met that day had asked him about it.a friendly guy. we used to see all kinds of character actors in la in those days.btw, i was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the "three hands" on the other alien! robyn frisch o'neill hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963.

a bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm. the police have closed the bridge--saying it's unsafe and they are stuck in a little café until the road has been cleared. however, after a while, their boredom is turned to concern, as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally on the bus and may just be an alien!! this leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low-brow way.this is another of the fun episodes of the twilight zone. instead of the typical twists or social commentary, this one features no lasting message. however, it's also very and watchable, so who cares?! exactly what occurs you'll just have to see for yourself.by the way, this one stars john hoyt--a face most of you will recognize from countless old tv shows and movies. in almost every case, he played a real grouch (like charles lane during the same era), but boy did i love seeing him--as he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time.

this is one of the more adorable episodes of the twilight zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments. there's the usual blond vamp "dancer" (what is up with serling's fondness for that kind of character, such that she keeps showing up in various episodes?) and other assorted characters, but it's jack elam's "old man" who totally steals the show. i consider this the funny, light-hearted version of "the monsters are due on maple street" -- or, perhaps, a 20-minute twilight zone parody of "the thing." on another note: i thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things -- he looked familiar -- but it seems that "ron kipling" disappeared after just two tv credits to his name.

rod serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development. there are no such shows now, but rather "housewife" sluts ala eva longoria or terri hatcher, or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens.jack elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that i can't help but think that rod serling was tailoring that long ago week's show around elam, even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story. this episode ends with a twist, as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with especially "serlingesque" dexterity.rex lewis field

after an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have crashed in a frozen wood, two police officers find evidences that the event really happened and apparently one martian had walked away from the spot. they drive to the nearby hi-way café and they find a bus stopped and seven passengers waiting the reopening of a snowed in bridge. however the driver tells that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus. while interrogating the travelers, weird things happen in the diner, with the lights switching on and off and the turntable turning on and off. when the passengers are released and the bus follows his travel, one passenger returns to the diner and discloses a plot of invasion of earth."will the real martian please stand up?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. the intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogs, funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point in the very end. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "o marciano" ("the martian")

nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense. somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken-down bus on its way to nowhere, but which passenger is it, (talk about your illegal immigrants!). all-star supporting cast, from wild-eyed jack elam (hamming it up shamelessly), to sexy jean willes (if she's the martian, then i say let's open the borders!), to cruel-faced john hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips (and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver). makes for a very entertaining half-hour even if the action is confined to a single set.

i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv. i remember my father remarking that "this is how it could have happened - adam and eve." i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve, her eyes were blackened. i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry. having not seen this episode in 45 years, i still remember it vividly - the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet, scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters, with the final scene of the two walking off, adam carrying his pack and eve following. it may not have been a theatrical work of art, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.

i just saw this episode this evening, on a recently-added presentation by one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes each weekday.as the gentleman opined in the other, previous comment here, i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series, but i find it entertaining nonetheless.my father was a friend of one of the principals (in my hometown, cincinnati), for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there -- and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there. overall "twilight zone" is certainly one of the true classics in television, and given its production during the height of the cold war period, provides not only a view of this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic picture of production techniques, creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago.* minor "spoiler."*this particular story depicts, as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story where the locale is meant to provide a "surprise" ending. sometimes the characters are on earth, from elsewhere, while the story at first implies at least one is an "earthling." these usually contained the message (as here) of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war period.viewed today, stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4-5 decades ago, and still provide some food-for-thought. -- as did this episode.while the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads, it still presents a simple, important message, and a worthwhile 20-some minutes of entertainment and interest.

this movie reminded me that some old black & white movies are definitely worth the look.initially i had some reservations, however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated. i was very impressed with the mixture of drama, suspense & comedy.arthur askey (tommy gander) is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time.definitely add this movie to your movie-night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or overly "funny" movies of today.

a timeless classic, wonderfully acted with perfect location settings, conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie. a simple story mingled with humor and suspense. i wish that a video was available in britain. i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with oh mr porter.

i have seen the recent region 2 dvd of this movie displayed in the "horror" section in an oxford street store and also advertised as a "classic thriller". in reality it is almost solely a vehicle for arthur askey, one of the most popular names in british comedy and light entertainment for over four decades.perhaps his incessantly cheerful, exuberant and essentially good-natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavour of much british comedy of the past twenty five years. however there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheery persona and total avoidance of pathos. askey was an idol of the great tommy cooper who frequently borrowed the "self-strangulation" gag that arthur attempts to entertain the stranded passengers with.there is a striking, rare appearance by the under-rated linden travers, who makes an impact as the mysterious julie.

in the colonies we're not all that familiar with arthur askey, so i nearly skipped this film (which had its tcm preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "ghost train" -- which i expected to be thoroughly annoying. instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. the physical aspects of askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby. there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. one can feel, moreover, the thread connecting askey to british comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. as for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.

if the very thought of arthur askey twists your guts, don't worry, you can still watch and love the ghost train, like the equally marvellous back room boy, it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance, even that of the lead actor. personally, i love askey, perhaps it's because i go into his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine, which is a mistake too many people make. the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep, dark world it transports you to, it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once. the cast are, without exception, extraordinarily good, perhaps linden travers lays it on a bit thick, but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime, she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out. the sad passing of the lovely carole lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past, but waiting patiently for us to press play.

as a matter of fact, this is one of those movies you would have to give 7.5 to. the fact is; as already stated, it's a great deal of fun. wonderfully atmospheric. askey does indeed come across as over the top, but it's a great vehicle for him, just as oh, mr porter is for will hay. if you like old dark house movies and trains, then this is definitely for you.strangely enough it's the kind of film that you'll want to see again and again. it's friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic references that made great wartime fare. the 'odd' band of characters simply play off each other as they do in many another typical british wartime movie. it would have been wonderful to have seen this film if it had been recorded by ealing studios . a real pity that the 1931 original has not survived intact

one of my favourite films first saw it when i was about 10, which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour. although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it. expect to see the usual askey & murdoch banter so popular in its day, with lots of interesting, quirky co-characters. the lady with the parrot, the couple due to get married and are in trouble from 'her', and my favourite, the stationmaster, "nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes.." interestingly the ghost train was written by arnold ridley of dads army fame (private godfrey the medic) watch it on a rainy sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile.

hello playmates.i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey, i have to admit i was very impressed by this film. as a fan of black and white films generally, passport to pimlico, the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder (who is apparently a distant relative), this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour. i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askey's performance, however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now.if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it,shame these films generally aren't shown on sunday afternoons anymore.i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley (private godfrey in dad's army).i thank you

this is a classic british comedy-thriller i had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now. it's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously (most notably in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version seems not to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake under review, the plot has been updated to the then-current wartime situation.anyway, i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will hay: given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings, smuggling and enemy agents, it's very much in that vein (it was actually scripted by hay's regular writing team of marriott edgar, val guest and j.o.c. orton); the stranded travelers element, then, was an equally tried-and-true formula. the star this time around is arthur askey (abetted by richard murdoch) - none of whose films i had watched before - who is as unlikely a hero as hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating...but one soon warms up to him, and askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split into two here, with murdoch acting as the star's straight partner.the remote single setting (the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night) provides for some wonderful atmosphere; the last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (raymond huntley and linden travers) and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is especially gripping and well handled. also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is kathleen harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink.

this film is one of those nostalgia things with me and i never really expect anyone else to "get it" but am pleased when i recommend it and somebody does enjoy it. my late father hated arthur askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "the ghost train" and "old ted 'olmes" transferred to me as a child. years later, i watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it. there is much to enjoy. the sequence on the train is truly inspired when askey and murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger. then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up. yes, it is dated and full of wartime britishness in accents and plot (based on the original play by arnold ridley of dad's army fame!) but full of wonderful character performances - including kathleen harrison as a dotty spinster. the atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an arthur askey vehicle could get. this is available cheap as chips in the uk on dvd so treat yourself. it is a perfect saturday/sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment. i thank you....old movies can be good movies!

this was fun to watch, spookily atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of world war two. the plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance.it must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the nazis - well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to britain from third columnists.but arthur askey was so annoying & unfunny you just wanted him to shut up - well at least i did ! i suppose different tastes in different times but the clowning around became tiresome. if he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded.a good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes - a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in austere times was like; uncomfortable slow, dirty trains, being thrown off for no reason, surly staff ....

the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940's humour. it incorporates world war two into the plot but not as much as i initially believed it would, and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well. askey, playing the role of tommy gander, is what brightens the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or "dragging".the story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards. it is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery which is the ghost train. gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well. he is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being "annoying" but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940's humour. his humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch.if it was not for askey/gander, than this film would of been shorter in action, enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion.

so your bairns are away on a sleep-over ? the wife is visiting the mother in law? you though are at home. it's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking? so now what are you going to do? i will tell you! go make an old fashioned cocoa (frys is best!)get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the dvd. now go select and play arthur askeys world war two thriller/horror the ghost train, return to that comfortable settee and enjoy the night in!the ghost train is a genuine british war time classic! arthur askey with his side kick,stinker murdoch, entertain you and i suspect the cast, to a high octane, thrills and spills, espionage thriller.it's set in old rural england during the second world war.it centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight, through circumstances outside any ones' control, in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train.the plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary! (the tale was written by that old boy godfrey of dads army fame and it is clever )arthur askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast, he also shows he can act a bit! the cast are never out staged though, even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas.oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer!

ghost train is a fine and entertaining film, typical of the better british comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s. the antics of comedian arthur askey are not as funny as they once apparently were, but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity.for a low-budget wartime production, ghost train is atmospheric, effective, and it provides some genuine suspense. great fun for a dark (and, yes, stormy) night. lighten up, take off the critic's hat, and enjoy.

now this is one of big's best, jack hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey & murdoch. it boasts a great stalwart cast, who ham the play up for all they're worth, especially askey of course. histrionics were provided by linden travers, melodramatics by herbert lomas, and pragmatics by richard murdoch.the group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all. his repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull. when the formula works it's very good, but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is. but those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any god britain hasn't got any nowadays!ultimately a nice harmless film, to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed!

i have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind, movies by will hay and abbot & costello especially as those are my favourites. i picked this movie up on dvd as it was using the same idea as will hay's "oh mr porter" which is one of the finest comedies ever made. i just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie finished at 12:45am). i find that movies of this kind, to do with ghost trains, etc, are best viewed at night time with the lights out. that way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie.the one-liners in the movie may seem a little dated to some viewers, i guess this depends on the viewer. they are not dated to me though. i am 28 and even though i am not old enough to have been around when this movie was first released (my dad was though). i still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind. sitting in the room in front of the tv with some snacks and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night while watching these movies, not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this. it is an escape from reality for a while.i noticed that one of the men in the movie (he has a black mustache) he appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes and he is looking for a woman he was followed to the station. this man was in the will hay classic "the ghost of st michaels" as well. just thought i'd point that out in case no one noticed :).the set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric. outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction, and the inside of the station is very cosy looking away from the rain storm that is outside. i felt like i would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast. the atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing from a lot of movies now. it keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes.we need more of this type of movie in todays market. but sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour. this sort of movie making era (the ghost train, oh mr porter, etc) to me is the golden age of cinema!.

curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused, irritated and frightened. the creaky old plot about about a phantom train that's said to run through the lonely english countryside at dead of night may be implausible, but it's a lot of fun. there are some wonderful old cliches like "the accident" which the locals can remember but won't talk about. but primarily the movie's a vehicle for comedian arthur askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits. askey's corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun. this is probably the best of askey's movies.

the question of whether or not one likes this film version of "the ghost train" invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone: your reaction to the performance of arthur askey.he tends to steal almost every scene he's in, and not always in a good way. sometimes you wish he'd settle down or back off just a little, to allow the plot's many characters to feature and develop (which they do to some extent). but somehow everything keeps pointing back to askey's tommy gander character.personally i like the film, and even like askey to an extent. i always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when i can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else. there is something about watching old b/w movies in the quiet dark of pre-dawn that i find appealing....

the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland, winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead. michael gaffikin (james warwick) a former paratrooper in the british army, is the local dentist, he's not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson (celia imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip(maurice roëves) at the islands police station, inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp, dr goudry, for closer inspection. a quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. over dinner that night with michael gaffikin, fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one colonel howard (jonathan newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength, one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer, another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain. with a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn't work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. reports of ufo's and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin's idea that aliens might be involved, but a rise in radioactive levels on the island, has him doubting himself.the nightmare man is based on the novel, child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire, it is here adapted by dr who and blake's 7 scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci/fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. the nightmare man though is on the whole, a succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down to the minor characters, time is given to giving them all a firm background. the island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over, but its one that i enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama, but credit to camfield, he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. there is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point. if there is one negative about the killer its that, we are given his/her/its pov for the killings, an acceptable cliché on its own, but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens, it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer, given the clues presented, but it's a fun and very well acted piece. the local scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. imrie, never one i've taken to in other works, is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production. the outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, it disappointed me in some ways, but taking into account when it was made, its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it, is even more terrifying.

this movie shows us once again, how genius the japanese directors are and were. this movie could be seen as a sort of a "silent - movie tetsuo". well eisenstein...:)

i saw "a page of madness" in a silent film course at wesleyan university and it haunts me still after 25 years. truly ahead of its time - perhaps even still - this gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness.

i have to admit, i wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my japenese film class, but this film really blew me away. the director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film, truly portraying a picture of madness. i think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind. this film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs. american, in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending, exercising the imagination very little.

it's easy to make really general comments about a film like this. the fact that it's one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it "started japanese cinema" and was "unlike anything the west ever made." the latter of these two comments is particularly false as kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off "caligari" on more than one occasion. but style was meant to be imitated, and doesn't take away from this film's importance. what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles, opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities. for this purpose, the madhouse is the ideal setting, and the writers knew this. this is a landmark film, and every effort should be made to track it down.5 out of 5 - essential

with rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum, and montage/superimposition of images, and vague, interwoven narratives, this is a very hard movie to follow. apparently a man (masue inoue) takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife, and maybe to rescue her. but she's clearly mad, huddled on the floor, with a vacant expression much of the time and fear, misery, and confusion written on her face the rest of the time. the film-maker switches to her point of view sometimes, and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby, or clutching at a drowned child. she's tormented by something. when the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks, the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things, showing us what mad people see and then how they react. and the place is swarming with mad folks, laughing, hiding, and in one case dancing frenetically night and day. at one point the man tries to take his wife outside, but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell. gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away, and he kills the doctor and many attendants, and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud. when he wakes he is relieved, and mops the floor. some fascinating shots of japanes life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.

this very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time. with its tumultuous emotions and net of visions, dreams, and startling images, its effect is both beautiful and unsettling. the actors are choreographed more like dance than acting. it contains the only dream sequence i know of that actually resembles a real nightmare (sorry, dali fans).

an old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and to try to get her out.this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of japanese cinema. long thought lost, a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack added to it, which fits perfectly with the images. it might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor caligary (director kinugasa claimed he never saw the german film). however it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing (and chilly) portray of the inner mental state of the inmates in the asylum. to achieve this, the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time: multiple exposures and out of focus subjective point of view, tilted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and superimpositions among others. it is also a very complicated film to follow, as it has not got intertitles.the film opens with a montage of shots of rain hitting the windows of the hospital, wind shaking trees and of thunder. the unsettling weather metaphors the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of the them: a former dancer. the combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to get into a frantic, almost hypnotic dance. in another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenzied dance, she is being watched by other inmates. multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients' point of view and their confused "view" of the world.these are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent the patients' subconscious and view of the "sane" world.in three words a must see.

just got through watching this version of "samhain", and even though i still like it, it's nothing like the "rough cut" version i have. if you check the message board, you'll see an apology from the director for this cut down version, 79 minutes., and he says he had nothing to do with this r-rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending. christian really doesn't need to distant himself that much, because the basic gore elements still stand up, even though highly trimmed down. this is a damn shame, because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years. it still has the porn stars, and the inbreds, and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen. i'm just glad i have that "rough cut", because to me, it's a jewel for any gorehounds library. christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods, and hopefully his next project will be better produced. the idiots had a near classic in their hands, and screwed it up for everybody. "samhain" may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever, and too bad gorehounds didn't get to see what the director intended.********************************************* just so you know what you missed, this is my review based upon the "work print" of samhain.the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops. there is absolutely no music soundtrack, and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog, because i think they are meant to be looped in later. however, most of the movie does have audio with sound affects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed. it's exactly as it says, a "rough cut", but the only uncut version of "samhain" you are ever likely to see. reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than even an nc-17 would allow. yes there are a few porn stars, but they are just there for the killing, and to add a little sugar and spice. the story is pretty standard, american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods. an area that is heavy on folklore, involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain, or as we call it halloween. (spooky)the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore, as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. this is a great gore scene, as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff, with her crying for help. all he sees is her head, arms, and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up, she has been completely sliced in two. this is what i would call extreme gore, with entrails, blood, and severed limbs all over the place. we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks, except the effects look much more realistic. i'm going to just skip the story, because it's your standard stalk and kill plot.the next gore scene is something to behold, as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location (tcm-2 stuff), and bound to a table. this geek then cuts all of his limbs off (off camera, with a cue to insert a scene), and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit, turning slowly over a fire, and the torso has a hard-on (if you can believe that). yes, very bad taste, gross, gruesome, you find the right word, and it will probably fit too.then later jenna jameson, her beautiful body and all, is cut from neck to crotch, and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee, and her blood drains into a pot. yummy, a real turn on huh?but the best gore scene happens inside the house, and i have to admit, this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen. this guy (doesn't matter who) is caught from behind from a geek, and cut open at the ass hole. the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails, intestines, and what the hell ever else there is, right from his asshole. this goes on forever, as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor. this is so extreme, so over the top, that i found myself laughing all to hell. obviously, you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd, imo, along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes.so, what to think of all of this. well, first of all, even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation, it makes this "rough cut" a rare jewel for gorehounds. yes, it's a little difficult at first, with no soundtrack, a few scenes to still be inserted, and credits that have missing names all over the place. but that's what makes this so unique, and i wouldn't trade it for anything right now. extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme gore. this makes "haute tension" look like a disney movie.

honestly, i was expecting to hate this one, and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it...but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed. a group of college kids and their teacher go on a "field trip" to ireland. their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace. the group of post-teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods - but being the stupid b-movie characters that they are - of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one-by-one... first off, there is plenty wrong with evil breed. the acting/dialog is pretty weak, and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson, chasey lain, ginger lynn, and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here - and jenna's role in this production is grossly over-hyped, as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time. even less with chasey, and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever. also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film. those gripes aside - there is some good stuff as well. richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on, with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half (though how she ends up this way isn't shown on-screen)...not bad for the first 5 minutes. the other kill scenes are pretty inventive, including jenna's forced breast implant removal, a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass, a knife through the face, and a few other notables. the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em, so to speak. also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored. the "creature" fx are also done competently which definitely helps. overall, evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected. this one, along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low-budget straight-to-video films. i usually steer clear of them as a whole, but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith. evil breed is no masterpiece, but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes - might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it - i know i was, and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience. 7.5/10

i don't watch much porn, but i love porn stars. and i love gory movies. so when i heard about a porn-star gore movie, i was really excited. of course, that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie, i never thought i'd actually get to see it. but i did and i'm not ashamed to admit i loved it, even with all its flaws.first, the flaws. the story is set in ireland and is called samhain, but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland. so why not just set it there and skip the third-grade report about samhain/irish immigrants/halloween? also, it breaks its own rules by stating that you're safe on the trails, but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere. it's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with. there's a big stone castle that's obviously ancient, yet no one's noticed it before. the self-conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters. the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met. the ending makes no sense.so what works? the gore! sure i would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn't afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie. two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene. the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd. i've always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that.

a bunch of american students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of ireland in order to study ancient religious practices. despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying off the beaten path (by the local creepy irish guy, natch), they do just that, and wind up with their insides on the outside courtesy of a family of inbred cannibals (the descendants of the infamous sawney bean clan, who according to the film's silly plot, upped sticks from scotland and settled on the emerald isle).if you think that porn stars plus low budget horror automatically equals tons of nudity and terrible acting, then think again: evil breed is bristling with adult stars, but in fact, there's not nearly as much nudity as one might expect given the 'talent' involved, and the acting, although far from oscar worthy, ain't all that bad (with the exception of ginger lynn allen, who we know can do marvellous 'french', but whose irish is lousy).evil breed opens in superb style with the brutal slaughter of a couple of amorous campers: after some brief under-canvas sex, the silicone enhanced hottie is dragged from the tent and torn in half; the guy has his arms and legs cut off and is roasted on a spit. it's a very gory start, and bodes well for the rest of the film.unfortunately, after this promising beginning, things start to go seriously downhill: we are introduced to the main characters, an annoying bunch of twenty-somethings just begging to become cannibal chow, and are subjected to a fair amount of time wasting in the form of some terrible false scares, a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local irish weirdo gary (simon peacock), and worst of all, some sub-scream, post-modernistic conversation about the conventions of horror films (how clever!).then, just as it looks as though the film is never going to get any better, director christian viel decides to get serious: a guy gets a knife rammed through his head and there's a gratuitous sex-in-the-shower scene featuring lovely blonde gillian leigh (not a porn star, but i'm sure there's a career there waiting if she wants it). after that, things improve rapidly as the cannibals kick into top flesh-eating gear, and the film is transformed into a veritable bloodbath: gary has a machete rammed up his ass (about time!), and is strangled with his intestines; ginger lynn kick-boxes a mutant; jenna jameson is torn open, eviscerated and has her silicone breast implant gnawed on by confused cannibal; a guy gets decapitated by cheese wire; and taylor hayes is seen bloody, bruised and naked with a dead foetus between her legs (apparantly, she's been captured and used as breeding stock).all of this is so outrageously gory that it makes sitting through the less interesting stuff worthwhile, and earns evil breed a final rating of 7/10.nb. a very troubled production and studio meddling resulted in christian viel eventually abandoning the project. re-shoots were done and the gore was heavily trimmed for a us release. the good news is that although the film doesn't flow as well as it might have, and is cursed with a terrible ending, the uk dvd (the version i watched) seems to have been left relatively intact as far as the splatter is concerned (only 13s were cut from the film in total).

this film evil breed: the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort. it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast "slasher" style death and plain disgusting acts of death. the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability, and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable. the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different. the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn't offer much, and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death. example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus, and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes. it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up. this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture.

if you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie, then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars? it's not as if they're inexperienced in front of the camera, they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name? christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard-gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema's sexiest and most notorious stars. jenna jameson, chasey lain, ginger lynn allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream reinvigorated the genre.samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in october 2002 - thus keeping in check with the halloween-based synopsis. unfortunately, the shoot was plagued by numerous problems, which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves. last i heard it had been signed by film 2000 here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd. unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slashers. not content with polluting our shelves with camp blood and its follow up, they were also responsible for unleashing granny, bleed and the rancid paranoid. could samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon? five canadian/american students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course. upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food. the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake, but it's rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of ireland to find refuge. after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre-fodder does in these flicks, the mandatory goody two-shoes (and definite heroine candidate) begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night. could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the forest? well what do you think? it looks as if samhain's production was jinxed right from the start. almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jameson's nude make-up shots, and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a drugged-out primadonna. finally to add insult to injury, the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re-editing and removing all the gore. reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating. veil of course disagreed, seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display. eventually after months of arguments, the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults.despite countless disruptions, veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium. the copy i was sent was the pre-release screener, which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack. but still it boasted a few credible jump-scares, some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i've seen for some time. one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine, jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend (richard grieco). even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome, samhain never feels mean spirited, which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clichés. in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall, because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven's scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them.certainly the inclusion of the mouth-watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers. her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top (as expected) and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes. but samhain is no soft porn movie, and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce. it's worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out-perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature, which isn't much of a complement. ginger lynn was at least notable (if you ignore the shameful 'oirish accent), and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou. taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics, which could have been caused by the numerous problems on-set. veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much-needed injections of suspense. exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds.it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain. rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending, and i'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution. if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched, then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years. this one is certainly worth checking out

out of the first five episodes of hammer's short-running "hammer house of horror" series, this fifth episode with the wonderful title "the house that bled to death" is arguably the creepiest one. as a great fan of the hammer studios' gothic horror films for many years, i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently. so far, i've only seen the first five episodes, and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are, i will be satisfied. whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror. the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations. years later, william (nicholas ball) and emma peters (rachel davies) move in the house with their little daughter sophie (emma ridley). soon after moving in, however, the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which is seemingly haunted... the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry, "growing pains" (episode 4), and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances. the film is also well-made in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "the house that bled to death" is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer-fans should like to see in a short horror tale. the film delivers a creepy atmosphere, genuine scare moments and intelligent twists, and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end. overall, this is highly recommendable to hammer fans.

perhaps not the absolute greatest entry in the hammer house of horror series, but it surely wins the award for most inventively titled episode! "the house that bled to death" i could yell out this title all day without ever getting tired of it! and besides the wondrous title, this short movie also benefices from a solidly written screenplay and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments. it might require an extra viewing before you fully understand the peculiar end-twist, but it's definitely an original idea for a horror short. the story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle-class house. the husband sadistically kills his wife and several years later the "cursed" house is still for sale. a young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and start to restore it, but mysterious events occur and affect especially the young sophie. her beloved cat is killed an even her birthday party gets ruined when one of the house's pipes suddenly sprays blood all over the guests (a particularly chilling sequence, this one!). is the old house really haunted? or maybe the seemly helpful neighbors cause all the horror? the answers to these questions are provided in the original and fairly unpredictable climax and there's even room for a real shock at the very end. the tension is masterfully built up and the titular house is filled with eerie scenery, like the pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to slay his wife. little warning though, the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when you're an animal lover. in conclusion, another winner for hammer's short-running tv series!

william (nicholas ball) and emma peters (rachel davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of restoring it. they move with their daughter sophie (emma ridley), and become friends of their neighbors jean (patricia maynard) and george evans (brian croucher). however, eerie events happen in the house, inclusive the death of sophie's cat. in sophie's birthday party, a pipe leaks blood and they leave the place, disclosing a secret later."the house that bled to death" is a scary and one of the best episodes of the series "hammer house of horror". the fantastic twist, disclosing a secret, and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "a casa que sangrou até morrer" ("the house that bled to death")

return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original. it had black humor, good suspense, nice looking girls, and of course, a psycho killer. what are we missing? i think nothing. except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television. besides being one of the best sequels, it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. recommended for everyone.

the first was good and original. i was a not bad horror/comedy movie. so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch it.what really makes this movie work is judd nelson's character and the sometimes clever script. a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay. sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy-look.great made-for-tv movie. it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson's stanley doing what he does best.i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel, just so you'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background.

actually... that "video camera" effect, is just that, it's an effect, a rather good one.. (u don't know much about directing a film do you?) this film is in fact better than the original, it's great fun to watch, made for tv, doesn't need to follow any rules. i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl, its disturbing. and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it, we as the viewers are on his side. i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it. watching this film you can understand how real movies are made, as this is sort of like a film within a film. judd is one of the scariest villains ever, and he's more realistic, he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors.

as a sequel,this is not a bad movie.i actually liked it better than the 1st one.i found it more entertaining.it seemed like it was shot documentary style.at first this bothered me,as i thought it just looked too low budget.but it grew on me,and it made the movie seem more authentic.this movie has more dry one liners than the original,which is a good thing,in my opinion.i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters.it almost becomes a parody of itself,which may be the point.this movie at least has some suspense,which the 1st one did not have,in my view.it has some of the same great music from the original,which is great.the acting again was pretty decent for the most part,though like i said,some of it seemed over the top.i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow,like the rest of the movie.overall,though,i thought this was a pretty sequel.my rating for "return to cabin by the lake" is 7/10*

when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie, i wanted to watch. it took me weeks to realize that i've seen the original of this and loved it. so i had even more reason to watch. well, i watched. it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies. i hate what happens to brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and i didn't like most of the characters, brian's one included. but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make stanley caldwell (judd nelson) shine once more. at the end, i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending. if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood, i'd suggest you watch this.

this movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake.i have been a fan of judd nelson's work for many years, and he blew me away. its a blend of horror, and drama ,and romance, not so much comedy. his evil, yet charming look captured me right then and there. that look in his eyes, i will never forget. there's something about him, i cant describe.

i loved this movie. it was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he kills men also. and the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly, when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberly's last moments before she is thrown to the water, and secondly, when stanley is visiting allison in his basement, right before they head down to the set, when she kisses him. those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. i gave the movie a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, i mean, there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong, like its being shot the way a film is usually shot, you wouldn't see the "live" camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. what went wrong??

class reunion is a very underated comedy gem. it's 1982 and the 1972 class of lizzie borden high return for there 10 year reunion, among them are the usual stereotypes, the hunk, babe, the fat guy & nerd etc, but the former students are in for a bumpy night, one of their classmates is walter baloer, the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home, walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation,,,,despite the dark premise, this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags & set pieces. to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun & airplane movies you'll love this, & what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry?. a great comedy which deserves a wider audience.

i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed. it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be. the fact that it was written by the usually dependable john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue. (by the way, i also think weird science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by hughes).the film has a very garish look to it using all the primary colours - reds, yellows etc - which makes it look quite unique. the cast are also quite good. the prudish bunny packard and the devil-possessed delores salk are a stand out.the film has certainly dated a little but i personally prefer it to all the other 'lampoon' series.

national lampoon's class reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters, lots of laughs, and some great music from chuck berry. when walter bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion. one by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl, a horny fat guy, the high school beauty, the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool. this film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so i wouldn't recommend it for young children but it's a great movie for teens. if you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or killer special effects you might not love class reunion. if you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun (and who doesn't) then this movie should be on your movies to see list. ++

personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem. way back in the eighties, the early eighties, i discovered this movie, like so many released at the time, "night patrol" "bad manners" or even "king frat" the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you.of course being of an age, movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like "screwballs" and the many others, captured the imagination, and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches.made many years after the huge success of "animal house" and having seen how it had fared down through the years, i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory, much like that of national lampoon's vacation.to be honest, not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success, however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies, with instantly recognisable characters, such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham, so good in charles band's "terrorvision" still lingering in the past glories of his youth. or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs.sweet as. which makes me ponder. as i already said, personal taste not withstanding. people can be so cruel, so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world. it does have some merit. being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes, who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work "weird science" as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u.s bonds.what more can i say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.

this movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. miriam flynn is excellent as bunny packard. zane buzby as delores is comic genius. the rest of the cast is amazing, and the film is really really funny. a definite satire of horror films, with a zany twist. if you enjoy a fun, comedy filled evening, then go and rent this classic. you'll laugh all the way through!

did you know, that anthony kiedis, (singer from the red hot chili peppers) father is in this movie. blackie dammit, is anthony's father. i noticed this after reading "scar tissue" anthony's autobiography, and saw a picture of his father. i thought, "well, that guy kinda looks like that guy from that movie i saw in the eighties. then i read more and it said his father was an actor that had a few small roles. after checking this site, and comparing with a search on the net, i realized it really is his father in the movie. it's funny, because nowhere in the book does it mention him being in this movie. perhaps his son was ashamed of his father's acting job in this flick, but he need not be. i think his father, blackie, did a great job in the show.

sequels hardly ever live up to the original. this definitely proves true in this case. however, if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch. although the camera work is lacking, brian krause's character is annoying, and the plot is clique, it's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it. don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film. quite frankly it's a bit different. rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays, stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project, cabin by the lake. this movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see stanley back in action.i'm giving it a 6 out of 10.

i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while. sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die, stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant. it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died. my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. judd nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell. brilliant movie.

i don't know if i'm just weird, but i thoroughly enjoyed this film. return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake. in fact, i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. i also thought that the cast in this movie was great, judd nelson is always the best! i also enjoyed the plot as a whole. i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanley's screenplay cabin by the lake- it wasn't a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them. - if you're looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you. however, if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. i've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film. :)

a highly atmospheric cheapie, showing great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create an eerie and moody texture. the story is farfetched, the acting is merely functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative. this movie is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its story.

probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made, this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last. director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what's more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen. not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn, but the setting is absolutely out of this world! just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging, pervasive fog. this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbar's inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players. the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, spirited yet vulnerable. robert barrat delivers his usual no-nonsense, straight-down-the-line portrait of the local bigwig, though it's hard to believe that the personable, good-looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer/director blake edwards.

very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty-row film company prc who usually put out really cheesy films like devil bat or the flying serpent. german expatriate director wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio-bound swamp set. gaunt and ghoulish charles middleton is effective as the strangler.

prc which was the lowest of the low actually struck gold with this moody little thriller. they did the same thing a year earlier with "detour" which is probably one of the finest low-budget films ever made."strangler" is basically a one set film, filled with mist and shadows, a technique used by most poverty row studios to hide the sets, or lack thereof. but here, it works well. the ghost of charles middleton (better known as ming the merciless) lurches around the swamp killing those involved in his wrongful execution for murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer. his final victim is to be the daughter of the ferryman.....he concentrates his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well.rosemary laplanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style. she offers herself up to the strangler in order to put a stop to the killing but as a sop to the audience, the strangler sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the hereafter, somewhat chastened. if ulmer(who directed "detour") has directed "strangler" she would be hanging from the nearest tree and the strangler's job would be done. but who's complaining? it's not the story that is the major attraction but the shrouded sets, lighting and the general moodiness of the piece. it stands, right behind "detour", as prc's finest hour

**** includes spoilers ****i've been a horror film fan now for many decades. just when i think i've seen all the great ones another pops up to surprise me. i had never seen this film before. it was a treat, off the beaten path too...not just the path to the swamp ferry boat either. here was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different. the pretty girl is (gulp) fearless for a change and saves the men, including the man she loves, from the monster ! how is that for a twist. this girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of that time, no screaming at her own shadow, no fainting from fright, no tripping over a leaf as she runs. this gal wasn't afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far away from the rest of the villagers. not only that but the place was on a foggy swamp rumored to be haunted. heck she even takes naps on the swamp grass outdoors...like a regular 1940s version of ripley. no snake, gator or ghostly strangler would dare bother this gal. books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked work.see this if you are a fan, like me, of those wonderfully atmospheric classic b/w horror films they made only in the 30s and 40s. and be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection.

some people say this is the best film that prc ever released, i'm not too sure about that since i have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries. i will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they, or any other studio, major or minor, ever released.the plot is simple. the ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring. into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims, the current ferryman. she takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves.shrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film.listen to the rhythms of the dialog, especially in the early scenes, their is poetical cadence to them. likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death, innocence and guilt. the film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film. its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history.this isn't to guild the lilly. this is a low budget horror/mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained. its tale of love and revenge is what matters here, not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost (the technical aspects just being window dressing.) if there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production. the fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land. the constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else.don't get me wrong i do like the film a great deal. its a good little film that i some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken. its definitely worth a look if you can come across it.

strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc and is certainly one of their best movies i've seen.a man who was hanged for a murder he didn't commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him. he uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. the old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married.this movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres, which makes it very creepy too.the cast includes rosemary la planche, blake edwards and charles middleton (flash gordon) as the strangler.strangler of the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself. excellent.rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.

i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon.com based on my other interests. they hit the nail on the head with this one. i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it. ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time. lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together, even though they are somewhat rivals. almost representing good (caleb) and evil (sherriff lucas buck). i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that i don't believe were granted by anything holy. he can make phones ring, writing appear, or even cause a person's emotions to change. none the less, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all. all in all, this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of, (i.e. point pleasant, threshold, nowhere man, and seaquest dsv just to name a few) were cancelled way before their time. the steven king's the dead zone ( sunday's usa network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it. there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore. this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv. so, in the meantime, i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch "quality" shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is).

recently when i was shopping, i saw the box-set of americian gothic, and i thought 'i remember that!' i used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was on ch 4 in 1996 at 1.30am (i was 14). i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck (with a b!!) no one ever was anyway. what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box-set as when on tv. episodes in funny order, i kept thinking when does dr matt leave??? - they made it so confusing. however this is not the writers, producers or directors fault (its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same - just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they don't like originality in studios!!!!!)to finish - if you've not seen this and you call yourself a sci-fi fantasy, horror, supernatural drama..fan = you must. they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the box-set.

i don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! it was a great shame when it was canceled, and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. the good news is that it is out on dvd!!!! i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it. gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character, and all actors were very good. it is a shame that the network did not continue it. shaun cassidy, this is a masterpiece. anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must do so. you will not be disappointed. my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan. she finds it "very twisted" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.this show rocks!!!!

i recently purchased the complete american gothic series on dvd and it lived up to my memories of it. i was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never televised. i loved "ring of fire" in particular of the stories i hadn't seen the first time around.gary cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" lucas buck. lucas black as caleb is also a superb player. i thought brenda bakke as selena coombs was also superb in her portrayal. in fact, the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other.it's a shame the series was screwed by the network (in collusion with a burgeoning group of censors) because it was truly designed for adult viewing. a mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance and horror genres, it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level.i had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life. long live gary cole (sheriff lucas buck), the most luscious "fallen angel" ever.

i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd (yay!) it's striking me as fresh, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired.the central performances are gripping, the scripts are layered.i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035.i've been asked to write some more line (it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever! pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way.)well, unlike imdb's submissions editors, american gothic understands that simplicity is everything.in 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation.when the show first aired, i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off. personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years. reckon it don't get more controversial than that!

"someones at the door". ohhh, how i miss this show so bad.. but we are lucky to now have "invasion". thank you, shawn cassidy. american gothic, had it all.if i had to pick one thing that i liked best about the show, it has to be its "not predictable plot-lines". favorite actor was lucas black.. i adore that southern accent. i bought the dvd asap, and my kids are fans too. there is some hot n steamy scenes. some devilish ones too. so, if kiddos will be watching you may want to edit(fastforward/skip). it has humour, on a joss wheedon level, which so many shows lack. adult wit and adult situation, that are handled with finese. the dvd has some extras, but i wish it has many more. if you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show, come watch "american gothic"!

it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were great as well, and complimented one another well. i was sorry to see it cut off.. i would have loved to see where it could have went.you found yourself leaning toward lucas buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. lucas was frightening and alluring. and i would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. i will however buy the show just to enjoy, it was great to something different on tv. and paige turrco who was caleb's cousin, she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to lucas. its a shame it isn't around still.. or was never finished, i would have loved to see what would have happened.

i love the series! many of the stereotypes portraying southerrners as hicks are very apparent, but such people do exist all too frequently. the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well, but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well. some things never change, and we see the "good old boys" every day! there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen, and the storybook "po' white trash" are all too familiar. aside from the supernatural elements, everything else could very well happen in the modern south! i somehow think trinity, sc must have been in barnwell county!

this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk. the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it. all you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that i can see) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination. i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that's just so unbelievable. what a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that.

i watched the show 10 years ago and loved it!!! am now in possession of the dvd and was watching the series, and waiting for scenes i knew were in the show (when lucas confronts gail in his house)and realized it was missing - all of a sudden i was watching the seduction without the lead up. then i went on line to check out all the bios of the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out of order. thank you!!!!! but there seems to be some conflict. some comments state "strangler number 19 then triangle 20, when another had them around the other way. and also potato boy 5, and dead to the world 6, were reversed as well. can someone clarify?????

i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of david lynch's twin peaks - a show which i adore. the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot, its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season. my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by the show - probably not through its own fault, as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season, it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got. the acting is excellent, and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil) in it i have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time. there is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic, but this is rectified as the season progressed. well worth a watch, definitely something out of the ordinary!

i could never remember the name of this show. i use to watch it when i was 8. i remember staying up late when i wasn't suppose to just so i could watch this show. it was the best show to me. from what i remember of it, it is still great. this showed starred lucas black making him the first boy i ever had a crush on. i am from the country, therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me, but for him i would definitely make an exception. which after seeing crazy in alabama, friday night lights, and tokyo drift you should see why. he is a great actor and has been since he was a kid. i miss this show and wish it would come back out. if anyone ever sees where they are selling the season please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com

i remember watching american gothic when it first aired, it came into my mind recently, all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight caller, which is gary cole, i don't watch much tv, but i watched american gothic, i purchased the complete series on dvd this week,& it's still as good as ever, this is one of the best tv series ever, the reason i don't watch much tv is because it's just rubbish that's on, except for derren brown, it's all reality tv or soaps, such as grease, big brother etc, i'm fed up with it, i got the complete series of american gothic for £16.97 form the asda website, that's the cheapest i can find it.

this was one of the best shows ever made for tv. full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. compulsive viewing. i was lucky i saw this in the uk. they might have got the episode order wrong, i can't remember, but it at least was on at a regular time every week. my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in, and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally.after the pilot, we knew this was something special. we missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.great casting, superb acting. gary cole was absolutely brilliant, better even than his role as custer. lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid, and paige turco was at her best too since party of five. and nick searcy of course, as the sheriff's long suffering sidekick.yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which i presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. that made the ending weak, and you could tell they'd killed it. made us go what? why did they do that with one of the best shows ever? shoot the exec.

ag was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv. sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies. we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas. we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising. this show lived up to the "gothic" moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less mastered. the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. this show puts shame to the current glut of "reality" shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.the call for a dvd box set is well based. this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. a public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. bring on the dvd box set!!

i may have seen an episode or 2 when the show originally aired but when i watched 1 episode on netflix i was also hooked. i watched the whole series in like 2 days. :) i really liked gary cole's character. first he's thoroughly reprehensible then you start liking the character ("these things have a thousand uses")! his folksy andy griffith meets charles manson meets satan is great. charming, charismatic, smarmy, and uh kind of dangerous and by "kind of" i mean "really". i wanna be like him when i grow up. lucas black is great too. the accents are great too. anyway, i thought this was one of the best tv shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.

i see a lot of folks on this site wishing ag would come out on dvd. well, i bought it on dvd. (from borders, no less!) while it is great to have this terrific show in a boxed dvd form, i am upset by the fact that they added very few in the way of "extra's" (a director commentary from shaun cassidy on the pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on tv. the missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on sci fi channel are in the box set, but are tacked on the final dvd. if you buy the dvd set, get the actual order they are to be viewed and you will be happier. (you will need to swap dvd's in and out of your player to see them in order, but you will be glad you did.)s

after realizing what is going on around us ... in the news .. in our homes .. the whole new world .. i remembered this show and how obsessed i was watching it every week (in my town) ..i started looking for this series .. 3 days ago .. didn;t have luck till this moment .. and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs ..people, i believe they stopped the show because it's talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world ... it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying ..the people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world now .. i remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the one dollar and the pyramid with the one eye ...

14 years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made. the writing was 1st class and the production second to none. this show would never be made today and that this a shame. i hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do. ag came out the year i left high school at the time my fav tv show was the x files this gives you an idea of why i first got into this show. ag was a far better program with better writing but only got one reason? i know this is not the only program to only get one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunman (x files spin off) it had good writing and was funny but also only got one season. it does not seem right! we also have to remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows 'cool' so i think this may have also let to the show going down hill. watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.

i really like this show. i can readily see how it achieved cult status. it's original, and thought provoking. for some reason though, i have never felt the kind of resonance from it that i could have. it doesn't pack the kind of open door, winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise. each time i watch an episode, i find myself prodding, and pushing for it to answer some nameless, formless question.before continuing, let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion, and my opinion only. different strokes for different folks.i would have liked to have seen more scenes in "american gothic" that were shot at night. there's too much daylight in this show, and i think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense. we're not afraid of the daylight, after all. we're concerned about what's in the shadows. the devil isn't always in the details. what we're not seeing is often the most frightening.second--and this is the one that's probably going to lead to tar, and feathers: gary cole is a tremendously talented actor...a character actor. i've followed his career from the brady bunch films on, which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as lucas buck. he's almost too petroichan, too likable to be embodiment of evil, even by biblical standards. lucas buck is a narcotic. he's heroin. he's freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of drain-o. you keep going back, even though you know the end will be madness, and death. he should be like the ultimate loan shark. he's a maker of book, but also of unspeakable condemnation. sure. you've got the money, and before long you're also going to have broken fingers; a severed hand, a decapitated head, and eventually, a damned soul. turning to buck is an act of desperation, and whenever he's around, there should be some immediate, ambient finality--with interest compounded daily--in the air.it's all largess, all strings attached, and by the time you realize that, you'll also know that it's too late.which leads me to three: they showed buck a little too often. he's in most of the scenes, in fact, which may have caused him to lose his edge. the sheriff would be like the next door mythology. he's the apocryphal acquaintance. many would know 'of' him, but only an unfortunate few would really know him. he'd be the stuff of flashbacks, and cryptic conversations, and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that nick searcy portrayed.four, the show could be very self-reverential--to a fault, some might say--and this is typified by the whistling of "meet me at the fishing hole" in the series pilot. i think we've already established that what cassidy, and raimi were shooting for was the anti-andy taylor. we probably didn't need the concept delivered to us via fed ex. i gathered that within the first five minutes so, for me, the piano on the head was unnecessary.these remarks are all about what, for me, would have made a good show great. i also understand that the producers had their own, unique style, and that there were many hands in the soup. in their everlasting quest for lcd programming, the network played a definite role in the demise of this series.the least these jerk-off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order.get real.either way, it's a grievous loss to both genre fans, and casual viewers alike.

they had me from the first show.welcome to trinity county. a sleepy little mayberry-like place with one slight difference. the sheriff is really satan. there's the spoiler. not like you wouldn't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway.oh, but that's not all. it turns out that satan has a son named caleb. some people are trying to keep him good, but it's an uphill battle. sheriff buck (satan) knows who caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. subtle. sneaky. he doesn't always come off as evil. most of the time he's a hero. everyone owes him a big favor, because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it. so every time you think someone will finally take him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it.in one of my favorite episodes, lucas and caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them. lucas used it as an excuse to teach caleb a lesson about evil.the robber (ted) was hesitant to shoot them. lucas told caleb that ted had half a conscience. if he had no conscience, he would have shot them by now. if he had a real conscience, he never would have become a criminal. so he started calling him half-ted. it was pretty funny. he was taunting the criminals. and of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half-ted at all times. and of course he was in complete control at all times. they actually had you favoring satan.very very excellent show. it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernaturalthat's good company.

i loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when i found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued! for years i hung onto my copies of this show, ones that i had taped or had someone tape for me. that is until now. the powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on dvd and i finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set. which, brings me to this part; the part about that this show is all about.american gothic is about good verses evil, basically a struggle between lucas buck (that is buck, with a b). he is an evil sheriff of a south carolina small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way.i felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived. i really hated when it was canceled, but that is the way it seems to go for me when i finally find something worth watching on television.gary cole did a great job as the role of sheriff lucas buck, he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off. the other actors did a super job as well, so i guess you could say, even the casting was a hit with me.

definitely spoilers in this review! i **adore** american gothic and have done since i first saw it late at night when it first aired on ch4 in the uk when i was 14. the comparisons made to stephen king are just about right. it's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters. best of all, and the reason i love it so much, is it had the guts to never be black and white! lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by, as he says, giving people enough rope to hang themselves with. his manipulation only works because of other people's weak morals. caleb though generally a thoughtful, kind, insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father. none of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in the plague sower. not only that but having gail, the closest thing to a mother figure for caleb, not only sleep with but fall in love with lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it. i'm a huge buffy fan, but when that show tried to go really 'dark' in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it's humorous side and didn't commit fully to its ideas. ag shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show, and still have a hell of laugh doing it.i can't even think about why it was cancelled as i'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all. so much rubbish on tv and good, original shows get kicked around and stamped on. thanks to the emergence of dvd at least i can see the show in it's entirety! yes some of the visuals look dated now, but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines. the actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work.the only reason why i think someone may not like this show is that it isn't like the x-files where there are cases to 'solve' or lost where there's huge unanswered questions. it's pretty obvious from the get go that lucas buck has some kind of evil powers, and that the show is all about fighting for caleb's soul. so this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown 'truth' to find. yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects, with some such as the truth about gails parents getting resolved, but unlike lost and x-files this show isn't about trying to find out more 'facts' about what's going on imo. it's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of trinity. personally i would just get such a kick out of seeing lucas turn every situation to his advantage.all in all the main thing i have to say is check it out. i'm pretty certain most fantasy/horror fans will love it. also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure. the only hanging thread i felt was dr matt. having him not be in the final episodes is strange. i would have done anything for a second season, but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some tv execs appear to be i should be glad this wonderful show got made at all!!!

i stumbled on this series rather by accident. after half an episode, i was hooked. american gothic was a dark, strange series with gary cole as the mysterious, probably evil sheriff buck who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son caleb, played by lucas black. i was impressed with gary cole's sinister sheriff and i was even more impressed with lucas black. lucas black's caleb was able to stand up against sheriff buck, one of the most frightening characters ever created for a tv series. i have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as lucas black. if you were not lucky enough to see lucas in american gothic, see him in slingblade.it was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during it's short run.

i was so excited to see this film because i had always heard it was very scary.what's interesting about it is that it is a japanese film they decided to bring to america, but they actually filmed it in japan with the original crew! i think this made the film... more japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most japan-to-america horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to american audiences. the difference in what scares the japanese culture and what scares the american culture felt present throughout the film. this worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, tokyo pond.the storyline was quite confusing as well. in typical japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. the beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the end of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. this constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. also, i didn't think some things were explained so well and i had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story).overall, there is plenty for american audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.

karen goes into a japanese house as a substitute nurse to emma, a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night. karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she encounters a frightening ghost. she will learn the house's secrets.it is very scary! the scenes are shocking and frightening! the characters are good. the settings are creepy. i love the whole plot! the ending was shocking! i paused at a scene where the little boy meowed so loudly to the man finding his sister upstairs and i was shocked. this is the scariest movie i have watched. i did not see the japanese version. i recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!

haven't seen any of the japanese grudge-films, but i really enjoy this one. i rarely get scared when watching films. i can jump, if the effect and sound is startling enough, but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me. but i did get scared from grudge. maybe because i didn't expect anything at all when i watched it. i didn't expect getting scared. i didn't know anything about it either. that was probably a good thing.this is a film that you, apparently, either love or hate. most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge-films, but even though i haven't seen them, i believe it isn't right to compare any film, actually. this film stands on it its own.the story is weak, most people say. i don't agree. the story is minimalistic, and done so on purpose. the story-telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done. the director knows exactly what he's doing, and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it.i gave this film 8 of 10. it is a film you will enjoy watching, or hate. it's as simple as that.

omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever, ever seen. to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement, and i have seen heaps (considering the limited availability in new zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before have i had to sleep with the light on...until i saw the grudge.some may say that it is a rip off of the ring (both based on japanese horror movies), both similar (yet different) story lines, but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema, i even screamed at a certain point in the movie.the acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. jason behr is a real hottie, and william mapother looks like he is having fun. however, while i am normally a fan of clea duvall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie. of the supporting characters, hers probably got the most depth and back story, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. as for sarah michelle gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she? the ghosts were genuinely scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (particularly the noise being made when kadee strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the ending was cool too.super highly recommended. 9/10

i wanted to see sarah buffy on the big screen, so i first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at imdb. i worried about seeing a bad movie. well, i had fun watching the movie. some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in buffy the vampire slayer.i don't consider this a bad movie. it's not a great movie either. just a rather well made horror movie. it does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. in my opinion, the acting was ok. sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. the other actors were definitely not bad either, i liked yoko.the sets are nice (and i don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the japanese original).the scary moments were often predictable. but not always. i have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. nice.the movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother.don't go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode, because it is very different from her buffy work, much more serious. don't go if you only want to see movies that gather oscar nominations. it's a good horror movie, enough suspense. i gave it a 7.

as i've noticed with a lot of imdb comments, certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness. i am not one of those people. if i watch an action film, i want to see explosions, gunfire and heroics. if i watch a comedy, i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. you get the idea. therefore watching a horror film, i primarily want to be scared. the grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. i've been a horror film fan for many years, and i'm talking about the masters such as dario argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days. if you want to be scared, watch this film. way scarier than the original japanese 'ring' (which i also think is a great film).

i saw "the grudge" yesterday, and wow... i was really scared, a good thing. i love horror-movies, and i really liked this one. there were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the english word?) that made you jump in your seat. though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. i think the most scary scene was... on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, or when yoko's walking without her chin. the make-up is also very good. sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. the boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared...

i'm not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically anti-grudge people are talking about here, perhaps it's just that some people like to rant about things.the movie was certainly imperfect (uneven acting, some may have had difficulties with the time-changes, actors all too willing to go places i'd really rather not go, etc.) but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections.first and foremost, i loved the 'breaking of the rules' bit. normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends, and find the token mysterious paranormal type. normally (semi-spoiler alert) when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through. normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood, or they've been freed, or whatever.secondly, the production was exceptional. while the movie was hardly special-effects-laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done.probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror (nothing against 'em, they've got their place), but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time distortions.

this was great. when i saw the japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie i had ever seen. it was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. when the mother ghost lent over the bed in the japanese version, i nearly had a heart attack... i was concerned that the american version would be watered down, and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version. i needn't have been concerned. the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man. they also set it in japan in the same location, in the same house. in fact, the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of american actors. that actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of "strangers in a strange land" to the overall horror. not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and i thought it was an excellent touch.buffy actually does a very good job. she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. there are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to american horror movies, or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. in fact, it was easily as good as the ring which i also thoroughly enjoyed. i hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of ringu. we are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as "horror"!! 8/10

so, being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump (or fidget nervously.)definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out... a hell of a lot better than the ring. the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then so be it... i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared, so i have to say that this one is worth watching.now, you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line, because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story (i think that if it was shown in chronological order, it would have ruined the whole thing.)i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it... maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid.

massive multiple chills down the spine! i'm surprised there's people who didn't like it! i saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff! and i've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies! for crying out loud,i'm 22!!! i mean, ok, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. but the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! from the very start, hitting you again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorising scenes! so many clichés yet none fails to surprise/scare! you know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, boo! and you still jump off the chair. grab a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night! hats off to the japanese!

this is what i wrote to some friends earlier:holy crap, the grudge is, honest to god, one of the scariest films i've ever seen! i am either getting very soft in my old age, or sam raimi and ghost pictures did a kick a** job! (can't wait for boogeyman!)i was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished i had someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist in grudge. i saw the movie by myself.) i swear, there were many many jump scenes that were not expected! i felt foolish but my nerves did not care! i was on edge the entire movie, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically scary. i keep thinking of that sound, though, and i do not like it!i actually gasped aloud a few times, and cried, "oh" at one scene!! oh, yeah, i even half-covered my eyes a few times! word to the wise, though: i thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic. my dh hated event horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho, but i don't remember the movie so can't compare.i can't say i "enjoyed" this movie b/c i was terrified, but it was very very good and scary. the ending scene, too...whoa! for being a 32-year-old-mommy, i think i may have nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. please get out of my head ;)in summary, this is not a slasher flick like i grew up with (jason, freddy). this is a most-of-the-time spooky movie. perfect for halloween.two great trailers for this movie were boogeyman and the ring 2!!

"the grudge" is a remake of shimizu's own series of popular japanese horror films. shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new, so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride. he uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner. the nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. at the end, all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience (the same way a comedy is to make people laugh), this movie succeeded with flying colors. i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one. it probably doesn't play as well in your living room.

karen (sarah michelle gellar), an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, emma (grace zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, yoko (yoko maki), disappears. karen soon learns that something is not right in emma's home, and she attempts to "see how deep the rabbit hole goes".maybe it's a delayed influence from the success of m. night shyamalan's films, but slower-paced, understated horror films are a recent trend. in some cases, such as hide and seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as white noise (2005), the pacing tends to kill the film. i didn't like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek, but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. one, it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with ju-on (2000) (in particular, it's extremely close to the first half of ju-on: the grudge, aka ju-on 3, from 2003). two, as with many japanese horror films, the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror, the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.director takashi shimizu, also the director of the five japanese entries in the ju-on series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is atmosphere, creepiness, the uncanny, and for many viewers--scares. how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to, or are used to, this different approach to film-making (although admittedly, some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the ju-on series). traditionally, american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning "rules" for the "monster". a more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the u.s.however, even if you're not used to it, it's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot. this is a well written, well directed, well acted film, filled with unusual properties, such as the story interweaving a large number of "main characters" (which is done better here than the more episodic ju-on 3), good cinematography, subtle production design touches (check out gellar's clothes, which match the color and texture of the exterior of emma's house, when gellar first approaches), and beautifully effective horror material.even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing, and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu, have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore. although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture, it's interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.i subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a "here's what really happened" flashback, but even that was fairly well done, and otherwise, this would have been a 10 out of 10.now that i've said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: it's not that i'm anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that u.s. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. the original versions of these films should just be playing in u.s. theaters in wide release. there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for non-white or foreign actors. yes, the grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, i'd rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just japanese, but also indian, spanish, chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.

i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film. what i got was scare after scare. it's a horror film at it's core. it's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. this film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters. i think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. they become haunted no matter where they are. office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc. after reading some of the external reviews i am really surprised that critics didn't like this film. i am going to see it again this week and am excited about it.i gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should. it scared the s**t out of me.

i collect horror films from all over and i have seen the good and the very bad - zombie bloodbath is a low budget video. sure, the acting is bad, the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots. the thing you seem to be missing is that it's still entertaining and really very fun. the effects range from, like someone on here has said, pasty-faced zombies that look like kiss rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work. but the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area. the effects are very good for such a small film. someone called it a party movie and it is. 100% fun party movie. i have heard from various websites that this is actually a "rough cut" of the film that got general release but the actual "director's cut" is coming on dvd and it is very nice quality. i will buy it and judge for myself.story is basically a nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies. the gov't closes it down, hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it. some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area. a few actors do a great job, there's some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true, good music, great lighting, some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore. one guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up, if you know what i mean. then his guts are shoved out of his mouth. another is torn in half like in day of the dead and they did a great job of that effect. there are a million gore gags and it's almost all action. i say stop being a prude, enjoy life and get more movies like zombie bloodbath and meat market. two great undead epics.ok - update!!! i just got the dvd set and here is what i thought:much better picture quality and for once i was able to see the actual director's cut of the film and it is a much better movie. i liked it before, but now i can see what todd sheets was actually trying to do with this one. and the commentary helps too, hearing sheets talk about the film in detail, he knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to all people involved. also, sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well. i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn, fox and mtv. over all, a fun little film that is very rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! i have seen many dv films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. while newer dv films are technically superior, they just aren't this much fun!ps - i heard they are now remaking this on a big budget???

my room-mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and i finally got around to watching it. it is gross. it is cheezy. it is pretty dumb... but it is also a lot of fun. i mean, this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since "city of the walking dead" ages ago. it was like being at the old drive-in theater again! you could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. this one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one, and it's neat because it is suppose to be like that. the cheeze factor is high, the gore flows and the laughs roll! the effects go from sloppy to good, with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent! the acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good. there is not much plot, just lots and lots of gore. this one is patterned after the zombie movies from italy and spain i think, because they linger on the gross scenes forever, like this movie. if you like troma movies, cheezy b-grade stuff, then you can do no wrong watching this one. a nice way to waste a friday night!

i swear, that zombie was killed like twice, and kept coming back. i gave this movie an 8. let's face it folks, this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying, i.e., a "handy-cam", shot film. hey, hey, hey, welcome to total indy film making. the fact that todd sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents. yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over again, but who really cares? take it for what it is, a fun and gory horror film, one to share with your buds, or to gross out the people you really care about lol. mellow out people, i suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like "titanic" or "twister" instead. peace, and support independent film making!!!

i have to admit to enjoying bad movies. i love them i watch all of them. horror especially. my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a blast. this one had a great box, so i was expecting less than usual.the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed, and the other underground layers are simply covered up. the inhabitants of this neighborrhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave. this wakes up some zombies.from this point on, it's chunk-city. the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll.ok, it's not great art, but this one, with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening. actually, it was one of the best "party tapes" i have ever had the pleasure of watching. and you could tell it was done on no money, with a bunch of crazy people. there are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like brendan frazer (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip.

i have to admit to enjoying bad movies. i love them i watch all of them. horror especially. my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a blast. one of the ones we got at hollywood video, was this one, zombie bloodbath. this one had a great box, so i was expecting less than usual.the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed, and the other underground layers are simply covered up. the inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave. this wakes up some zombies.from this point on, it's chunk-city. the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll.ok, it's not great art, but this one, with it's in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening. actually, it was one of the best "party tapes" i have ever had the pleasure of watching. and you could tell it was done on no money, with a bunch of crazy people. there are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like brendan frazer (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip.

i originally reviewed this film on amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and blasted it. i believe i called it "wretched" and a "turkey." okay, well, by most standards, it's still a turkey. it's got almost no production values, what little plot there is makes almost no sense, and the acting is on the level of a third-grade play. that said, this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic. in fact, all of director todd sheets' films have had this effect. they're almost like ed wood in that regard: watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines, continuity errors (same zombie, two different locations!), and other flaws.i'll say this: sheets is a very nice guy, and while this, one of his first productions, isn't that great, he has gotten better. and i must add that the only really decent actor/actress in the film is kasey rousch, though i may be biased, as i attended school with her.

zombie bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre. as i understand it from the commentary and things i have read, it was made during the huge midwest flood of 1993 when half of missouri was underwater. buildings were under water. cars and houses were underwater. one article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help sandbag the river after shooting each day. the fact this movie got made at all is a miracle. it is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a troma filter. it is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters. and it is fast paced and energetic and really funny.a toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies. the local government covers it up, tears down the factory and builds houses over it. some ground shifting (?) causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community. from there it just gets crazy and gory and fun.i have read these reviews on here a few times. and it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer, using fake names. they use the same words and sentences. zombie bloodbath is cheap. it is raw. it has some bad acting. so does half the movies made. there is much much worse out there than this fun movie. if you hate this film so much, don't buy it. there is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast "trailer trash." and it is obvious you are not from australia or england. it is just upsetting that this great service, the imdb does not catch people using it just to trash others. there are bad reviews and good reviews, and i don't mind those. i give both bad and good reviews myself. but it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. sad.some of these so called "reviewers" even basically sue their "review" just to promote their own movies. one called this film boring - well, love it or hate it, one thing you can never say about this film is that it is boring. it moves fast and never has a dull spot.oh and this reviewer from the netherlands??? um - liar. you tried to post this same review at amazon and it got yanked there. the same review only it said it was from missouri.this nonsense has to stop. love it or hate it - give it a real review or type nothing. it is obvious you have not seen the films.but for the record, i have and though this one is not nearly the best that i have seen, it is far from the worst. and even the worst i would give an actual revoew and would not attack the director personally.hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here.

just got my copy of this dvd two disc set and while not perfect, i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time. i have to say right up front that i am a huge fan of zombie movies, and i truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too. i also have a soft spot for people who are trying, sometimes against all odds, to live a dream. and again, these people are doing it. is this some award-winning collection of amazing film? no. not even close. but for what they do on their meager budgets, these films should be recommended. for me, the bottom line is always, was i entertained? did i have a good time with this movie? and here the answer to both was "yes." the first in the series is also the most raw. it opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something. cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site. some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility. they get rescued, but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole. soon, the whole town is overtaken by the undead. and these zombies are fun. they go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever, but they are fun. the whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead, with our heroes going into the reactor's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever! pretty cheesy, but i think it was meant to be. still, it moves very fast, has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style. the acting is uneven, but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track. i went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie. director todd sheets seems pretty proud of this, his first film, but also has no delusions. he knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to people involved. also, sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well. i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn, fox and mtv. over all, a fun little film that is very rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! i have seen many dv films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. while newer dv films are technically superior, they just aren't fun! overall, this is a solid, if a bit flawed, release with plenty of extras and tons of gore and splatter. while not breaking any grand rules of move making, i found the series to be fun and always a laugh, so i give this set a solid recommendation. todd sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks, he was trying, sometimes against all odds it seems, to make fun zero budget, splattery horror and to that end, he has succeeded in spades.

so, todd sheets once stated that he considers his 1993, shot-on-video z-epic, zombie bloodbath to be his first feature film. anyone who's ever seen a little beauty called zombie rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is. i mean, what makes this one that much more superior? well, then again, zombie rampage doesn't include that mullet guy, now does it? for one to comprehend exactly why zombie bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn, one must remember what the 90's were like for lovers of bad horror. a decade that all but said goodbye to b and z-cinema as we knew it. technological advances, awkward trends, and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s.o.v.'s big-boxed golden years. and anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self-aware for it's own good, basically defeating the purpose. luckily, not everyone changes with the times. enter zombie bloodbath.and i guess this is the part where i explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years. alright, so, some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight, turning them into flesh-eating zombies, who go on a rampage, inflicting some of the most gruesome, yet humorous gore-scenes of the 90's. the first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward-sounding conversations you could imagine. conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low-budget zombie flick, this is a z-grade disasterpiece, fella. plenty hysterical, non-existent acting to go around, and that goes triple for mr. mullet. that guy is truly the highlight of the night.the fact that todd sheets seriously considers zombie bloodbath to be that superior to zombie rampage, amuses me to no end. i mean really, both are complete jokes on celluloid, but then again, so is redneck zombies, so, obviously todd sheets is in the company of awsomeness. by 1993, a movie this bad would no doubt, be a full-blast spoof, but mr. sheets stands his ground, giving us some good old fashion schlock, the way it was meant to be, unaware, clueless, and pointless. god bless todd sheets. for anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90's b-horror, leif jonker's darkness should be at the top of your list. as for zombie bloodbath, if you're a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990, then '93 would be the perfect time to pick up. 8/10

a meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal, rot-faced, shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage. a ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal. director/co-writer/producer todd sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go-straight-for-the-throat lively and gruesome horror fare: he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout, fills the screen with wall-to-wall crazy action, and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum. moreover, sheets certainly doesn't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter: this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting, evisceration, lots of gut munching, one dude has his heart yanked out, and there's even a nice impalement on a tree branch. sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end (for example, almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow). granted, this flick has its fair share of flaws: the ragged editing, several ham-fisted attempts at pathos, and the largely awful acting from a rank no-name cast all leave a good deal to be desired. top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky kasey rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful daria trumillio. frank dunlay likewise does well as rugged take-charge army veteran ralph walsh. best of all, sheets' sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish.

will all of you please lay the hell off todd sheets!?! let's give you $30,000 to make a movie and see what you come up with! the guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free! sure the acting is laughable at times. yes the make-up is not greatest you'll ever see. but it's not the worst either, if you want to see that, go watch zombie nation with it's raccoon zombies.this is pure, good old fashioned guerilla film-making! todd is a consummate professional, and an all around nice guy. there are holes in the plot, yes. the plot does seem far-fetched. but what the hell, i still love this movie. i wish todd sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to. if anyone has ever tried to make a movie, they know that just finishing it, is an achievement in and of itself.

since i am so interested in lake monsters i really dug this movie. this movie is worth a see. if you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out. the effects are really good as well just think "land of the lost". i originally watched this movie in the early 90's maybe more like 89/90 on a local channel monster show called "morgus presents". i didn't scare me but i was 8 and anything b felt more like an a. years later i seen it on dvd at a local circuit city and bought it immediately so i can give it a 9 because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with the monster squad and gremlins. good b movie fun for all ages.

a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake . as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster.recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening. it's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal. its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it. this is a real drive-in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects. the monster, a mix of stop motion and a life size head, is a charmingly quaint little beast. the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem. sure its clear that its all fake, but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief? actually i think its about really cool monsters, which this has.i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way. if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther. this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films (boggy creek etc.)

c'mon people, look at the title! lol! i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago. it's a great, cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor. the 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie! lol, and you'll love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it's midday and sunny. bloody hilarious!!! you can tell they just didn't care about plot, they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible. bottom line, you'll love it if you love 70's schlock.

one of my all-time favorite so-laughably-lousy-that-it's-totally-lovable el cheapo and stinko nickel'n'dime independent horror creature features, an enjoyably dreadful marvel that was released by the formidably fecund exploitation outfit crown international pictures so it could play numerous crappy double bills at countless drive-ins back in the 70's and eventually wound up being rerun like crazy on several small-time secondary cable stations throughout the 80's. i naturally first saw this gloriously ghastly abomination on late-night television one fateful saturday evening while in my early teens and have had a deep-seated, albeit completely irrational abiding fondness for it ever since.a meteorite falls out of the sky and crashes into the still waters of a tranquil country lake, thereby causing a heretofore dormant dinosaur egg to hatch. of course, the baby dino immediately grows into a gigantic waddling, grunting, teeth-gnashing prehistoric behemoth with goofy flippers, an extended neck and a huge mouth full of little sharp, jagged, stalagmite-like chompers. our southern-fried male cousin to the loch ness monster promptly starts chowing down on various luckless local yokel residents of a previously quiet and sleepy hillbilly resort town. it's up to drippy stalwart sheriff richard cardella, assisted by the painfully idiotic hayseed comic relief brotherly fishing guide duo of glenn roberts and mark seigel, feisty gal pal kacey cobb and terminally insipid nerdy scientist bob hyman, to get to the bottom of things before the over-sized gluttonous jurassic throwback ruins the tourist trade by eating all the campers and fisherman that the hick hamlet makes its cash off of.director/co-screenwriter william r. stromberg displays a wonderfully woeful and thoroughly clueless incompetence when it comes to pacing, atmosphere, taut narrative construction and especially eliciting sound, credible acting from his hopelessly all-thumbs rank amateur community theater level cast. the performances are uniformly abysmal: cardella is way too bland and wooden to cut it as a solid heroic lead while the pitifully dopey redneck comic antics of roberts and seigel provoke groans of slack-jawed disbelief -- you aren't laughing with these two atrociously mugging clods so much as at them, particularly when the insufferable imbeciles discover a severed head bobbing up and down in the murky lake water. better yet, a clumsily integrated sub-plot concerning a vicious on-the-loose criminal leads to a spectacularly ham-fisted supermarket hold-up scene which degenerates into a hilariously stupid mini-massacre when a young lady shopper interrupts the stick-up artist in mid-robbery! a subsequent car chase is likewise severely bungled as well; it's so limply staged and unimpressive that one feels more relieved than scared when the monster abruptly pops up to devour the nefarious fugitive. moreover, david allen's funky herky-jerky stop motion animation dinosaur is the authentic gnarly article, projecting a certain raw charisma, sneaky reptilian personality and overall forceful screen presence which makes all the horrendously underwhelming human characters seem like pathetically unbecoming nobody bores in comparison. and as for the rousing conclusion where the sheriff takes on our slavering beastie with a bulldozer, the operative word for this thrilling confrontation is boffo all the way.

a meteor crashes into crater lake, the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch.alright, so the plot is just trash. but despite its obvious low budget, this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-on-the-loose films in existence. there are also some good moments of humor. in an age filled so-called 'monsters' which are no more than laughable men-in-rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces (cheap exploitation-style), it's refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen-style stop-motion creature.quite a hard film to find, but it's worth finding.

despite its budget limitations, this is a great film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash. the opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a nice red herring. after that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). when the prehistoric beast appears, it's a well-animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. alright, so it's not jurassic park, but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.

simple story... why say more? it nails it's premise. world war 3 kills all or most of the human race and we're viewing 2 of the survivors. the message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place. distilled down to representatives from each side, we see they have everything to come together for:security... finding resources... food, shelter, etc... survival... love...at the end they've decided to pool their resources, (she finally does), so they will survive. simple story, expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape. we see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable. in the early 60s, no one had seen such stuff... i give it a 10...

a lot is dated in this episode (just like most twilight zone episodes), such as the woman's incredibly sexist military "uniform." and some things are so unbelievable, like the easy availability of clean water. still, consider the year this was made and the time, and you quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch. it has a nice sense of hope, something missing from a lot of twilight zones, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely speaks), something else rare on the twilight zone. "two" is a great example of how the twilight zone, in just over 20 minutes, could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today. and it's great to see two people who became american icons so early in their careers.

this episode apparently grew out of the cold war. there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles bronson have come through unscathed. it then becomes a battle for turf. she is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. it's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. they come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. but it still is captivating and interesting. because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we can guess.

this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing "sandy" and the agnes moorhead-and-the-tiny-spacemen episodes.it is an important take, from mid-1961, on the long cold war that the u.s. was then embroiled in. the beaten-down city-scene, the near-starving characters' sparse dialog, their threadbare uniforms, and the minimal action "says" it all: the absurdity of an on-going conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and all that is sweet and redeeming about it.it is a "fable" because it was made in a time in which, had events turned out differently, such as the second berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent cuban missile crisis (oct. 1962), it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u.s.'s major cities, ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors. i also see it as a "fable" because it is not only a cautionary tale, but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: it is a love story, set in an impossible situation, and involving two highly mismatched lovers.

wow! all i can say is that if elizabeth montgomery is the enemy (she speaks russian), then i'm surrendering right now. in her short skirt, high-top boots, and pronounced bust line, she's a real babe, even if her zombie-like eye-shadow sort of comes and goes. this 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series. note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin, ruining all the fun. okay, probably i should leave off my hormonal response.this is a very well produced half-hour by that underrated force behind the series's success, buck houghton. naturally, the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry. it's post nuclear-holocaust america (we know because she's part of the invading force) and only american bronson and soviet montgomery are left, along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage. they wander among the destruction in alternating moods, while we wonder how long it will take for biology to trump politics, which of course it eventually does, (lucky bronson). and that's about it. no real talk, except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown. nonetheless, the screenplay is still entertaining, and rather daring for its time, even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular cold war stereotype of the time).in passing-- it's rather curious that the very slavic-looking bronson (buchinsky) would be cast as the american and the glossy-looking montgomery as the slav. appearance-wise, it should be the reverse. my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female, regardless of appearances. however that may be, there is little of the usual tz fright or atmosphere, still the episode remains a very, very watchable 30 minutes.

this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episodes, primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment.the cobweb-strewn shops and rubble-laden streets are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does best.while the parable can be a bit heavy-handed by today's drama standards, it is an excellent one - using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a way that is timeless. the entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of mr. bronson and ms. montgomery, who do not disappoint. (may they both rest in peace.)a true classic.

a woman who hates cats (alice krige) and her son (brian krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean teacher (glenn shadix), their incestuous relationship, a lovely girl (mädchen amick) and one hell of a big secret.okay, so technically, this is a "bad film". but, who cares? it's so very fun! impossible things (involving corn) happen, people freak out about kitty cats, there's bad one-liners, there's too much cheese to handle!so, yes. you will enjoy this. a lot. it won't move you, touch you, scare you, or thrill you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughing!

woah! is one thing i can say about this movie. personally i'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but i loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end.i liked the movie, but i have to admit it was because i found brian krause who played charles brady very very irresistible, i guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie.there was one thing that i was disappointed over. i've watched charmed before and brian krause is married to holly marie combs, his kissing scene was o.k. in sleepwalkers, but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with holly marie combs, i don't know if it is because krause and combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more, that was the only disappointment in the movie but i guess it was made up for with brian krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie.if you are use to seeing brian krause as holly marie combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie, he was nothing like angle boy. although now that i think about it, it would be great to see krause's character on charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in sleepwalkers.i also have to say the music was great in this movie too!

because of all the negative reviews of this film i almost didn't watch it. however, i was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie. the acting wasn't great - apart from the wonderful alice krige - but some of the dialogue ("just consider yourself lunch.") was quite amusing.on the whole an above average stephen king effort - 7/10.

sleepwalkers are creatures who drain the life force completely out of humans to survive...but they can only use virgins (it's not explained why). charles brady (brian krause) is one such who needs to feed his mother mary (alice krige). he goes after likable tanya (madchen amick). will she escape?on one hand this is a great horror film. fast-paced, plenty of blood and gore and a nice, twisted sense of humor. there are plenty of in joke references for horror buffs (castle rock is mentioned once). also krause is excellent (who would have thought he could act after "return to the blue lagoon") as is kirge and amick. but i find this film annoying.it was written for the screen by stephen king and it's maddeningly vague. the sleepwalkers are never fully explained. where are they from? why are they called that? why does the son have to feed the mother? why do cats hate them and can kill them? what are their powers after all (at one point krause makes a car disappear and change color and style!)? why do they need to feed off peoples' life force? why does it have to be only virgins? why is the son having sex with his mom? none of these are explained leaving the story confusing. it's really too bad because, those questions aside, this is an excellent horror film. excellent makeup and special effects too.fast, gory and lots of fun. if only the script were better. also a fairly explicit sex scene between krause and krige was edited (you can tell) to get an r rating. i can only give this a 7.

stephen king movies are a funny thing with me. i either really love them or i loathe them. some of the fancier productions (such as desperation and storm of the century) i didn't enjoy. some of the smaller ones, i really loved. sleepwalkers is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularly.the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary. they are sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. they are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. when they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. the story revolves around what will happen with the girl. will charles spare her or use her to save his mother.although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. like most stephen king stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. the acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption.for uk readers: this production has most recently been shown on bbc1, sci-fi and sky thriller/horror channels.

this is not a good movie but i still like it. the cat clovis is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the evil sleepwalkers. i think there is more to this movie than people realize, basically it is very harsh, but this brusqueness can sometimes be good. it's got the corny lines, the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen. did anyone find the incestuous element a bit disturbing? ultimately this movie is casually and randomly acrimonious, which is quite effective, i liken it to psycho - the relationship between the mother and son, the changing of protagonists. i think the abruptness works also, this is not a movie that you want them to lengthen, it only works if it's short.i'm still not sure whether the director lacked depth, or whether he did these things with purpose, we know stephen king has ability, yet i haven't even read his books, only seen some of his movies.anyway, i liked it. if you like harsh corny movies with 80's overtones just watch it. but don't expect too much. it really is so bad its good.

stephen king was raised on flicks like this. -flicks not films.movies like this and 'jeepers creepers' are "throwbacks" to the good 'ol day drive-in horror flicks. they are meant to be fun, cheaply made and hopefully: a few good scares.anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that's all this is... all it ever will be.stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash. -good, fun, trash!if you enjoyed this i recommend: 'jeepers creepers' 'jeepers creepers 2' '30 days of night' 'scarecrows'('88) 'they live' 'planet terror' 'death proof' and 'halloween iii: season of the witch'

monstrous mother-son-duo (alice krige and brian krause) sucks life-force of virgins, and their newest target is pretty but lonely tanya (madchen amick). however, these monsters are allergic to cat's scratches... i have never been fan of sleazy, overrated bestsellerists like king, koontz or barker, but this b-movie, written by mr dung himself, is actually not near as bad than it could be. yes, it is sometimes jaw-droppingly atrocious, but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old-fashioned graveyard, eerie soundtrack and candlelit-gothic-house-scene, mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains, etc. of course, the film is polluted by mr dung's potty-mouthed dialogue and all-tactics-of-toilet-seat obsession to vilify fat people, leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher, but there is roses among manure.

although written by stephen king, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is actually quite entertaining b-movie. vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins, great graveyard scenery, heroic cats and very pretty virgin. the soundtrack even has enya's music, an idea which i found quite... nice. i'm sure king is disappointed to this little movie, although it has crappy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious king potboiler. (albeit sleepwalkers, if i'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). still, those touches of sewer-odors show he didn't use a ghost-writer after all...

best stephen king film alongside it, though this one is more fun than scary. this one's got it all: -a great cast with a alice krige and brian krause and a fun cameo from king himself;-well dosed horror in an amusing storyline;-great use of music, santo & johnny's "sleepwalk" in particular;-likeable characters in a typical king setting: middle of nowhere village;-lots of humor. you can't really get good scares here because it's too much fun and over the top;-old but really nice makeup effects like they don't make anymore!a 4,5 rating: i don't get it really. when was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one?

there's a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn't direct a horror film of quality if he had to. and, sleepwalkers(..screenplay written by stephen king)is often used as an example of this. i like sleepwalkers, though i fully am aware that garris just says f#ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie. forget character or plot development, who needs them anyway. it's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of "sleepwalkers"(..feline-human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents, moving from town to town, living a nomadic existence, truly powerful)set their sights on a teenager who doesn't surrender without a fight. before all is said and done, many will be slaughtered as a mother shan't tolerate the possible death of her beloved son.garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed, as a teacher(glenn shadix), suspecting handsome, all american charmer charles brady(brian krause)to be someone entirely different from who he claims, gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into. charles lures pretty virgins into his arms, drawing their energy, in turn "feeding" his hungry mama, mary(alice krige). the fresh new target is tanya robertson(mädchen amick), and she seems to be easy pickens, but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle(..thanks to a deputy's cat, clovis), mary's vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way. mary, come hell or high water, will retrieve tanya in the goal of "refreshing" her dying son.like many teenagers, i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies. such as amy dolenz, i was smitten with mädchen amick. she's simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles, unaware of his ulterior motives. i just knew that mädchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen, but this would never be the case. too bad because i would've welcomed her in the genre with open arms.krige is yummy as the menacing, damn sexy, but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya's parents in one fail swoop, in less than ten or so minutes. she stabs one in the back with a corn cob! she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman, before cracking his arm(..a bone protruding), knocking him unconscious with his own elbow! she tosses tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face! a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles(cop-kebab!), falling on the pencil for extra impact. poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary, driven to the brady home, and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster! the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans. we see mary and charles' abilities to "dim" themselves and his car using a power of invisibility. writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers, joe dante and john landis as photograph experts.the film is shot in a tongue-in-cheek, let-it-all-hang-out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home. it's about the ultra-violence, simple as that, with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris' direction and king's screenplay. the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in-your-face. without a lick of complexity, this is closer in vein to king's own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works.

i sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. yes, there are vampire stereotypes. yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. even martial arts stereotypes. all well and good, and sure, not all perfectly done. however, i sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked...the cultural significance of its location. the film is set in pensacola, florida, and does not try to avoid saying so. that's a bold move in the film world today, and a rare treat for fans of indy films. and indeed, it may not be the last. pensacola is world renowned as a navy town, an aviation town, a lumber town, and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy. rarely is it seen as a growing film town. but that's all changing now. more film companies are coming in to shoot. and more native pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. this film is part of a growing trend of pensacola-based indy films, and more are on the way. pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and by and by, the world is taking more notice. watch and listen, world. the pensacolians are coming. like a virus.

as the maker of "this darkness," i admit we neglected 3 very important acknowledgments in our end credits. the omissions were over-sights that could not be corrected once committed, nor did the parties involved --- who saw the movie --- mention it at the time. on behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film, i extend them an apology. obviously, some criticisms posted here are harsh in light of their credit being accidentally. our production values were negligible and our "special effects" were quite special indeed, but the plot is very strong and the cinematography by john mcleod is superb. we hope you, the reader, enjoy "this darkness" and the efforts of those who worked their butts off for free. thank you, dylan o'leary, director.

yes, this is an ultra-low budget movie. so the acting isn't award winning material and at times the action is slow-paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie. this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops a full plot out of it. aside from the vampire story, we get detailed genetics info, legal and law enforcement, martial arts action, philosophical musings, and some good metal music. kudos go to dylan o'leary, the director/writer/main actor. it is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well. i think to appreciate this movie, you have to be well-versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things. there are some great camera work, too, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack- something i haven't seen before, but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in fulci's zombi. the casting is good, in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed. the main vampire also looks perfect for the role. the female victim looks vulnerable. my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick, there should have been more nudity. if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this flick is for you. i'm looking forward to seeing future projects by mr. o'leary.

the title says it all.i'm not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie.obviously this movie didn't have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great! it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie! i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd.i'll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films! dylan o'leary, cast and crew, i thank you!

i've seen a slew of "80s rocker horrors" over the years, from rubbish like "terror on tour" to ridiculously fun gems like "slumber party massacre 2." somehow i managed to keep putting this one off, which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well received one. well, i finally caught up with it and it's easily the best of this mostly awful (but almost always endearing!) subgenre. the plot (which was pretty much lifted in the film "black roses") concerns a mulleted misfit named eddie, whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music. he loves 80s metal, especially his idol sammi curr (played by the late great tony fields.) after sammi is killed, eddie favorite radio dj gives him sammi's final recording. once eddie plays the record backwards, he discovers he's a bit tougher, and bad things start happening to those who taunt him. is sammi's music possessed? "trick or treat" is well-made and a total hoot. the special effects are awesome, even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams. i grew up in the 80s, and while i wasn't a fan of heavy metal, i do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of satan worshipping. haha! i also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both kiss and ozzy worshipped satan, so it's very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio dj and a anti-rock priest. if only i had seen this film as a kid! while the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never really finds out why sammi curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way. this is movie's weakest point, but if you can overlook that, it's loads of fun.

this movie is horrible, but you have to see it because of that. i'm not here to discuss the entire film, just the greatest chase scene ever. when eddie dumbs milk on tim, he gets chased down the hallway. eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player; buy the dvd and watch it slow). the best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door. but when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics (mainly friction); yet what lies behind the door is supreme. the steepest stair case in any school ever, which this jock proceeds to clear in the air. in reality he probably would die of a broken neck. not only does he defy all concepts of reality, he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation. go and buy this one. trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks.

being a genre film fan, a child of the 80's and a fan of hard rock music...this movie holds a special place in my heart. it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar wailing glam- rock soundtrack. it certainly was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time. i didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here...but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a (sadly, mediocre) dvd release in 2002. if you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...but, trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...and, despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, trick or treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare. you'll never look at your stereo the same way again. or should i say mp3 player?trick or treat trivia- marc price (eddie) played geeky skippy handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'family ties.' after a string of direct to video flops including, 'little devils''killer tomatoes eat france' and 'the rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. recently, he has been considering a tv comeback.glen morgan (roger) is now a major hollywood producer/ screenwriter. he has written and produced several major films and tv series, including: 'space: above and beyond''the x-files''final destination''jet li's the one''willard' and most recently 'final destination 3'.tony fields (sammi) started his performing career as a dancer on the tv series 'solid gold'. he appeared in several low budget films and tv shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish sammi curr in 'trick or treat'. sadly, tony passed away on february 27th 1995 of aids related cancer.doug savant (tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething matt fielding on the popular sitcom 'melrose place'. since then he has had a long and varied acting career, appearing in such films and tv series as: 'the one''godzilla''csi: crime scene investigation' and the short lived joss whedon sci-fi series 'firefly'. currently he can be seen as tom scavo on the smash hit series 'desperate housewives'.

i gave this a 10 out of 10 points. i love it so much. i am a child of the 80s and totally into heavy metal for many years. those are the reasons i like this movie so much. its so cool to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy (judas priest, lizzy borden, raven, twisted sister...)and his vinyl collection(unveiling the wicked by exciter, rise of the mutants by shock metal master impaler and killing is my business by megadeth). also the soundtrack by fastway is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot. if you are into metal, then trick or treat is your friend. don't buy or watch this movie for ozzy or gene simmons because they are in the movie for seconds, watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory 80s. you will not be the same person after.

actually, i never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff, but this movie kind of played on that idea. though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high, it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing. the story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave. so yes, a bit of "nightmare on elm street" plot going on here. granted freddy never molested a girl in a car before. there was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy. this one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him. nothing to gruesome in it as i do not remember all that many gory kills. quite frankly, the scene i do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some creature incarnation of the band. nothing great, but a nice time filler.

sammi, curr a metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, the tried to censor his music!! (much like the real life dee snider, from twisted sister,[tipper gore] or ozzy osborne) killed in a fire, sammi cure was suppose to play on halloween at his old high school for a dance.. now eddie weinbauer , his #1 fan, and the only one who knew how sammi was, and what he felt (or did he?) nuke, the d.j. at the local radio station (gene simmons) has and gives the only copy of sammi's last record eddie.. but when eddie tries to play the record backwards, he finds sammi talking to him from the dead, and telling him what to do to get back at the bullies at his school that hate him and his music.. everything works out until, sammi starts to kill!! a great movie and must see for heavy metal hairband fans, with a great sound track by fastway, and just in case you don't know what the songs sound like or know fastway and doesn't like them, they changed there voice a bit and there style as well to sound like the more known cinderella, or ratt.. is the movie a true horror movie? well that depends on what you call a horror movie, to me a true horror movie is a slasher, with lots of killing, or just plain be scary.. this movie is neither, not enough deaths, but it can't be called a action, comedy, drama, suspense, or thriller, so that is why i would guess it has to be a horror.. so if you wanna "rock n' roll, rockin' on the mid night steel your soul!!" than sammi curr and trick or treat is the for you.. i mean "what are you afraid of? it's only rock 'n' roll!?!"

when you come across a gem of a movie like this, you realize why the '80s were the greatest decade to live thru. the rock music ruled, & so did movies...especially horror movies. filmmakers knew how to entertain us, & "trick or treat" is evident to this. when rocker sammi curr, who was most likely written after w.a.s.p. singer blackie lawless, dies in a hotel fire, his #1 fan eddie, is distraught. he goes to friend & local dj nuke (gene simmons) for support. nuke gives him a copy of the very last recording that sammi made; this is the only copy available. it was given to the radio station to be played live halloween night. when eddie plays it, it somehow brings back sammi. he helps eddie with the bullies at school, but then goes out of control. it is definitely one great movie. the bad thing is, this movie is out of print. i paid $25.00 to finally get it off of ebay. you should too...$$ well spent!

this movie is sort of a carrie meets heavy metal. it's about a highschool guy who gets picked on alot and he totally gets revenge with the help of a heavy metal ghost. it is such a classic. the soundtrack is a++++. you've got living legends of metal in it. and marc price was great in this film. this is a must have for metal fans.

i love this movie and never get tired of watching. the music in it is great. any true hard rock fan should see this movie and buy the soundtrack. with rockers like gene simmons and ozzy osbourne you can't go wrong.

skippy from family ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie. the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave (using skippy to help out). and while the plot is corny and cliche, the corniness (for example, an evil green fog taking off a girl's clothes)and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious (and great). and of course, there's nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song :). definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh. and while you're at it, make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2 - there's an "evil rocker" (as stated on the video box)driller killer in black leather w/fringe. a must see for cheesy movie fans.

nobody said movies had to be realistic did they? i really liked this movie because i remember when i first saw it in junior high. for all the kids who remember the pmrc and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.

this is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was. i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid. it doesn't help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown's graveyard when i was ten. turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan. so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile, but i love it now, as a 24 year old.i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover, but to my surprise, it ruled. it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd. this movie is awesome, if you love 80s metal and bad movies, this one's for you. 9/10!

i heard about this movie when watching vh1's "100 most metal moments." on the segment, gene simmons (who played a cameo) and several other interviewees discussed how utterly awful this movie is. unlike most people, i'm often more curious about checking out movies that have reputations for being ridiculously bad than, say, a masterpiece of cinema. the advantage of having that sort of attitude is half the time i find out that the movies are nowhere near as bad as people said, and i end up enjoying them a lot more than i initially expected. that was my experience with "trick or treat." now, it's hard to make a movie about a teenage boy who receives messages from a dead heavy metal star by playing one of his vintage records backwards without people scoffing at the premise. sure, it's certainly a strange premise, but one that's never been done before! give the filmmakers points for originality for pete's sake! if you're looking to buy the dvd, having no prior knowledge of the movie, don't be fooled into thinking ozzy osbourne and gene simmons are the stars. however, though simmons has a thankless role, ozzy does have a funny cameo as a reverend (that's right, a reverend!!) who speaks out against heavy metal. for one thing, it's funny seeing ozzy with short hair. and for another thing, you can't help but laugh at the irony. sure, it's a cheap shot, but an effective one. the acting is pretty good. i found the performances convincing. the teen characters are horribly clichéd. so expect the usual array of jocks and nerds. and like in every one of these movies, the pretty girl is a decent person who has sympathy for the alienated main character, yet continues to go out with her jock boyfriend. why's she going out with such a complete jerk in the first place? because the plot needs an obstacle. no other reason. but i can't deny that one of my guilty pleasures is watching the evil jocks in these movies go down, since i was an outcast in high school. the movie kept my interest for the most part, but the third act is way too conventional and caused me to roll my eyes as there would be one predictable situation after another. but altogether the film is not at all bad and definitely worth viewing on a rainy day. (7 out of 10)

every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it. i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by fastway.the movie itself was typical 80's, guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed.matt from melrose place picks on skippy from family ties so skippy gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose, the highlight being where tony sings (lip-synchs) and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fan.there were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10

trick or treat, quickie review this zany romp of a film revolves around the 80's culture of heavy metal and horror movies--two things which i love dearly. so, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. plus, for no apparent reason, ozzy osbourne plays a preacher.this film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of "evil" heavy metal. his favorite metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing his latest unreleased album backwards. this allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh*t helping out.okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? it's got a surprising number of good qualities. decent acting (including gene simmons as a radio dj), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere... all in all, it's actually a decent horror film. but what really sucks is the music. ironic, huh? well, this "uber-evil" metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, motley crue rejects on the planet--and the "metal" is little more than putrid 80's pop/hair metal. he hits all the cliché's here, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming "rock and roll!!!" in a pitch high enough to make king diamond retch. aside from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. 7/10www.residenthazard.com

teenager eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated due to his obsession with heavy metal music. one day he finds out his hero sammi curr has died, supposedly burned by the establishment which wanted to put a stop to his music. but eddie has his last record, never released, and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. before long sammi has revealed he intends to return to life at the local halloween party to exact revenge on the town which once mocked him.filled with humour and in-jokes, this is a highly entertaining film. sammi himself is an original horror movie villain, plays on the 'evils of rock music' obsessions of the 80's. well worth watching.

this is a true "80's movie": back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays, and that makes many of them quite interesting... it was a cultural phenomenon, that don't exist anymore. nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap "straight-to-video"-movies in the eighties, are doing cheap porn. porn seems to sell. anyway, this is above the medium trash-movie level: it has good&fascinating story, and it's quite well made i think. in one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture. of course there are also little cameos by ozzy and gene simmons, but they don't very much contribute to the film "success", although they are good in their small roles. the monster,heavy-singer "sammi curr", looks really terrible, especially when he's singing. one of the scariest monsters i've seen in horror flicks. i may have nightmares of him next night. not recommended for intellectual movie lovers.

undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin' 80's, which admittedly doesn't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub-genre like "hard rock zombies," "blood tracks," "terror on tour," and the especially ungodly jon-mikl thor-starring stinker "rock'n'roll nightmare" tended to be. that aside, this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f/x razzle-dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80's teen-targeted scarefest. moreover, the film's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self-righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil's music are very clever and on the money funny (famed greed decade heavy metal god ozzy osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti-metal tv evangelist!).marc price (the hopelessly dweeby skippy on "family ties") gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as eddie "ragman" weinbauer, a geeky, socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who's constantly picked on by the stuck-up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at lakeridge high school (the cruelty and mean-spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy). eddie's life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol sammi curr (an impressively whacked-out portrayal by tony fields) perishes in a hotel fire. hip local disc jockey nuke (kiss front-man gene simmons in a cool cameo) hooks eddie up with sammi's final, unreleased album, which when played backwards resurrects curr's malevolent spirit back from the dead. sammi encourages eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor eddie's life the proverbial living hell, only to have meek eddie prove to be a most reluctant would-be accomplice. it's up to eddie, assisted by token nice girl leslie graham (likeably essayed by the lovely lisa orgolini), to stop sammi before things get too out of hand.ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor charles martin smith (who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher), smartly written by michael s. murphy, joel soisson, and rhet topham, and capably acted by a uniformly up-to-snuff cast, this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty "jump" moments (an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long-tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight), a rousing "carrie"-style high school dance slaughter sequence, a neatly utilized halloween setting, revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business, and a solid central message that you shouldn't make a particular over-hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti-establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status.

first off, this really is my favorite film ever. i don't need to give anyone a description because every a**hole does that. i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless, cheesy, lame effects having', boom-stick showing', badly edited, 80's metal horror masterpiece. the director (i heard) had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy/jason type of deal for himself. damn, i wish that could've went down like that! the soundtrack's banging'. the acting's good....check this mofo out. and any die-hard fans out there, feel free to email and chat sometime. midgetorgy....i can be found at yahoo.

trick or treat is a fine example of hollywood jumping on the "backwards messages in metal music" bandwagon that tipper gore and her washington wives kick-started in the mid-'80s (other, less successful entries in this mini-genre include the awful black roses and silly the gate). i was a sophomore in high school when trick or treat came out and couldn't wait to see it. it seemed to disappear from video stores by the end of the '80s, but i finally picked up a budget-priced dvd copy a short while ago and it brought back many pleasant metal memories from back in the day. any teenage metal nerd could relate to the trials of eddie "ragman" weinbauer (marc price of "family ties")in this film as he is persecuted by the preppie "beautiful" people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and musical taste. eddie's favorite rock star is sammi curr (who looks a lot like tommy lee of motley crue), who is killed in a hotel fire early in the movie. eddie is inconsolable till he receives a test pressing of sammi's final, unreleased album from a radio dj (gene simmons of kiss in a brief cameo). eddie soon discovers that this lp, when played backwards, allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of sammi curr himself! soon sammi is giving eddie advice on how to get even with his preppie torturers but when the messages escalate in scariness ("waste'em all... no false metal!") eddie tries to destroy the album, which results in sammi coming back to life via eddie's stereo speakers. sammi rampages to the big dance at eddie's high school and takes the stage to rock the crowd and disintegrate a few unlucky "false metallers" before eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams. (sigh) no, it's not terribly scary in 2006, it wasn't even scary in 1986, but trick or treat is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metaller and has a kick-ass soundtrack courtesy of the cult band fastway. well worth seeking out if you've ever banged your head or have a taste for b-grade horror movies (or both, like me).

one of my favourite films. it has everything - rocking soundtrack, courtesy of eddie clark, ex motorhead, loads of action, loads of laughs, totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful '80's stereotypes as characters. eddie, the put-upon nice guy, who just wants to be left alone to be different, leslie (about as wet as they come), nuke (the rock burn-out), eddie's mom (pathetic), roger (the geek) and ozzy as the preacher (surely he exists in america?). then there are the boys (rich, vicious and stupid) and the girls (vacant, vain and stupid). what more could you ask for?well, first of all, there's sammi curr, the rock star, an amalgam of every '80's badass rocker you can think of. what about that rocket firing guitar? then there's the scene where sammi pulls the old lady through the tv screen and smashes her up. and what does roger do? why, hoover her up, just like a good geek would. my favourite scene is where tim hainey gets his long overdue reward from sammi via the wet finger in the plug - magic!if you were into rock in the '80's or just love ridiculous films like i do, then check this one out. it's available on dvd and very cheap so (trick or)treat yourself.

i first saw this film as a teenager. it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world. trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks. with a cast that features skippy from family ties, gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? backwards evil messages played on vinyl! yes thats right, they use records in this movie. in one scene eddie (skippy) is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary. monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed. as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine. almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies.

this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - it was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and the '80s saw plenty of them)! i saw this movie when it first came out, and instantly liked it. being a big fan of kiss, it was great to see gene in the movie. and anything with ozzy as a metal-hating preacher can't be all bad! also, fastway was already a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack.the original vhs (this was pre-dvd) cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" looking on. it was a special order, and the price for the vhs copy at the time (circa 1987) was $90! i really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. the 'ozzy-gene' cover was only created for the $5 re-release. the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they had better put 'em on the cover! same thing with the original "little shop of horrors" - jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star.i have a "trick or treat" web site, and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person! fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr'.all-in-all, it was just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. definitely not to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed!

god i love this movie. if you grew up in the 80's and love heavy metal, this is the movie for you. they really don't get much better than this. the fastway soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever. i put on the record when it first came out and spent the next month learning every song on guitar note for note. the plot outline is your standard heavy metal horror movie. kid's favorite singer dies. kid plays record backwards. hero comes back in demonic form and rocks the town. what more could you ask for?if you haven't seen it yet, rush out and buy it. you will not be disappointed. metal rules...

this film is the most cult movie on metal there is. premise: a kid gets a hold of the final recording of his favorite artist sammy curr who recently dies in a hotel fire. he plays it backwards and summons him back from the dead to get revenge in the name of heavy metal on those b**tardly jocks who torment him. any fan of true metal will enjoy this movie, and if you are a metal head being tormented by jocks, play a sammy curr album backwards.........no wait he is fictitious, well get a hold of this movie and watch it with your fist in the air, your head banging, and the volume at 11!

these two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good tv series, so let's compare.freddy - 7 movies robocop - 3 moviesfreddy - 1 tv series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes robocop - 1 tv series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodesfreddy - 2 extra films (freddy vs jason, freddy vs ghostbusters) robocop - 4 extra films (robocop: prime directives: dark justice, meltdown, crach & burn, resurrection)freddy - 1 upcoming film robocop - 1 upcoming filmwho's had more screen time? well they've both had 7 movies, 1 tv series, and 1 upcoming film. but freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) & 17-18 tv episodes.since this is a comment for the series, between freddy's nightmares - anoes: the series & robocop: the series i would personally choose robocop...

i'm a bit conflicted over this. the show is on one hand awful, the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like brad pitt and bill moseley in one episode), the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. there's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and robert englund's cameos are short, pointless and corny in a sort of a bob saget on america's funniest home videos kind of way.on the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. the 80s fashions, the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of the view at all times, the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares, so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his sat's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him, another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by brad pit), another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home, another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin, another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. the list goes on and on.being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices, but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. you have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it).if you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. if you're looking, on the other hand, for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. watch it.its been showing on chiller tv lately (pretty much every day) and i've been watching, earlier out of morbid curiosity, and now just so i can get a good laugh in each day. with arrested development and extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now.

i know technically this isn't the greatest tv show ever,i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it.the acting can at time be also a little crumby.but,i love this show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988.of course it would i was 5 years old.but i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodes,which unfortunately i hear is now deleted.and i also heard warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first dvd's bad sales.also the tv show didn't have the same feel as the movies,in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone.even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4(both that film and the tv show were made the same year),this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing,i like freddy as the clown wise cracker.but i think that was the strenght of this tv show,you didn't have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody.in fact this has more of a dream feel to it,reinforced by the soft focus of the lense.im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video. i love this show,and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable.much better than anything on tv today.

i don't see how you can say that freddy's nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off. you obviously don't know good tv when you see it. the episodes are packed with drama and blood. freddy is creative in the way he kills people. i love freddy's nightmares and i hope to get all 44 episodes on dvd. the best episodes are: saturday night special,school daze, and love stinks. if you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember it's only your opinion and it means nothing. freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll come to accept that fact soon enough. if you don't like it then don't watch it but don't deny it's brilliance.

this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right. friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies. poltergeist the legacy: i'm not so sure. it may have been loosely connected to the movies. it feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it.it shows freddy being burned by the elm street parents(in the 1st episode i believe) and the amount of parents were disappointing. with all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies, you'd expect there to be more parents. but oh well.freddy is basically the narrator for the show. he watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow. just like other anthology shows like tales from the crypt, there's a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved.the acting lacks but believe it or not: the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie. this show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie. i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents. i watched a lot of r rated stuff as a kid, so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the series , so it wasn't a total loss.

i still have grainy, late night, no-cable, cheap vhs dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when, late-night-commercials and all, when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on -- just so i could tape it.the series wasn't really about freddy kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod serling-esquire announcer. instead, each episode was a distinct nightmare, using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating, and... hmm... dating.from the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says "i will love you forever" to the wrong girl, and is stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together...), to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man, only to find herself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses, and one i only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey (and the injuries and penalties that go with it) - dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series.one episode had jeffrey combs (re-animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient. not original, but still creepy and fun....even so, some of the episodes were great. my personal favorite was "it's a miserable life" where a young man is trapped working in his parents' burger joint, when he wants to go off to college. stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same. no, not freddy, just a thug with a gun - turns out the whole mind-blowing episode is just that - the last thoughts that pass through the kid's head... along with a bullet.the second half of the same episode (many of the freddie's nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories) followed his girlfriend, who was also wounded, but not killed in the drive-by, and who is taken to "the hospital from heck" - they cram in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clichés, and then some - from accidentally having your mouth sewn shut - or waking up during an operation - to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the morgue for a little cuddle.again, that was my favorite.some of the episodes were much dumber, like almost all of the ones they've made available on video. they put the crummy ones out as representative of the series, and then nobody likes them, thinks the show stunk, and then they don't put any more on video. it's a miserable life is only available on pal dvd in england - but i'm still gonna buy it.

did you ever wonder how far one movie could go? schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with harry russo. harry is an aggravated writer, killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity. driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck, harry begins his killing spree. from director ron atkins comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever to be filmedthe only other movie i have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled schizophreniac necromaniacthis is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something disturbing, different and horrific then this would make a fine choice.do not expect anything like modern day horror (such as scream)viewer discretion is advised

this film is like marmite. you either love it or you hate it. if you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values, a good plot and great characters you'll hate it. if you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you'll probably hate it.if you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of harry russo you will love it. john giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane, murderous coke fiend.the special effects are abysmal at best but really, who cares? if you're the kind of person who's prepared to watch a film schizophreniac: the whore mangler you've undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore. with the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would've mediocre at best. i'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre.to sum it up, you'll probably hate this film but if you're one of the few who decide to see it anyway it'll become the best thing since sliced bread #2 i hate marmite.

all i can say about the necromaniac/schizophreniac 2 series is... if you are even remotely "pc" or don't have a seriously messed up sense of humor, then you probably wont get it. as sick and disgusting as this movie is, it really is a comedy and not a "horror" movie at all. if you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable, to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it's comical, then you must see this to believe it. this movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn't touch this with a 10 foot pole (with a condom on the end). in my opinion though, the best, most extreme pieces of art come from way underground. if you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it.i have seen stacks of terrible, boring, z-grade, indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good vhs tape or dvd-r. i have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars. when a no budget film like these two from ron atkins/john giancaspro come out and blow all of the other "shock" films completely out of the water, you really have to take a second look at the whole indy movie scene. after seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an indy film maker can have when they work on their own.the funny thing is, even the other people who saw this movie and "hated it" admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it. i don't think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two. so if don't take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously, and are able to laugh at a misanthropic, puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped, you have to see this. you may just be able to see it for the stand alone, cult classic that it is. both schizophreniac / schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds.

jack frost is really a cool movie. i mean....its funny. its violent. and very enjoyable. most people say that it is b rated, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. it has great special effects and good acting. the only weird thing is of course, the killer snowman. i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late-nineties. most films these days lack the criteria of a clive barker master piece. that is, be original and give the viewer what they do not expect. jack frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. grade: a+. ed also recommends the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost.

okay, but just plain dumb. not bad for a horror/comedy film. i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe (never seen it) the horror (possibly comedy) uncle sam, i'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21, the day before thanksgiving. worth the four bucks, l.o.l. at this film.9/10

as far as horror flicks go, this one is pretty darn good. while it may not be a classic tale of horror and suspense, it does provide many quality chuckles that make this movie a must see if you're into the horror/comedy genre.

how can someone not like this movie??? this movie is so good, that the first week i saw it on the shelf at the video store it was stolen....best horror movie ever!!!....i mean he took the carrot and he...well you know hahaha..how is that not funny? the only movie that comes close to touching this is bride of chucky and that was just great!!

this film is absolutely hilarious. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b-movie chemical accident. he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals. its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish. the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point. alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film. fantastic tacky fun

before i comment about this movie, you should realize that when i saw this movie, i expected the typical crap, horror, b-movie and just wanted to have fun. jack frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that i've seen in a long time. scott mcdonald is great as jack frost, in fact i think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance. mcdonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements. as soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people, though, you will find it hard not to laugh. the lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny. the fact that the rest of the cast completely over-acts just adds to stupidity of the film, but it's stupidity is it's genius. the scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in b-movie, horror film fashion. i truly hope there is a sequel and i'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it. of course it's only fun to watch the first few times and it's not exactly a good work of motion picture technology, but i just like to see snowmen kill people. i gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours.

this movie is goofy as hell! i think it was written as a serious film, but then when it came time to film, michael cooney said "hey, let's throw in some humor and spice it up!" the characters are actually slightly developed, too. oh, and the death sequences are the best. one thing i hate, though, was the hairdryer-weapons. what was that all about?

okay, here's what i think about jack frost. i looked at the morphing box for the vhs tape and i thought to myself, this looks interesting. i rent it and i take it home. boy was i right, it is interesting. they put serial killer's spirits in dreams, in walking corpses and inside every day machines. but this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. inside the body of a snowman. i liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape, the pot holder, the snow globe, etc. i like the actor who played jack, he put some fun into a killer really not seen since freddy krugger. that's right, i said it. freddy krugger. it's that level of "cool". i wish some of the puppet effects were better, the mouth movements could have matched better. but i chalk that up to a small budget. the cast does a great job, there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump. all and all, a great story, good effects, great dialog and a great cast. i give jack frost...9 stars

i saw jack frost for £4:00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good. for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover. the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing "i only axed you for a smoke" and "worlds most pi**ed off snow cone" how funny and camp is that? the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too "jack be nimble, jack be quick, jack gouged eyes with candle sticks". if you're looking for a for a b-movie comedy horror that's full of puns then check jack frost out. 10/10

jack frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death. on the way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides in collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman. being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman. jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him. jack now starts his rampage all over again killing people in a small town.i don't think jack frost has a chance of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick. just put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but just don't take it too seriously.

yes this a b- grade horror. but at least the producers, directors, and cast does not pretend this flick is manna from heaven. the plot is corny, a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is splashed with genetic acid turning him into a snow man. the snowman a.k.a. jack frost then goes on a murdering rampage to find the small town sheriff that finally arrested him. with a limited budget the crew had to make do with limited special effects, most of the money appears to spent on the snowman's costume. particullary difficult shots are managed by cartoons or pan away shots (shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details).  this is no kid's movie and should not be confused with disney movie of the same title. if you do not let your children watch pg-13 movies alone than parents should not let their kids watch this movie. this movie has two claims to fame. 1. the beatiful shannon elizabeth (american pie)did her first major movie role. the scene where jack frost attacks shannon elizabeth is worth watching a few times. 2. this movie has the worst snowman joke ever. the joke is so bad that the directors credit the joke teller in the credit list.

note that i did not say that it is better...just more enjoyable. the lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving.i was actually sort of surprised that this was not a troma movie, as it has all the troma trademarks, including spewing acidic liquids, wisecracks from the villain after every murder, a ridiculous bathtub rape scene (which is sort of hard to get upset about, since the rapist is a snowman), and dumb deputies.there's a lot to love: 1. a snowman, about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet, drives a police cruiser around town.2. even though it is supposed to be close to (or below) freezing, nobody's breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running.3. the snow reminds you more of flocking or styrofoam peanuts than actual snow.4. a teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered. she talks him into breaking into the sheriff's house, of all places, in order to get it on. but first, she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine.5. after teen-aged jake's head is cut off by a sled runner, his father argues with the sheriff about whether tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. the sheriff maintains that tommy wouldn't have been fighting with jake because jake "is at least two feet taller than tommy." at that moment, someone in the background chimes in, "not anymore!" 6. when the evil snowman finally starts to melt away, the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period. this is much better than tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. if i were an actor, i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point.all in all, a fun film. there's not really even that much blood.

surprisingly good. the acting was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music was cheesie fun, the plot was stupendously fun. this was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest. parts of the plot and quotes i found to be very creative. 7 out of 10. actually for what it was, it would deserve a 10 out of 10. you are not supposed to compare this to an arthouse film or to a bloody slasher film.

this is one of the funniest movies that i have seen this year. the people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted. it is a beautiful thing. there were a lot of quality one-liners. this movie blew uncle sam out of the water (it was made by tha same people, i think)

i'm glad that users (as of this date) who liked this movie are now coming forward. i don't understand the people who didn't like this movie - it seems like they were expecting a serious (?!?!?) treatment! c'mon, how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously? the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise, and they didn't try to deny it. the straight-faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny! yes, there are times where the low budget shows (such as that explosion scene), but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie! so if you like b-movies, and the goofy premise appeals to you, then you'll certainly like "jack frost".

easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time. i first saw this movie when i was around nine years of age, and i have to say that it scared the hell out of me. now that i'm all growed up, however, i see this movie for what it really is... a work of genius. everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people, even if they won't admit it. i have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen, so naturally, for a horror junkie such as myself, thismovie was a dream come true. some people say that this movie is silly, or otherwise void of any intelligence... it's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one-liners and cheap gore. i love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately) i will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart.

are we really making 'video nasties' again? in the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8mm, this is quite a ride. unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of paris, hamburg and amsterdam. i am however being rather churlish for the 'depraved' scenes, including everything from, hot wax, harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning, beheading and some. these scenes are immaculate and it's a pity bruno and his budget couldn't stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures.

nick and kelly are ready to be married but travis (kelly's dog) leads nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for kelly. richard burgi and susan walters play nick and kelly and make a good couple. nick loves to drink, smoke, and play pool with the fellas for fun but nick suddenly abstains from this type of fun. sex is the one thing that he loves because he wants a child. we find out that an alien race is dying and needs to interbreed with women from earth to save their population. it becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved. a fine film.

this picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of alien invaders taking over a town and many of its' men folk.the town and the players are all decked out in sort of 1950's style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it. some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature.all the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd rate to add to the amusement.these type of films often deserve a cult following:8/10.

i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out.since i had already seen the original, when i saw this on sci fi channel- i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi - i knew what it was within the first few minutes. since i like richard burgi as a character actor, i wanted to see how he would pull it off.the writers/producers etc, modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the "aliens" (they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help) using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90's. maybe it added a bit of polish to the film, or not.this film. film? this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place, although no resolution of the alien's problem.i sort of remember that in this remake, the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi/alien- i think it could have ended better. but the ending is just the ending, and the yarn is a swell yarn, being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock. many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film.this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something. i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi, this one came off well. i actually enjoyed this quite a bit.but if anyone really wants to see this story told well, i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott, directed by gene fowler jr.

using buster keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. he may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age. this gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story. he get hooked up with a guy living in modern times, and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times keaton is able to do his sight gags very well. i've heard his voice before. i believe he did some of those beach party films, playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks. serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way. it's not a bad story. it shows how one reacts when we wish for something we don't have and get that wish.

well now, this was certainly a surprise episode. in this anthology science fiction series, with all of this alien beings, extraordinary occurrences and many brushes with the hereafter, this episode would certainly rate as unusual. its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not imparting any morale at story's end. or does it? kicking off with the silent movie form, no recorded dialog, but having musical accompaniment. in this case it's on the sound track, not utilizing the playing of organ or piano by an on sight musician. this part of the episode, along with the ending section, also made liberal use o title cards, just like "the old time movies." while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone, they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film.veteran comedy film director, norman z. mcleod, was the man in the chair for this half-hour installment. he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time, featuring people like the marx brothers, w.c. fields, harold lloyd and danny kaye. he was no stranger to to tv, as he had done a lot of work on television series.it doesn't appear that he and mr. keaton had ever worked together before(as i cannot find any evidence of this)' but judging by the outcome of the film, they succeeded in doing so with flying colors! anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player. he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it. their short partnership must have been a harmonious one, with 'give and take' about how to do things. it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton's, resurrected from his own silent picture days. for example, the gag of putting the pair of pants on with rollo's(stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and roscoe "fatty" arbuckle in one of the arbuckle 2 reelers, the garage (1919). that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell.buster knew that we film our world with a camera, rendering it a two dimensional image. this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags. it is a cardinal rule for his film making.the cast was small and once again just chock full-of veteran talent. stanley adams was rollo and served as mr. keaton's straight man. jesse white, the old 'maytag repair man', ran the fix it shop that fixed the 'time hjelmet'. gil lamb, serene veteran of rko short comedy series, was the 1890's cop. james flavin, george e.stone, harry fleer, warren parker, and milton parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast.without spilling the beans, let's just say that yes, there is probably a lesson to be learned here. if not the one already mentioned, "the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence!", then how about, "be careful in what you ask for, because you just may get it!"

this is a clever episode of twilight zone that was comic rather than strange or tragic. buster keaton is woodrow mulligan, a janitor from 1890 america, works in a laboratory. he is constantly griping about the life problems around him: meat is too expensive (it's like $1.00 / lb. unheard of!). he is always yelling after crazy speeders (on bicycles - autos haven't appeared yet). griping to the end, he sees a helmet like device by a scientist, and puts it on and tries it. suddenly he is in modern america. the beginning was a seven minute silent film. now it is all noise, all talking, all beeping, all blowing. keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better. he runs into stanley adams, a professor rollo, who realizes that mulligan is from c. 1890 (he mentions president cleveland). rollo has always wanted to live in that charming, quiet age. he helps mulligan get the helmet repaired, and they go back in time. rollo gets bored after awhile, due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use. mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future. but now woodrow is fully content with the quiet, simple age he lives in. he has found contentment.in his last fifteen years buster keaton was frequently on television (many times for allan funt on candid camera, where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public). he did make a few films as well (most notably a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and the railrodder). but he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes. he is in his element here, presumably advising the director (old comedy film director norman mcleod - he directed the marx brothers in horse feathers) on the tricks he could do. watch how stanley adams and he time adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs. in terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the 20s in films like sherlock jr. the episode does show keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixties.the appearances of jesse white (here as a repairman, of all things) is always welcome. but look a bit at "professor rollo". stanley adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the 1950s onward to his tragic suicide in 1977. plump, with unkempt appearance, and heavy, booming voice, his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of requiem for a heavyweight (he wants anthony quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an indian). his best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the starship enterprise in star trek to those furry, fertile little creatures "tribbles" (as in "the trouble with"). adams was always worth watching (like jesse white, and certainly like keaton), enhancing most of the productions he appeared in. i have never understood his suicide, but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer.

buster absolutely shines in this episode, which is the only vehicle i've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical (and silent!) comedy that made him famous. it's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing i don't care for, as far as buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled. he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with roscoe arbuckle.my deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode, and for giving buster's genius full scope. he didn't have much time (one episode) to do it in, but this is a touching tribute to hollywood's greatest genius.

this episode of twilight zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic acting and sight gags, an homage to the early buster keaton films. lots of slapstick: buster falling on a bulkhead door, falling in a puddle, running around pants-less. silly scientist's invention of a time helmet, reminiscent of a flash gordon idea of what the future would be. cheap prices, like $1.95 for ladies hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to buster. even the world of 1890 is too much for buster/mulligan. how shocking when he is mistakenly transported to the "modern" world of 1960! buster was trying to go backwards! the "scientist" of that time wants to return to a calmer world, the 1890 that he has studied and admired. they go back together, and buster/mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. so buster sends him back with the crazy helmet.this twilight zone doesn't have a heavy message. since buster keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. that's enough.one other cute thing--longtime underutilized maytag man jesse white is a repairman who fixes the time helmet--foreshadowing his washing machine career.

to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didn't go into theaters,the deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used,there are a few dull moments when the story's following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday get's the props it should.the very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer,the property he buy's turns out to be where the witch(tooth fairy)lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger don't wanna give anything really away just a little info if you've wanted to see this movie then do so it's worth the price of the rental

i thought the children in the show did a very good job. i especially enjoyed the performance of the emma character. well done! the stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. i was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes.i enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her. the ghostly apparitions of the children's souls being released was also good. another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along. there wasn't a lot of slow scenes. the adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining. all in all an enjoyable night of movie watching.

i almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked. the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station.they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy. it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be. the make-up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one. it was a simple story with believable acting.it's not the scariest or goriest movie, but i wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it. on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out.

when i heard that this movie was coming out the night before halloween, i was very excited. when i found out that it was a book, written in 1978, i had to read it before seeing the movie. i'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book. the writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book, with minor differences, naturally. i think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was boyle playing the role of col. i'm not a big fan of boyle, and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie, she's always trying to use her over-plumped lips, and darkly makeup-ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy. indeed, i think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house. my favorite subplot was the sheehan family (which is so weird b/c the son was killed in iraq and in current events there is casey sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti-iraq tirade). in the book, obviously the war was not iraq, but rather, vietnam, and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter, i was truly creeped out. overall, i was impressed with the movie, in that it followed the book very well.

after too many years of waiting, anne rivers siddons' noted 1979 book "the house next door" has finally been filmed. the result veers a bit from the novel which, especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a tv film, the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good, just not as great as the book, one of stephen king's favorites and one of mine as well.with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release, all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured, especially the climactic revelation near the very end.still, the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence. there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed. actually, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next-door amateur-artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas.be sure to read the great novel.

an ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. or at least that is what lara flynn boyle's character, col kennedy, argues. after a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door, col knows something has got to give. mark-paul gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect.my opinion: the house next door works because of lara flynn boyle and the locations (beautiful house) and stylish sets. boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely stunning. she brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. without her, it would have failed. "it's so alive" declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house. yes, it is alive. but the story itself is not so much.barring boyle's presence, not much is happening here, as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. the results are predictable. but i liked it anyway. the cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on account of boyle, the premise of an evil ultra-modern house, the locations and cinematography, and set decoration and wardrobe.

i like ghost stories. good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. now i've see many of them. as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films, some times to find a real gem , you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. now this one, very rare , pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called " the new house " was one of the most scariest films i ever saw. it was on once in 1972,...i was only 9,..but nothing since then even compared to it. with all the remake going on in hollywood, some one should do this one " as is " with no more special efx than the original. this episode was down right creepy as hell. i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find. the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original " the haunting " and george c. scott in " the changling " . wish someone would do more ghost stories like these.

i grew up watching this series. i was about seven/eight years old when it was on. i still remember the 1st episode which was called "the new house." it scared the h*ll out of me! i can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly. and the ending, oh my god! the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: yikes! this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series. i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. my question to any readers: has anyone purchased this set? its a bootleg. both sellers claim to have very good copy. i have a sketchy and poor dvd of "the new house" episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids. a great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural. thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- in fact, i'd love to discuss it. chris walker

ghost story,(the new house) is a terrific horror story. this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventies.the beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot. remember him from the early family series, family affair in the 1960s? this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors, and as the main characters in the story.i saw this recently,and i was so scared!if you are alone,i would not recommend that you watch this.this story is terrific,no gore or curse words, but very scary. barbara parkins played the young bride. david birney played her husband.both actors were very good in their parts.if you like scary, fun,terrifying ghost stories, then you will like this little gem. i gave this a high rating.i highly recommend this story.

ghost story (the tv movie--1972) was the pilot for the nbc series. the movie was well-written and well-acted and, i thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, if the tv series is half as good as the movie, then nbc has a winner. (i wish this film was available on video!!) the series was a colossal disappointment--even with william castle as exec. producer. if, however,you have a chance to see the original tv movie, ghost story, check it out. you won't be disappointed.

this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000, but when i see this film, i don't think about that wonderful tv series. i believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick, with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf(angelo rossitto from 1932's freaks). i also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch. my only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. i don't want to spoil any of this film, so go out and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.

bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940's and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones.bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young. after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.you have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in bela's house. bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.the corpse vanishes is worth a look, especially for bela lugosi fans. great fun.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

this is an excellent movie. the cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. the movie is basically about a well-accomplished doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home. once the bodies are at his home, he removes stuff (i hate to use such a general term, but i forget what it was he removed) and puts it into his wife to retain her youth. then a reporter, patricia hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying. she takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place. definitely watch this oldie, but goodie if you can.

i wouldn't say this is a bad movie; in fact it's pretty typical of the type of film that the "poverty row" studios were releasing at the time. filmed for monogram, bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community. in this movie, bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides, and, after their demise, injecting bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young. lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film, however, the movie suffers from the ultra-wooden acting of co stars luana walters and tristram coffin. coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case. i've seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and utterly unconvincing. miss walters is only slightly better, but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable. still, the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end! despite the poor acting by some, "the corpse vanishes" is an enjoyable movie for all to see.

this is not bela lagosi's best movie, but it's got a good old style approach for some 40's horror entertainment.brides are dropping dead at the altar like flies. i think i'd postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught, but it's a horror movie, so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason. anyway, lagosi is a mad doctor, who needs young female blood to keep his aging, sickly wife healthy and happy. he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse (who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse?), and the brides just keep on getting zapped.no movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own. good at solving crime, bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times, guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim. i love the "haunted house" bit where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosi's sinister mansion. hidden passageways, a vampire-like wife, an evil dwarf igor assistant, and so on. good stuff.fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving, and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner. if you like old horror movies, this one is worth a watch.

bela made 9 pics for monogram, but it was only at this one, the 4th, that things started to come together. all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production, writing and character development. from here on, better or worse, the series would also deal with one essential theme: a scientist (usually bela) makes experiments in the basement or the old house (sometimes in the basement in the old house) that causes things to go blooey. this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings. he came on board for black dragons, the flick before, but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click. lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing, and was around for all the rest of the monograms. casting is key in these, and it's a pretty good one b movie wise, here. you get barclay and harlen (also from black dragons),along with russell, who would star in lewtons' cat people movies..and rosetto, from spooks run wild...a nice slice of poverty row talent. if you have limited time and budget, start with this one...it sums up everything they had learned up to this point, and gives you something to compare the rest to. the plot? bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young. they both like to sleep in coffins. if you can read that and smile, the rest will be easy.

rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes, a renfield-like assistant and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (sounds like a greenaway movie actually lol). lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides (why them? who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. he gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar. after another bride bites the dust, a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop, and decides to snoop around for a story. she gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and lugosi. heaven knows where the police were. soon she's off to bela's lair, when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. it all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist, but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision, as he foils her plans, oh no! what will happen? i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. lugosi is great here, his hangers-on are all very very strange, the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable. a fun little view.

i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies. price portrays don gallico, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor). even though price is a murderer, i actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him.although this movie doesn't have the "horror" factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, "house of wax") it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest. this is a must for vincent price fans.

to die for has it all.this film has a great cast. lots and lots of romance and terror. not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans. there are a lot more vampire love stories. if you are a fan of vampire love stories i strongly recommend this film-10/10.

small spoilers alert !!!good movie...very good movie. and i'm surprised to say that myself, because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news. most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen. this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action. this movie really fascinated me. good accomplishment, seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved. it really is the story that keeps you focused. especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied. sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth. it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle. of course, that's where the reality and the "based on a true story" stops. the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker.in this movie, the count ( vlad teppish) emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman. and they're all pretty girls, i'll give him that. overall, good acting by unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore. but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr. heck, it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title. these two films have nothing else in common, but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture. check it out...my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10

what a gem of a movie, so good that they made a sequel.the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other.bendan hughes plays the eccentric vlad, a bit of an inkling there to who this character is, who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house.hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format.the movie is watchable, but the actors' performances are very wooden and they seem as they don't want to be in this film, but may be that's just all part of the decadent ambiance.didn't like the ending, but there is a sequel, must track it down.when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes didn't really fit the part. later on, i couldn't stop thinking about him, he sort of exudes an eerie sensuality, so maybe he was right for the part.brendan hughes last seen in 'hitler - the rise of evil' as lt. guffman.where is he now?

when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of "the lost boys"(1987).to my surprise "to die for" is a really good movie.it's a little bit corny at times,but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts.this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times.highly recommended.

when i rented this movie i thought i was going to see a horror-movie. however, there is little horror in this typical seventies mystery-drama directed by strange james t. flocker. nice-looking matt boston carries the picture with his fine performance and the typical strange atmosphere of flocker's movies is all-present.

this is a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient hohokam indians. she takes a (really fake looking) mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it. well, pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy. and shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the woman's family. this is actually really boring, overall, and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it. but if you keep at it, you may just make it to the end. ahah! what is the secret of the mummy? is the mummy's spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave? you may not be able to ascertain what the spirit's motivation is, but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low-budget (and 70's hairstyles!) this will have a certain comforting appeal.the way i have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled, boring way the film lays the story out. can a boring movie really be fascinating? well...somehow this one achieves that. maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way. i don't know. what i do know is that i enjoyed it quite a bit, despite its dullness.fans of "spider baby" will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one (including an instrumental version of the theme song).featuring one frightening and fairly well-done sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper. other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky; but this one scene is actually pretty scary.see this! it's weird and it's worth your time. you might even want one on your shelf.

ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, especially when you see it as a child. seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit it isn't really all that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes (especially the ones with the creepy mummy)one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv; the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary. also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother's secret is pretty frightening.okay, the acting in the film isn't all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring, but overall ghosts that still walk is fun. too bad only a few people saw this film, this film really deserves better. i just wanna say: mr. flocker, you've done a good job! and for all you hollywood producers out there; if you want to remake a movie, remake this one!

my grandmother bought me this film when i was 5 (i've always love scary movies) and even then i enjoyed it. the atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining. i especially love the scenes where the rv is under attack in the desert. the rocks are actually convincing for such a low-budget flick. the acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie. this is definitely an uder-rated gem. i recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies, early eighties such as "alice, sweet alice", "poor pretty eddie", "nightmare", "hospital massacre", and "return of the aliens, the deadly spawn". definitely a classic!!

of watching this as a child. although i'll probably find it god-awful now, it was kind-of spooky stuff as i was only seven or so. i also recall working on a saturday-afternoon puzzle while watching it, so i wasn't really paying much attention. however, the scene with the rolling boulders has been burnt into my mind ever since. i've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail. 12 years ago, one person mentioned that, possibly, he had seen it, but he thought it merely a dream; a fanciful piffle like wind. it's no dream, my friend. no dreaming now. again, i haven't seen it since then, but i can't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr. anything that can stay embedded in my mind's eye for 23 years deserves a '10'.

i first saw this movie on a local station on the sunday afternoon horror show back around 1969 or 1970. uncut. i was just a little kid at the time, but i loved it and wasn't really that scared by it. i thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline. thinking back, i'm still surprised that it was shown during the day on t.v. uncut in those years. i've sought out this film ever since, seen it over and over again, and always loved it. one would think john waters would have idolized this film. it's got to be not only a scary film, but one of the sleaziest, trashiest films ever made at that time. and surprisingly, you don't hear about this one as having the cult following that a movie such as "blood feast" or "the hills have eyes" have acquired over the years. it has a cult following, but it should have really become a cult classic, in my opinion. as far as i know, this came out a little before blood feast came out, making this probably one of the first true "gore" films. in fact, this movie has elements of hershell gordon lewis and a little russ meyer thrown in for good measure.anyway, i recommend this for anyone who likes trashy, sleazy, black and white horror films from the early '60's (i think the date at the end of it read 1960).

this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released. there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date. however, i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on dvd. actually, i do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common. therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd. firstly, there was a theory about how naives our generation was. secondly, i think there is something more. i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers, specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre. this is the mutilation, the idea which gives coherence to the film; the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture. i remember how sick the sensation was, when the monster rip kurt's arm out. and at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes, no matter if the action is on a secret lab, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a striper dressing room, and so on. may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things. for example, in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fiancée's head a more accurate work, made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting. same thing with all action scenes, including the one of kurt's arm. furthermore, something could be done with the monster's make up. some remakes have been good; i think in this case an attempt would worth while. nevertheless, the black and white tones should be conserved.

i love buying those cheap, lousy dvd's from alpha video. one day, i happened to buy this one. it's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50's, all sexed up. replete with unscientific everything, scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama, it's an enjoyable film, to those who appreciate this kind of stuff. and if you can 'suspend your disbelief' enough, you can actually get creeped out-- not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet, but toward the end, with the character of 'the perfect body'. it's so . . . . what's another word for mindf***ing?

when i was young i had seen very few movies. my parents in all their wisdom rented this one. i was very wary of what the movie was about, in fact i wasn't even allowed to watch it. my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry. so what did i do? late at night i trashed the vcr! kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals. i was arrested of course, i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived. i was only given a stern talking to and sent home. my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr. this tore me apart, slave labour really sucks believe me, but i had to do it. chores all around the house. what happened in the end? we got a big screen tv, dvd player and a surround sound system for my work. how did i get the money? easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney! do you remember finding neno? well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks! they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done! in the end i never saw the film the head that didn't die and the rating i gave it is my life rating! it's doing pretty good!

this movie scared heck out of me when i was just a kid. it's no "citizen kane" but it has its moments. the arm ripping scene is good. the plot is good even if characters aren't - could have something to do with the acting. put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get. this was one of those shoot, edit (what little there was) and distribute in a couple of months type of movies. this is classic low budget sci-fi and deserves it just due. i rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age.

i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. first off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. the acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(herb evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(leslie daniels as the assistant kurt)to first-rate with virginia leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk. issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. this film is a thinking film in many ways. however, don't be too fooled by its real intent. it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. one other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.

the brain that wouldn't die was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962. today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959; the thing is both lurid and lewd, but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way.the story, of course, concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs--and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab. with the aid of a few telephone cords, a couple of clamps, and what looks very like a shallow baking pan, he brings her head back to life. but is she grateful? not hardly. in fact, she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing, particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body.as it happens, the doctor is picky about this new body: he wants one built for speed, and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks, haunting strip joints, visiting body beautiful contests, and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow. but back at the lab, the head has developed a chemically-induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments, this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet. can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance, wreck revenge upon the doctor, and save the woman whose body he hankers for? could be! leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly; virginia leith, the unhappy head, screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords. busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music, actors make irrational character changes from line to line, the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot, and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs. on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie.director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip, and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors, who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it. the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost, but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release, and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with.now, this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious, depending on your point of view, so it is very hard to give a recommendation. but i'll say this: if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers, you need to snap this one up and now! four stars for its cheesy-bizarreness alone! gft, amazon reviewer

this film is an absolute classic for camp. that is why it was an elvira and mst3000 classic. everyone knows the story. scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks. finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced chick's head on top. the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant's remaining "good" arm (his other is not right from a scientist's earlier failure), and the whole place burns down.the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing it. as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four. only one of those scary movies was really any good (the original "the haunting".)i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers. its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies (complete with porno sound track) scares the hell out of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing. i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i'd rather go to the dentist than watch "chicago" again.seven is the most i can give it, because its entertainment value is mere luck. the film , as cinema, is a disaster.

this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw...i was about 5 at the time. it scared me good! but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster...and my mom got very upset. she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint! now that's a movie! hey for it's time it was a great movie. that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then. and if your 5 it is very scary! kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination. your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects! (imo)

i truly enjoyed this film. the acting was terrific as was the plot. jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for. the only part of this flick i would change was the ending. the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel.there were some interesting religious messages in this film. jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature (or shark if you prefer) represented the anti-chirst. there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that 'end of the world feel'. i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature. i know many people won't get the references to christianity, but if you watch close you'll get it.

this is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man type critter on an uncharted island, then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them! lots of bad gci, goofy plot elements, and babes sweating in tight t-shirts follow.these monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this one spices things up with a bit of humor (i guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek), not to mention the sexy babes. but let's mention those sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight t-shirts, sweating profusely. one's in her undies at the beginning, another at the end. thank you, thank you, makers of bad movies! the plot is full of goofy stuff, a guy drives up in a jeep, slams it right into a tree, then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter. yeah, um, well, how 'bout we think about that for a while; we'll get back to you. the sharkman is hilarious - either awful cgi or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit. the mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; he's evil, that's his motivation, he makes no apologies.overall, if you want a stupid, fun b-movie, this one should do the job.

poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... awesome. the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. haha. good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. i highly enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a good laugh. i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious. i can not, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. however, if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy, i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. very simply. so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. it brought some joy into my life.

this is essentially a variation on house of wax ,in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies ,vincent price.in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other,less talented and less scrupulous people .in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist ,the great rinaldo (john emery)insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs.price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi. he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer.price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy.the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease .good solid b movie melodrama , this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece .shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance

like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title, michael oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous. the producer's last outing, "mosquitoman-3d" had the same problem. it's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it. the only draw for hammerhead: shark frenzy was it's passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface. but even that was only passable. poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish. with dolphins and whales, the technology is all but wasted. cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imax's stunning 3d capabilities. there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety. close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth. michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got shark-week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.

when i heard about "hammerhead" being released on dvd and finally found it at my local dvd store, i thought "well, just another cheap monster movie from nu image". those guys around boaz davidson and avi lerner produced cheap but very entertaining b - pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies. so i didn't expect much, especially after having watched the rather disappointing "shark zone" just a few days before. but "hammerhead" turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies. we have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, man-eating plants and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. everything you need for an entertaining monster movie. the only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie was made for tv it's understandable why these scenes are missing. and it doesn't matter anyway cause "hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment at it's best. there are two reasons why i gave it seven out of ten points, though: first of all, the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and secondly, william forsythe just isn't the right guy for the "hero" part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter tylo. other than that, i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there. grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. jasper p. morgan

as of this writing john carpenter's 'halloween' is nearing it's 30th anniversary. it has since spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those 'top 10 scariest movies' lists it's always on there. that's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $300,000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent. i could go on and on, but the big question here is: how does the film hold up today? and all i can say to that is, fantastically! pros: a simple, but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood. an unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director/co-writer john carpenter and alan howarth. great cinematography. stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high, gets some great shots, and is careful not to show too much of his villain. good performances from the then mostly unknown cast. a good sense of humor. michael myers is one scary, evil guy. a lot of eerie moments that'll stay with you. the pace is slow, but steady and never drags. unlike most other slasher films, this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count.cons: probably not nearly as scary now as it was then. many of the goofs really stand out. final thoughts: i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series. i know that's not a popular opinion, but it's really how i feel. despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs. and just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten. no way, no how.my rating: 5/5

i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. being made almost 30 years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame. boy was i wrong. there are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine. even the acting was great, jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald pleasance was superb.on the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it. it makes all the copycats, e.g. nightmare on elm street, scream look very tame. i can't really say it is carpenter's best because i have not seen many of his, the only one i can remember of his is starman (i think he made it). halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre.

every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening, though they usually aren't. most modern horror movies fit into this category.then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual. they actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced."halloween" is such a film. it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. but nearly all of them work. "halloween" is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole.the story is simple. laurie strode (jamie lee curtis) is babysitting some kids on halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. of course, the madman, later known as michael myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually he comes after laurie.sounds familiar, right? just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. not a chance.i think james berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of "halloween:" "because of its title, halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. however, while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member..." he has a point, and for a number of reasons. first and foremost, it's downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most of those fail as well). second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and he relies very little on it (actually, the body count is pretty low). in fact, one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie, at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. he relies on ideas for scares, and also skill. third, while some of the characters may do stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don't do them because they're dumb. the characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots, we're frightened because they're making a mistake.one of the main reasons why "halloween" is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real. nothing is hard to swallow in this film. there's no supernatural, there's no ridiculously creative plot elements, or "inventive" murders, or whatnot. instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action. what we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. it's a hit or miss game, which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has (which i'm not), they'd seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be. this is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. the actors act like real people, not characters from a story. nothing more. the exception to this is whoever plays the shape, or later known as michael myers. it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill, but it's hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). but the guy pulls it off, and the result is terrifying.this is carpenter's movie through and through. he directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score of it. this is a man of brilliance, and his later movie "the thing" supports this statement, though the thing is not as scary as "halloween." unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers "recognize your potential." as good as this film is, it's not without flaws. the famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. it's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear "the shape." luckily, carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. while there's no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. we grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. but once the film gets to halloween night, that's when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the end.while "halloween" may be flawed, it is only slightly so. it is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!

in 1978 a phenomenon began. the release of john carpenter's "halloween" got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is michael meyers. the critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated, and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history.plot: 15 years after a murder took place, four friends (all females) are babysitting(and having it on with their boyfriends) on halloween night. after escaping from a hospital the night before, michael myers returns to his home town to stalk these people. he murders 3 of them silently and subtlety. he does not speak. he walks slowly. he hides....only one of the friends escapes, after being saved by doctor loomis (michael's pursuer and doctor) there is one reason why halloween works so well. simplicity. we don't know where michael is, we don't know why he kills, and he frightens us. they're the only reasons why we are afraid.john carpenter wrote the movie, and directed. he builds unbearable tension throughout the story, and scares to such a degree, that sometimes we cannot watch. and the climax is truly startling.as horror, this is essential. it is terrifying and well acted. it is also mysterious. michael is a force, not a human. a force that cannot be denied.the sequels focused too much around michael and his "history". this movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece.

there are two movie experiences i will always cherish. the first was seeing "star wars" for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother. a close second is sneaking into halloween at the tripple plex with my good friend, trevor, in late october 1978. halloween left me breathless, speechless, and downright scared. everyone knows the story. young michael myers decides to kill his sister on halloween 1963. he escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to haddofield to wreck havoc once again. he spots laurie (jamie lee curtis), a shy senior who enjoys babysitting, and begins stalking her. her partying friends across the street are killed, one-by-one as michael sets his plot to get her. ironically, the young boy she tends on halloween is afraid of the "boogeman," and can see him outside. during the murder spree, dr. sam loomis (donald pleasance) works hard to find michael before he unleashes his fury. he has no proof, no evidence, just a hunch he has to sell to sheriff bracket (charles cyphers). as the plot unfolds, you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare. alfred hitchcock once said, "you can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off. that is a cheap thrill. however, put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off, then you have suspense." director john carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in halloween. the audience will see glimpses of him outside, watching, stalking his victims. we gasp. will he kill her? when will he kill her? then, michael disappears. carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore. this movie has little blood, but still provides good scares. one of the best scenes is michael lifting bob off the ground. he rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight, then he drives it. all you hear is a loud thud, then the audience sees bob's feet drop lifelessly. carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer. this also peaks our audience. what will he do? what's going on inside his mind? finally, carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension. moreover, the tandem screen writing he did with debra hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about. the teens are not "party mad," but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland. finally, there is some decent acting in this "b," low-budget thriller. nick castle who plays "the shape" (michael) adds something to the mindless killer. it is cold, merciless, and without any pathology. moreover, the personality does everything the same way. he kills only when trapped, or to set up a trap. he splits the victims apart. he also relies on brute strength. and that mask used (a bleached william shatner mask) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion. while pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues, he comes across as someone scared, desperate, and determined. it made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil. the crown jewel, though, is jamie lee curtis' debut. she plays the laurie character as someone scared, but also determined and strong who fights back. the end is one that left me speechless. this was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped. movies like star wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times. halloween, and other scary movies, though, do not have that advantage. so if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new, halloween would be the movie i would choose.

it was "the night he came home," warned the posters for john carpenter's career-making horror classic. set in a small american town, halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode, and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways...leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael. this plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs throughout the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. the difference between them, and this, is, quite simply, that "halloween" is the best.made on a very modest, tight budget...halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of "sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a knife/axe/chainsaw/ wielding psycho".

with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. john carpenter brings to life a nail-biting nightmare on halloween night, when laurie strode (jamie lee curtis in her debut, career defining role) and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun- only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell. michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum...having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in haddonfield, the sleepy illinois town where his murder took place. once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk and terrorize her, turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her.beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary... with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself. myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion.although "halloween" is certainly outdated, it is by no means less chilling. the idea alone is goose bump inducing, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day... it spawned seven sequels and eventually rob zombie's equally scary remake, and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today.

as i mentioned previously, john carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic conan the barbarian). it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers, whom i eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep. now that is terror for a 10 year old.it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves. the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works, perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious. this all could happen. it isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country (as most modern horror is, i.e. hostel, touristas, cry wolf, saw,etc). at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations. i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head. it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create. so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety.carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday, middle class, suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister. he then spends the next 15 years in an institution (which we thankfully do not experience) only to escape and return to his hometown, the infamous haddonfield. on his way he kills and kills. the child's name is michael meyers, though he is not a person. john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia. in the bastion of american safety and security, chaos can still strike.michael ceased to be a person once he killed. he is not a serial killer, human being or psychopath. he is as unstoppable force. the generic overalls, bleached-white shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete michael's generification. this is the source of all his power. he is faceless, speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos. this is helped by the cinematography (post card effect), a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence (dr. loomis). his over the top performance and uneasiness sells "the shape". this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode, the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds (at least for a little bit). though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films (black christmas came out 4 years earlier), it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing. if you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time (like me), this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack. i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter's career.

there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside.i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about.also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do.this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly, especially around halloween time.john carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween.oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don't.it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the 1978 john carpenter version better.michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film, and is a very well known one.so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.

halloween is a film i have to get out and watch every time it's that day of the year.i even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday!!!this film is so great.jamie lee curtis is an actress i can never stop loving.this movie might be old,but the story line still gets me right there every time,and the acting was absolutely fantastic!!!although i have not seen the remake,i feel already that it was totally unnecessary.i think rob zombie should have never remade such a classic.what kills me though,is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original.i am getting furious just thinking about it!!!!!!this movie was great,and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.

it took me time to really appreciate john carpenter's halloween. as a kid, i remember i really enjoyed the sequels, especially the return of michael myers, which i still think is the best halloween sequel. but i thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the point­. i watched it a couple of times recently and i know now i was wrong. today i truly understand this film, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. it's not about blood and gore. it's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. it's about the worst night in laurie strode's short life. it's about the night his demented brother comes back home to finish what he started 15 years ago. this movie is meant to be scary and i think it succeeds very well. it's also one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-genre that i always loved. halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors, such as jamie lee curtis in her first role. need i say more? anyone who's never seen it, horror fan or not, should do his cinematic homework right now. very highly recommended!

some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films. often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not the scariest.i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). i honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one, that's just how it worked out. but i would have to say this one blows all the others away. it is genuinely frightening, and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine. my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy, and leans his head to one side. it is one of the eeriest images in movie history.later slashers, such as the friday the 13th films, were more fun and less intense than this movie. i do like the f13 series better than the halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the f13 movies. michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people. i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights.what's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. it is just pure terror. it's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.

the first time i saw this movie, i fell in love with it. the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. i expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :p). the fact that i couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book. predictable horror movies bore me. now, i know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. finally, as i mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. it's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores, so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake. speaking of the remake, i read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that i know that mr. zombie reveres john carpenter, i have high hopes for his take on this classic. this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an all hallow's eve movie marathon. :)

classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director carpenter and star curtis.seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on halloween.halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! the direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. highest kudos also go to carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. in a sense, halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!the cast is excellent. young jamie lee curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter laurie strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. the great donald pleasants does a perfect performance as a myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. supporting cast loomis, soles, castle, and others are good too.so like its own villain, halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. it is a must for all genre fans!**** out of ****

this film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. the claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! actors are fantastic, rip donald pleasance you were fantastic as dr loomis, he made the film even better. without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. jamie lee curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. she gives a tremendous performance. i loved this film since it scared me like hell back when i seen it in the very early 80's and i still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! the fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. we all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. death at any turn. halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. it's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. as well as psycho's superb storyline, both of which i adore, i believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. to me halloween and psycho are the best films i have ever seen and i will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.

this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up, but had never seen it until a few years ago. it's reputation truly proceeded it. i knew of michael myers, had seen the mask, saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed. but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the halloween franchise. boy, how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs.halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie. now, by today's standards, it isn't as graphic and visceral, but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today. the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a quaint, mid-west town is a testament to his ability. the lighting effects are down right horrifying, with "the shape" seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will. the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense.the performances by all the players are well done, with specific nods to jamie lee curtis and donald pleasance. ms. curtis is such a good laurie strode because she is so likable and vulnerable. it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her, we want her to survive and get away.donald pleasance plays dr. loomis like a man on a mission, and it works well. he adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets.overall, not only is halloween a great horror movie, but also a great film. it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up. this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie. and for an even more frightful time, try watching it alone with the lights off. don't be surprised if you think you see "the shape" lurking around in the shadows!

john carpenter's halloweenis it the greatest horror film of all time? no .. maybe not to everyone, but to me it is and always will be. the film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart. it's unfortunate i didn't get to see this film until twenty years after it's release, but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then. my father suggested before i go see halloween h20 that i whip out and rent halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after watching halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the slasher genre.the film's plot is simple, in 1963 michael audrey myers killed his sister judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. incarcerated for fifteen years where he was treated by dr. sam loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls: laurie strode an innocent bookworm, annie brackett a tough talking sarcastic and lynda van der klok a beautiful and sexually vigorous young girl. dr. loomis tracks michael here where he enlists the help of the town sheriff leigh brackett whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one, until only sweet innocent laurie is left who is the prime target on michael's list.the casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances, jamie lee curtis was stunning in her first film role as laurie strode and donald pleasance gave a thrilling performance with his small role as loomis. nick castle who portrays michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer, and his walk and body movements were perfect.one of the great highlights of this film is it's chilling score done by john carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. the blue lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young laurie is cowering against a wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadows behind her michael's face materializes before he strikes. michael's mask was one of the thing's that sent chills down my spine the most, the white emotionless face worked perfectly.what makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy friday the 13th films, in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension. it became so clear that halloween spawned movies like friday the 13th and characters like jason voorhees, whom he is a mere rip off of michael myers.to sum it up, i suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time.

halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. he takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. this is just the start of things to come from michael myers.donald pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying myers for years. he knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. this evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.after an escape from an institution, myers tracks down his younger sister. if he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.there have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. but this one started it all, sort of. if you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls. well, if it wasn't for halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.halloween's director, john carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.this film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. it's been copied from and ripped off of, but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. it still gives you chills listening to carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers.

i must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. the unique way that john carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. the sound, the menacing horror of michael meyers and the infamous scream of jamie lee curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. i love the music, i love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. there is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of michael's true nature. is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? that question may never be truly answered, but carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.john carpenter is the master of horror. while lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see ghosts of mars), halloween began his powerhouse of a career. this is his ultimate film. while he did release other greats, i will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. with the power of his camera, he places these images of meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. i loved every scene in which we panned back and there was michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. that was scary, yet utterly brilliant. i loved the scenes in which carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. there you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where carpenter gets you, it isn't. michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. this leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.then, if you just didn't have enough of michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, carpenter adds that chilling theme music. i still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if meyers is looking at me through the window. carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. it is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's horror hollywood could muster. carpenter's halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by paris hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.finally, i would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. the use of the "clown" mask sent shivers up my spine. the way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! it completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. you have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of carpenter all rolled into one. i could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead i would rather go watch it again. it is worth the repeat visit many times! overall, i think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight carpenter and the slasher film genre. this singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. the lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of jamie lee curtis is exactly what makes halloween that film above the rest. sure, freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for jason, but michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. what can be better? grade: ***** out of *****

halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. it's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. it is a simple movie told very well. the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... if you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. the cast is all terrific. i wish they had never made sequel after sequel. the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie. she hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!

halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! it is in my opinion, the scariest movie of all time. michael myers is the best boogeyman ever! he was just so terrifying! what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a one note score, yet managed to scare the hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78.it's about a boy michael myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. dr. sam loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes michael as "...pure evil. the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes". michael is on a mission though, to kill his other sister, laurie, played by a new jamie lee curtis. she has to babysit on halloween, while her friends are out partying and of course, we know the rules, they get it! but laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;d halloween pays many homages to psycho, we have another character named sam loomis and jamie lee curis, the daughter of janet leigh. halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights! "they're gonna get you! they're gonna get you!". halloween, the ultimate horror film! 10/10

brutal, emotionless michael myers stabs his sister to death at age six on halloween night in 1963; on october 30, 1978, he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of haddonfield, illinois. he is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist (donald pleasence) who knows just how evil this young man is.it opens with a bang, and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire. it's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were; subtle, and scary. it retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings. how many movies are there, really, that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before? not very many.pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; jamie lee curtis, in her motion picture debut, became a bona fide scream queen after acting in "halloween" as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures, and she is an intended victim worth rooting for.co-writer / director john carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall. with this picture, he and his former collaborator debra hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels, many imitators, and an upcoming "re-imagining".it's very quotable - who could ever forget dr. loomis' (pleasence) speech in which he describes michael myers to the sheriff (charles cyphers, a reliable repertory player in several of carpenter's earlier works)?it's fantastic, and worth seeking out. this is my favorite john carpenter movie of all time.it's not totally infallible - there are script holes, after all - but overall it makes a solid impact.9/10

my personal favorite horror film. from the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is carpenter's masterpiece.halloween night 1963, little michael meyers murders his older sister. all-hallows-eve 1978, michael escapes from smith's grove sanitarium. halloween night, michael has come home to murder again.the story is perfectly simple, michael stalks and kills babysitters. no bells or whistles, just the basics. it's carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.the dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes i have yet to see in film. there is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. that and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. the fear is not in death, but in not knowing.the acting is roundelay good. pj soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), nancy loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) jamie leigh-curtis. her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. and of course there is the perfectly cast donald pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) dr. sam loomis. rest in peace mr. pleasence.if the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. to truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.never the less, i have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. highest reguards.10/10

john carpenter's halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers, who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters.this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise. carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date. get that! halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance's career. a true classic.

halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever! john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller. michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as jason vorhees (friday the 13th), the miner (my bloody valentine), and charlie puckett (the night brings charlie). okay, so i got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre. no longer did a monster have to come from king tut's tomb or from dr. frankenstein's lab. he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia. and on the night he came home...haddonfield, illinois and the viewers would never be the same. there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies. first is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood. many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters. this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.) along with the setting, the movie takes place on halloween!! the scariest night of the year! while most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers. besides the setting, there is some great acting. jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, laurie strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date. however, it is donald pleasance, as dr. sam loomis, who really steals the show. his portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend. however, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film. once you hear it, you will never forget it. i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture. nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of. in halloween, john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers. he always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, i think that is what makes him so terrifying. there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness. if you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find michael, he's not looking for candy on this halloween night..he's looking for blood. finally, michael myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness. his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop. he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life. so,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright. trick or treat!

i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such. i feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. i already own all the friday's so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre, the original nightmare on elm street, jaws, the exorcist, angel heart, the exorcist and halloween. now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween. because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was, i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there. no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. no movie.john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. he showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. what was that shadow? what was that noise upstairs? he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use. i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. but they don't. no one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. and it is just not the same. you can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. it's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. and halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.in 1963 a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. as loomis ( his doctor) says to sheriff brackett, " i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what i saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. " that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. and all he wants here is to kill laurie. no one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( halloween ii continues the story quite well )what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. there is one scene that has to be described. and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul. she goes to the car and tries to open it. only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. she gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. the audience picks up on this but she doesn't. she is too busy thinking about paul. when she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then myers strikes, from the back seat. this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. we know what is happening and annie doesn't. but it's astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween. it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. after all, carpenter followed in hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.halloween personifies everything that scares us. if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then halloween is a film that should be seen. it won't let you down. i enjoy being scared, i don't know why, but i do. but nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( wes craven's final nightmare ). if you enjoy beings scared, then halloween is one that you should see. and if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like urban legend. urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?and just to follow up after seeing zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. this is a classic by definition. zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.

for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. the ending is superb. the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it's ending wasn't an end but a beginning of the end. a great movie and only a piece of japan's great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind.

not on the same level as ring (or ring 2) but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless. i wish north american horror producers would take a page out of the japanese horror template and put more 'spookiness' and less cheap shocks in their flicks. lots of good examples in this one, scenes where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress, photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling, just for a second, and more. worth checking out if you like the genre.

i really enjoyed this debut by ring director, hideo nakata. if you've seen ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick. it's got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre. if you like films that give you the chills, then you will probably like this one. a good, creepy debut by hideo nakata. 8/10

this movie is practically impossible to describe. the alternate title "don't look up" is a lot more descriptive. like most japanese cinema, the story is not as linear as american. the story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww2 deserter. the set is haunted(?) by an actress who died(?) during the filming of a tv show back in the 60s. the director is the only one who saw this show. if you have seen ringu (the director hideo nakata is the same) and liked it, you'll like ghost actress. i loved ghost actress a lot more than ringu. a truly scary and disturbing movie. a 10!

after watching this film last night on sundance, i realized that much of nakata's style was first done in this film. here we have many of the same elements of the ringu series, especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural. instead of the cursed videotape, we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film. in fact, the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in ringu to mind. the only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through nakata's later films. the final scenes are quite chilling, with a bit of a nod to murnau, what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room, reminds me immediatly ofnosferatu. a chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a catwalk.

basically the exact same movie as "house of wax" - vincent price's first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because "the mad magician" offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-d effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! "never change a winning team" is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price's character don gallico, another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him. don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled "the girl and the buzz saw". gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company. the sleazy and relentless ormond, who by the way also ransacked gallico's once beloved wife, takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico's rival the great rinaldi. inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond, but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim's image and even starts leading a double life. "the mad magician" is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in grand guignol style, with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part). the 3-d delights near the beginning of the film, like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains, merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50's hype, but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them. "the mad magician" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era. needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in. like no other actor could ever accomplish, price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way. you pity don gallico, yet at the same time you fear him enormously. you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death. vincent price simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.

someone(or, something thing..)is leaving puncture marks on the jugular and draining victims of their blood till dead. police detective karl brettschneider(melvyn douglas, before slipping out of the b-movie horror genre for greater heights)is stumped at who..or what..is behind these notorious crimes. the village is overcome by hysteria and karl depends on his trusted medical genius, dr. otto von niemann(lionel atwill, in yet another effective mad scientist role)to provide some feedback as to what might be causing the deaths of innocents. he also fears for the safety of his beloved ruth(the lovely fay wray who stars for the third time with atwill after "doctor x" & "the mystery of the wax museum")who is niemann's assistant.dwight frye steals the film as a rather loony village idiot who collects bats and carries a demented demeanor wherever he goes..it's easy to see why he becomes a suspect as local paranoia is at a fever pitch. maude eburne provides the film's humor as a very naive(..and easily influenced)patient of von niemann's who believes she has ailments she reads about in books near the laboratory where he works. she's impressionable and often von niemann just humors her and constant fictional illnesses she feels plagued with. lionel belmore returns as yet another frightened, superstitious bürgermeister.creaky, static, but rather entertaining nonetheless thanks to the cast. the film is obviously as low-budget as they come, but this doesn't hurt the film too much since it's put together rather well by director frank r strayer and his crew. i'm certain the film's print has seen better days, though. this is the kind of b-horror item you'd find packaged in with 50 other random cheesefests and poverty row programmers. the film's villain..and his motives for feeding a synthetically made biological creature..certainly provides a different take on the frankenstein formula. many might be disappointed with the end results as the film strays away from being an actual supernatural tale about a real vampire killer causing the murders.

this film has a lot of strong points. it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi-karloff-chaney circle: lionel atwill, fay wray, and dwight frye, plus leading man melvyn douglas. it's got all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone staircases, a mad scientist, townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires, an "igor"-type character, a beautiful girl, even a goofy-haired burgomeister. the soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative. there's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script.but it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in "kleinschloss" ("little castle"). the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist (nicely played by atwill) who values his work more highly than human lives.it's not top-tier material, because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye. but it's worth a look if you like early b/w horror pictures.

until today i had never seen this film. its was filmed on the sets of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers.frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit, lionel atwill, dwight frye, faye wray and melvin douglas playing a character named brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother's maiden name.this is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time, only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up. from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it.leonard maltin and imdb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints. the trouble is that imdb and maltin can be wrong, and in this case i think they are since a source i trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes (the overlook film encyclopedia) quibbling about this i know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long. personally i think it won't matter that much since its at most five minutes and i doubt very much it will make or break the film.what ever the running time , if you like creaky old films, do, by all means do, watch this movie, its a great dark and stormy night film.

years ago, i found a "bargain bin" copy of this film for a buck or two. in so many ways, this is quite fitting, as when it was made back in 1933, it was truly a cheaply made film by the "poverty row" studio, majestic. however, while the film is rather derivative, it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises.the story is very, very familiar, as in some germanic town, the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires! adding to this familiarity is dwight frye. he played renfield in dracula, and here he is very, very similar--though he plays a much more harmless weirdo. in this case, he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths. the film does a good job of providing some "red herrings" (i.e., false leads) and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible, the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film. in addition, while the production had little money to speak of, it still had some good actors of the day--lionel atwill and melvin douglas--and it also used universal studios sets at night (when they were done filming for the day). as a result, the film looks pretty good overall, though i also thought that, as usual, fay wray was terrible--thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film. i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth--she always seems to be cast as the "screaming lady" and provides little new in each film.overall, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. for people who are not fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skip-able.

though not a horror film in the traditional sense, this creepy little film delivers the goods. it seems a vampire is loose in a small german town draining its victims of their blood. police inspector karl brettschneider, melvyn douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok. the only one who believes him is ruth bertin (faye wray) the inspector's girlfriend and lab assistant to dr. otto von niemann (lionel atwill) who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory. the townspeople suspect the weirdo herman gleib, played with his usual frenzy by dwight frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role. the film contains quite a bit of humor which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed. one funny part has gussie schnappmann (maude eburne), ruth bertin's aunt, thinking weird herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog. maude eburne and dwight frye make a good comedy team.this budget movie brings in elements from "the cabinet of dr. caligari" with dr. niemann using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist carry out his orders, from "frankenstein" by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "dracula" since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker. thses elements are mixed well by director frank r. strayer with a little comedy thrown in for good measure. the concoction works. the restored version i viewed used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere. so try to see the this version if possible.

in an attempt to cash in on the success of universal's horror films majestic pictures hired several popular actors from the current genre and put them in this effort that (realistically speaking) is nowhere near as good. with that, this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror! story takes place in the small german town of klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks. burgermister gustave schoen (lionel belmore) shouts "it's vampires" but the local police chief karl brettschneider (melvyn douglas) thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he vows to catch him.*****spoiler alert***** the burgermeister and most of the towns folk think that the local kook herman glieb (dwight frye) who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave. the one who is responsible for the killings is dr. otto von niemann (lionel atwill) who has created a new form of tissue mass that feeds on blood and he accomplishes this by having some sort of mind control over his servant emil (robert frazer) who goes out at night to collect the blood. dr. otto has a pretty assistant named ruth bertin (fay wray) and an annoying aunt named gussie (maude eburne) but they have no clue what he's up to but karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after herman's death.frank r. strayer was never confused with being james whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the "blondie" films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from "the old dark house" which was also filmed at universal. i'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including frye who is pretty much doing his renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping! one thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that dr. otto has over emil as the film never explains this and i had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to "the cabinet of dr. caligari" but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script. there are a few other tidbits that i noticed including the chase of frye to the big caves which is obviously an early shot of the infamous bronson canyon where numerous other films have been made and also wray's brown hair which is her true color. true horror film fans will appreciate this more than others but i think this is a fun film to view for everyone and with a cast as attractive as this it's well worth a look.

mysterious murders in a european village seem the result of the vampire bat horde plaguing the terrified community.this surprisingly effective little thriller was created by majestic pictures, one of hollywood's poverty row studios. the sparse production values and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and lend it an almost expressionistic quality. overall, it leaves the viewer the feeling of being caught up in a bad dream, which is appropriate for a thriller of this sort.even though the eventual explanation for the hideous crimes is quite ludicrous and is not given proper plot development, the film can boast of a good cast. grave lionel atwill gives another one of his typically fine performances, this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle. beautiful fay wray plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely & alarmed. dour melvyn douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who also happens to be, conveniently, miss wray's boyfriend.maude eburne, who could be extremely funny given the right situation, steals most of her scenes as miss wray's hypochondriac aunt. elderly lionel belmore plays the village's terrified burgermeister. and little dwight frye, who will always be remembered for his weird roles in the frankenstein and dracula films, here is most effective as a bat-loving lunatic.

dwight frye steals the show in this one as a foolish young man(who seems to be mentally handicapped) who gets himself blamed for vampire-like murders especially after he reveals his love for bats which he likes to stroke and give to unsuspecting friends as 'gifts'!. besides all of that, there's an entertaining mystery tale involving the above mentioned murders. underrated.

i take issue with the other reviewer's comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film, not a supernatural one! it is not the only film to have a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but turns out to be a very mundance one.other films that come to mind are edgar wallace's "before dawn" and the (more famous) "mark of the vampire". the film does a wonderful job in creating a very "spooky atmosphere", similar dracula, when renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle, or in mark of the vampire, when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a "corpse" playing an organ, while luna descends using wings! very surreal!if one likes these (often silent) atmospheric touches, this film is a must!norm vogel

the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films, some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time. price's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s, with films such as roger corman's brilliant poe-cycle (still the greatest horror cycle of all-time), michael reeves' "witchfinder general" (1968) or ubaldo ragona's "the last man on earth" (1964) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career. the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is, however date back to the 50s, with "house of wax" (1953) marking his rise to stardom. "the mad magician" of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor. this is not to say, however, that this film isn't an original, delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself. as the lines above may suggest, vincent price is my favorite actor, and, while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in, none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem.price stars as don galico (aka. galico the great), an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices, whose boss, a sleazy businessman, stole his wife (eva gabor) from him. when the boss takes away one of galico's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival, the great rinaldi (john emery), galico snaps, and a murderous spree of revenge begins...don't we love vincent price when he's out for revenge? some of his most famous and greatest films such as "the abominable dr. phibes" (1971) or "theater of blood" (1973) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders, and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does. this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price, who, as always, delivers a brilliant performance, and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan. another must-see for my fellow price fans.

i recently purchassed the very underrated dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on. i bought soul calibur (a classic) and then i stepped across the domain of resident evil code veronica. i have resident evil 1 & 2, and have played res evil 3 numerous occasions, and i have been impressed with all of them, especially no.1 which has to go down in history has a classic.but none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of brilliant gory gameplay. if its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort, ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me.anyway, the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which claire redfield searches for her brother (chris - from the 1st story), who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation. little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys.so aiding claire, with the assistant of super brat steve, u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother. the 2nd cd enables you to control chris, thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear.the control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic, when the character notices danger, he/she faces the direction it is coming from. pure genius!!overall i gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year, game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop!!. please purchase this game as soon as possible.

this game ranks above all so far. i had the honor of playing mine on ps2 so the graphics were really good. the voice acting was above standard. the difficulty level is just right. wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion. the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn't expecting. the only rating this game deserves is great.

i just can't believe that these games can get so much better, but they do. unfortunately i had to rent a dreamcast to play it, but even though i did beat it i can't wait to buy it for ps2. this is the only series of games that i must own all of them even if i have beaten them many times over. i hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an end.

one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed. great storyline with a romantic, horrific, and ironic plot. fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character! not to mention that the voice-acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series. don't miss out on the best of the series.

this is one of the best of the series, ranking up there with resident evil 3: nemesis (or biohazard: last escape) the game has a very good storyline in which you play as claire redfield in the search for her brother,chris redfield (whom you probably know from the original resident evil) it is as scary as the other resident evil, and contains alot more cutscenes.my rating: **** out of ***** stars (rating based on comparison to other videogames)

resident evil:code veronica is a great well made video game,it has great graphics,very comfortable controls,a great storyline and high fun factor.the storyline to this is claire redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on umbrella grounds,and reaking havoc at they're main lab while looking for her brother.code veronica's graphics are very good,the fire and rain effects are great looking.the controls are comfy,but the button pattern doesnt fit the dreamcast control,makeing it hard to get used to.its still fun going around some wierd disturbing place,shooting the guts out of zombies.code:veronica also has a little bit of "romance" between the two main characters.you also get to play as chris redfield,from resident evil 1.the sound in this game is better than ever,for example,even though i hate the new feature,when the giant spiders crawl,they're feet make a disturbing scampering sound,and the guns sound alot more realistic.great graphics,outstanding story,comfy controls,and realistic sound makes resident evil code:veronica a definite loved. i give it a 10 out of 10.

vincent price's follow-up to house of wax (1953), the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon, similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman. though a remake, the former (shot in technicolor) remains the superior effort; that said, apart from some resistible comic relief, the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-d showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head?), this offers more than enough grand guignol-type thrills and overall camp value (price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand on its own two feet. incidentally, director brahm's involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles (both starring laird cregar) he had previously helmed i.e. the lodger (1944) and hangover square (1945). the young leads are played by mary murphy (as price's ingénue assistant) and patrick o'neal (as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough, he would himself take the lead in a similar piece, chamber of horrors [1966], which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one). an interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique, fingerprinting, which is crucial in bringing about price's downfall (in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax)though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run! watching the star in a made-to-measure role, the film emerges a good deal of fun  particularly at a compact 73 minutes.

a pretty memorable movie of the animals-killing-people variety, specifically similar to "willard" in that it stars an aging character actor (in this case, a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne, who puts in the only distinguished performance i've seen him give) in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him. yes, this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable, so that you will cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, locations, etc. couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence.tremayne's character is "snakey bender", and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie: an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souza's music. when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend gets married to a stripper (thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert) he goes on the rampage, in the process creating a memorable pile-up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners. one amusing game you can play while watching "snakes" is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff.all in all, very cheap and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies.

scanners ii: the new order is just as good as david cronenberg's classic scanners, scanners was made in 1980 and scanners ii in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies. the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing, it wouldn't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first. scanners ii: the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well. the plot to scanners ii: the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge.scanners ii: the new order is a great sequel to david cronenberg's sci-fi classic scanners and should be seen. check this out. 10/10

as b movies go, it was well above average (i warn the reader now that i may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, although i am trying to minimise any such tendency). as sequels usually go, it was utterly fantastic(despite a "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. despite this sometimes tedious tendency, it seemed to work in this particular film, so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original "scanners").the movie was similar in ways to the "superman" series, in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents (who seemed modelled along the same lines as the kents in the "superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. the depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-conforming children, adolescents and/or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as "real genius", and (to a more superficial degree) "doctor mordrid" and struck a particularly strong chord.the film had a positive message, and was fun to watch. i found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even profoundly touching at times. these moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex(uality, in this case, as the sexual elements were tastefully done) and violence that makes b movies (or shakespearian plays, for that matter!) so much fun to watch!this is a must watch for all comic book, sci-fi, "remote viewing" enthusiasts, and horror fans! with the right exposure in the right circles, the film could develop quite a cult following, along with the original "scanners".

as a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film. but because i've enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films, i gave it a shot.it's not bad. not great, but that's something else. the film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title character. dr. mordrid also has to deal with people, and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully.possible spoilers follow.dr. mordrid can travel between "dimensions," and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however, the guard has been blinded. his eyes are ruined pits. so the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes, and hey, presto! his eyes have been restored! this sort of healing apparently only works with eyes.later, mordred and his "brother" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. guess which one wins.however, side from that, the picture isn't at all bad, though much like a comic book. dr. mordred's more "human" adventures are okay, and combs plays the role convincingly.i've seen lots worse.

possibly the best movie ever created in the history of jeffrey combs career, and one that should be looked upon by all talent in hollywood for his versatility, charisma, and uniqueness he brings through his characters and his knowledge of acting.

this film surprised me a little. i watch a lot of horror/sci-fi films and this is a straight-to-video release that caught me off guard a little. i believe this is full moon's best movie thus far and one of jeffrey combs best performances. good movie.

two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension,one(brian thompson as a kabal)trying to destroy the earth,the other(jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid)trying to save it."doctor mordrid" is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese.the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent,but the film is very short and entertaining.so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look.my rating:7 out of 10.

new york city houses one man above all others, the possibly immortal dr. anton mordrid. mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity, using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival, kabal, chained up so that he may not enslave the human race. well, wouldn't you know it? a prophesy comes true and kabal breaks free, and begins collecting elements (including platinum and uranium) for his alchemy experiments. with the help of a police woman named sam, can mordrid defeat his evil brother? "dr. mordrid" comes to me courtesy of charles band in the full moon archive collection. i had not heard of it, which is a bit odd given that i'm a big fan of jeffrey combs (mordrid) and the film isn't that old. but now it's mine and i can enjoy it again and again. the film certainly is fun in the classic full moon style. richard band provides the music (which doesn't differ much from all his other scores) and brian thompson plays the evil kabal. we even have animated dinosaur bones! what more do you want? of course, the cheese factor is high. i felt much of the film was a rip-off of the dr. strange comics. and the blue pantsuit was silly. and plot holes are everywhere (i could list at least five, but why bother). and why does the ancient symbol of mordrid and kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle? combs has never been a strong actor, so he fits right in with the cheese. these aren't complaints. full moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack-laced grape nuts. i'm guilty... i loved this film.if you're not a full moon fan, or a jeffrey combs fan... you may want to look elsewhere. but if you like the early 1990s style of movie-making and haircuts, you'll eat this up. stallone and schwarzenegger fans might like seeing brian thompson as a villain, looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate english beyond a third grade level. i did. i wish there was a "mordrid ii", but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything (is "gingerdead man 3" really necessary?) passed on this one.

i loved this movie for two reasons: 1) jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it. plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (and is absolutely adorable.) 2) the movie helped to inspire a role-playing game i thoroughly enjoy, mage: the awakening. i've shown it at various larp after-parties, and it's always a big hit.d&d love and jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well-done and thoroughly enjoyable. the plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not too badly done, and cheesy in all the right places. a good way to spend an evening.

doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. which is why i'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of full moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em' this could have been a harry potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great - i wasn't sure if ms. nipar hadn't wandered off an a-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. no, seriously! anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license dr. strange, because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.

i really enjoyed "doctor mordrid". this is a low-budget film, which may be off-putting to some, but i have no problem with it. i admire it even more for that, considering it's way more entertaining than the drivel that hollywood churns out every year. too bad this didn't get a theatrical release; i don't know about anyone else, but i would have went to see it in theatres. `doctor mordrid' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy, especially if they're into sci-fi like i am. i don't see why this is a r-rated film; only one f-word is said, and there are no gruesome death scenes, nor is there any blood at all. the timeless rivalry between sorcerers anton and kabal (anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race, while kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself. basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch. there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: seeing jeffrey combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit. that makes me laugh every time i see it. but i digress... anyway, the acting is great; the main protagonists (anton, and his lady friend, samantha), are very likable; anton is sympathetic, and hospitable, and samantha is friendly. plus, the settings were wonderful. the floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting; we're only given a glimpse of it twice, though; it would have been great to see more scenes take place here. the main setting was also very neat; anton's apartment is very roomy, and he has some cool devices, especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world's occurrences. he even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named edgar. overall, this a great film; it was fun to watch, and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles. if you can find anywhere that rents `doctor mordrid', you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it. it was definitely money well-spent)!my rating: 8 stars out of ten.

dr. mordrid, what can i say? jeffrey combs has done it again!anton mordrid has been on earth for 100 years waiting for kabal, an evil sorcerer, to come so he can kill him. mordrid and kabal used to train together as kids, so mordrid knows all kabal's tricks.the film as a little bit confusing at begin with, but soon you feel a part of the action. i won't give away the ending, so go and watch doctor mordrid!i found the film to be very enjoyable because it doesn't have a lot of violence in, nor sexual scenes. the film focused on the plot and that's what i like! i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by. this is because you are so engrossed in the film. doctor mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie! i give it a 20 out of 10. worth seeing!

the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician. however, mid-way through the very successful show, the police come and shut him down. it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created--even those he made on his own time at home. as a result, price justifiably kills the evil man. the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing, because price was a bit mad, he just couldn't stop at one (sort of like eating lay's potato chips).the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great plot twists as well as exciting action. one thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull. while it's also far from subtle, it is fun throughout, though and well worth a look.had i never seen vincent price's version of house of wax, i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9. that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film, it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it (house of wax). the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful, the formula was re-hashed in the follow-up film. both were made in 3-d, both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch. the biggest differences, and there are few, are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery.my advice is to see this film and house of wax (the price version only). they are both terrific 1950s horror films.

even though it has one of the standard "revenge price plots," this film is my favorite of vincent price's work. gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters- likeability. when you watch it, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance, even though he frightens you a little with his original fury. as the film goes on, his character becomes tragic. he's committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover that up. and again to cover that one up. and again... your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral- like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. even if the revenge story is of old, the plot devices themselves are original- gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. a shame this one isn't available for home veiwing.

i saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing! i mean there was nothing scary about this movie! it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious! i think they shoudln't have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs. jason. although some parts were gross (like the head blowing up). and any elm street film from 1- 5 sucked. this was the best besides number 1. i wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror. but if you have nothing else to do rent this and you'll laugh alot.i want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary. freddy's dead the final nightmare overall grade: b-

warning!!! tons of dead giveaways!!! don't read if you haven't seen this series! or you can, whatever.they're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another; liars, cheats, maybe even some words that can't be uttered. but when elm street 6: freddy's dead shows everyone who thought the series got old, and wanted to stop seeing him, or people who wanted their hero (or villian) just stops for his final breath, this film was it.this film starts with a parody of wizard of oz, then you see a kid who is named only as john doe, who is the last child in springwood, ohio, leaves and gets out of freddy territory. a woman who resides at a hospital/ place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy, and at the same time, has a dream about a man, a water tower, and a promise of a secret floating in her mind, goes back to springwood to figure out this frightening vision, and soon finds out that she is freddy's child, and we soon find out that freddy can only leave springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him. and beyond that, fright ensues. this film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know.this film has tons of humor, and cameo appearences, like rosanne barr and tom arnold, alice cooper, johnny depp, and a very young breckin meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and iron butterfly's "in-a-gadda-da-vida", then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts. this film will either make you hate this movie, or like krueger even more. the best of the best.

first of all, i have to start this comment by saying i'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan. i think it's the greatest horror series ever. for me, freddy is the boogeyman! of course, freddy's dead, which tried to be the last chapter back then, is a weird movie. it doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films. freddy has a lot of screen time. some think it makes him less scary, which i do agree. and that's, in my opinion, exactly the point. this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better, who he is, who he were, how he became the man haunting our dreams. for some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil. obviously those people won't like rob zombie's remake of halloween. to truly enjoy this one, you have to see things differently. it's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you. this was the first one, and it was awesome. as the years passed by, freddy killed more and more people, and nobody could ever get rid of him for good. now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of freddy's realm of terror. beside the story of freddy's past, i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie. no more kids in springwood, only crazy grown-ups. the nightmare scenes are all great. the soundtrack is awesome, especially the opening song called ''i'm awake now'' performed by goo goo dolls. in my opinion, the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can't believe it's so underrated. maybe it is misunderstood, or i have different tastes! anyway, all freddy fans should watch it. it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too, and a lot of cameos! get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed.

okay, i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst! but it's not!!! haven't's you seen freddy's revenge??? wtf! that was the worst of all!!! now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc. etc.and then i found out it was in 3-d!!! i was so excited, i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the 3-d sequences. quite a lot was in 3-d though like lisa zanes hand, dream demons, freddy's claw (more than once), lezlie dean holding a knife, lisa zane with a baseball bat, doc's hand, freddy's head exploding.i truly loved this movie because it was in 3-d, but i wish the whole movie was in 3-d not just the last 15 minutes.by the way it's 15 minutes not ten!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it. this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series. not much to see here. the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddy.the one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes. but the death scenes were very crappy in this. the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent. basically freddy's story comes full circle in this.i have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws: 1. a nightmare on elm street. (8/10) 2. freddy's dead: the final nightmare. (7/10) 3. a nightmare on elm street 4: the dream master. (7/10) 4. a nightmare on elm street 3: the dream warriors. (7/10) 5. a nightmare on elm street 5: the dream child. (6/10) 6. a nightmare on elm street 2: freddy's revenge. (3/10) i recommend it if you enjoy the series. this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is. next on my list wes cravens new nightmare.(7/10)

freddy krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns,the great character actor robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5, dream child.i hope i got the number correctly.there's been so many,and this one is one of the best,especially for the cameos by;rosanne barr (then arnold)tom arnold,johnny depp,(who did the very first nightmare in 84)alice cooper(singer)you will see freddy as a tormented child,a teenager who loves pain,and as a family guy(creepy)the effects are very funny and creative,the cast also includes lisa zane(billy's sister) breckin meyer(road trip)yaphet kotto(alien,live and let die)and amanda donahue(father knows best)i was one of the people 3who saw this in 3d,well the ending.i love 3d movies.i missed the first 3d wave in 1953(i wasn't even born yet)the second wave was in 1983.i like all the freddy movies.this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant,freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s,along with jason voorhees,chucky,micheal myers,and leather face.can you imagine a film with all of them?i recommend this to all freddy fans and horror fans alike.that freddy is such a cut up.8 out of 10.

the movie freddy's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street , yes it has comedy essence about it , so has all the other films, but how can anyone possibly say that you wouldn't find freddy krueger scary , if you were to come across this man in your dreams you wouldn't find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he doesn't care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny, and freddy also plays comic mind games with them, which in its own way is very disturbing , by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies nightmare on elm street what they are today, the writers are extremely clever making krueger comic and scary as oppose to jason vorhees , who doesn't say anything and hasn't got the wit to truly frighten his victims, this movie is about as good as freddy's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way " don't fall asleep!".

freddy's dead: the final nightmare (1991) was the last film to feature freddy krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or a co-star). the years of killing have taken a toll upon the town of springwood. it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town. the parents who killed freddy krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price. only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere. but that doesn't stop freddy from seeking out his final revenge. no matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. but this time he finds out a little more about his old life. can the kids finally stop freddy for good? what is this secret that is buried in freddy's twisted mind? to find out you'll have to watch freddy's dead. the end was originally filmed in 3-d.a fitting way to end the franchise. freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang! lisa zane, yaphet kotto and freddy krueger star in this final installment. rosanne, tom arnold and johnny depp make special appearances. a whole lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes. if you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one.i have to recommend this movie for freddy fans.

now all the kids and teenagers of springwood, ohio are all dead expect for one teenager (shon greenblatt) is still alive. freddy (robert englund) is letting him go and the teenager doesn't have much of a memory, when he's arriving in a new town. when a tough female psychologist (lisa zane) tries to break though the new patient. she's finds out, where he's from. she brings him along to springwood to spark some memories but three teens (lezlie deane, breckin meyer and ricky dean logan), who unexpected came for the ride. once they arrived in springwood, the psychologist has some memory that she did lived in that town before as a child. while freddy knows the true secret of her true identity.directed by rachel talalay (ghost in the machine, tank girl) made a grim but somewhat oddly different sequel with some visual style and funny moments for this horror/fantasy/thriller. yaphet kotto (alien) has a supporting role as a psychologist expert on dreams. this has some ingenious visual effects (not everyone will love the climax, especially in 3-d) and some good style in its storytelling. this one did out gross some of the film's series at the box office.dvd has an strong anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in pan & scan) and an strong-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd has the original theatrical trailer, jump to a nightmare opinion and cast & crew information. the "elm street" series box set, the eighth disc has interviews with the the cast & crew of this sixth film. the sixth film is also in 3-d for the film climax but you could watch it at 2-d also. this is the last of the "elm street" films until wes craven resurrected freddy into a different, darker style in "new nightmare" and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror film "freddy vs jason". watch for robert shaye (co-owner and co-ceo of "new line cinema"), roseanne barr, tom arnold, johnny depp and alice cooper in amusing cameos. written by michael de luca (john carpenter's in the mouth of madness). from a story by the director. (*** ½/*****).

freddy has gone from scary to funny,in this 6th installment in the nightmare series. it's been 2 years,well actually 11 since this film takes place in 2001.and freddy has killed every last kid on elm street except one,john doe(jacobb from part 5,even doe the film gives on hint who he is),in which he uses to bring more children to come to elm street.not only does freddy gets his wishes,but he also gets his daughter back to elm street.when she finds out what is happening,she and other kids decide to kill freddy once and for all.we also get to see some of freddy's eerie backgrounds. rachel talalay,who has been contected to the nightmare series for a long time by now.many people hate this film,but i liked it.it tried to bring out what freddy was doing with his wisecrackes...comdey and makes the series more funny than scary.so this film is really a comdey sore to speak.it is not the wrost in the series,part 2 still holds it.

i guess i'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film. is it one of the best of the "nightmare" series? maybe not, but i had lots of fun with it. freddy krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential. since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down, i felt this so-called final installment ("new nightmare" is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump. there are some great nightmare sequences, including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls. this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape, hopping around like super mario. and freddy belts out the funny one-liner, "great graphics." and since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove. anyone who remembers the first 8-bit nintendo remembers the powerglove. the cast is superb. lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead. i haven't seen yaphet kotto since "the running man," and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago. he's another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence. and who can forget the cameos? the best one is by johnny depp (from the first "nightmare") playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial. the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome! so for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on dvd! hopefully all the editions come with the 3d glasses, but i'm sure the video edition has the 3d element removed. i personally didn't see many things wrong with the film. it even elaborated on freddy's backstory. the film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the gross-out effects are terrific. could this have given better justice to the franchise? of course it could have. but rachel talalay did a fine job. and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.and in closing, i loved the montage over the opening credits. fans of the series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy. my score: 7 (out of 10)

i loved this movie. in fact i loved being an actress in this movie. iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film. i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake. thumbs up to full moon high. wish it come to cable soon. cheryl lockett alexander leesville, louisiana i loved this movie. in fact i loved being an actress in this movie. iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film. i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake. thumbs up to full moon high. wish it come to cable soon. cheryl lockett alexanderleesville, louisiana

no doubt intended as a totally campy joke, "full moon high" portrays 1950s teenager tony walker (adam arkin) accompanying his father (ed mcmahon) on a trip to romania. sure enough, tony gets bitten, and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon. a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse, and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years.but otherwise, the movie's just plain funny once it gets going. ed mcmahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy), kenneth mars's coach/principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. one of the most eye-opening cast members is demond wilson - best remembered as lamont on "sanford and son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents; then gag with gerald ford really summed him up! anyway, it's a real treat. considering that alan arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an oscar on sunday night and thanked his sons, i wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie (aside from adam, his son anthony also has a small role). quite funny. also starring elizabeth hartman.ps: director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick "it's alive".

full moon high (1981) 3 of 5 dir: larry cohen stars: adam arkin, ed mcmahon, roz kellytony (arkin) is your average ordinary high school guy. prepping for the big homecoming game, girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange placesyou know the usual. but the hair in strange places part gets a wee bit out of control when a trip to transylvania with his father (yes! mcmahon) leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs. now doomed to walk the world forever young as a werewolf how will adam get any girls?'full moon high' is not often talked about but it is a silly and entertaining horror spoof. larry cohen (q the winged serpent, the stuff) incorporates as many gags as he can possibly come up with as writer / director. arkin (h20: halloween, 20 years later) shows nice timing in the lead role. if you happen to be a fan of spoofs like 'airplane' and 'student bodies' i think you'll have fun with this chuckle-fest.

it' just funny, watch it!!! ok they want 10 lines so there: this is a spoof of 50s/70s werewolf movies. lots of satire, some political. feels like an early clouseau movie (probably due to alan arkin), but with less slap stick. if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too (once again less slapstick in this one). actually, the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo (unavoidable in a teen comedy), to really poignant socio-political satire. the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny. the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious. there are tons of (histarical) cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s inflation.anyway, just watch the movie if you get a chance!

in this send-up of horror films, 50's cold war paranoia, reagan-era america, and high school films, adam arkin plays tony, the star quarterback of full moon high in the 1950's. he and his father (ed mcmahon) travel to communist romania and while he's lost in the streets one night, he is bitten by a werewolf. when he returns stateside, he cannot control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree. frustrated, he flees town. decades later, the immortal tony returns to town and re-enrolls in highschool. he still can't control his transformations, and the townspeople, and his friends, realize he's not quite human. it all culminates during the schools big football game.i expected this to be one of those 'so bad it's good' films from the early 80's. but i was surprised that the film was actually, legitimately funny. the cast, including kenneth mars as a pervy coach, roz kelly as tony's lusty former flame, demond wilson as a bus driver, and alan arkin as a oddball doctor, go all out, with hilarious results.while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to 'family guy.' 'full moon high' has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously.

while visiting romania with his cia dad, tony(adam arkin), quite a talented high school quarterback seen as the savior to lead his team finally to a victory over rival simpson, is told by a would-be palm-reader(..in romania, the people are not allowed many books, so she took up palm reading)that he would be bitten by a werewolf("when the moon is full, don't make any appointments..you will be busy."). well, who would have thunk it..tony is in fact bitten and his life would be forever changed. after his father unfortunately dies in a mishap within his bomb shelter(!)under odd circumstances(firing at his werewolf son inside a metallic bomb shelter isn't a very good idea, especially if the bullet doesn't leave the room and bounces around like a pinball gone berserk), tony travels the land through endless years, until he's tired of packing, and returns decades(..and many us presidents)later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over simpson..a task he abandoned long ago. what was once a very white, clean-cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use, violence, and perversion. to get an idea of what the early 80's full moon high school's prom party resembles, think studio 54 with teenagers..larry cohen's parody of werewolf flicks, among others things, is crammed full of gags, homages, and in-jokes. my favorite sequences contain one in the sex-ed classroom where tony reveals to the 80's class his werewolf transformation and the introductory scene to dr. brand(alan arkin, who steals the film when kenneth mars isn't on screen), quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on earth. his task to talk down a jumper leads to two men falling off a balcony..the jumper and a fireman (trying, at first, to talk him out of it), both fuming mad at brand! brand even tries to get tony to sign a waver for his body's being donated to science so he can get his wife a fur coat! kenneth mars had me rolling in the floor as a homosexual football coach(..and later in the 80's as the principal)who likes to pat his players on the behind..his scene where tony's unloading the truth to the sex-ed class is classic. the film is loaded with inspired casting choices..just littered with funny characters and the cast interpretations..such as ed mcmahon as a very conservative military blowhard who actually looks identical to joseph mccathy standing next to his photo in the bomb shelter(..always talking about commies), joanne nail as bulging eyed ricky in present day who falls for the werewolf, elizabeth hartman(a patch of blue)as a mousy, nerdy sexually molested(..and molester)teacher who finds an attraction towards tony, james dixon as a deputy(..his great scene has him stealing a line from his police chief reciting it to dr. brand who begins mouthing the words to himself for memorization), roz kelly as jane, an undyingly devoted female desiring tony for only herself constantly demanding he ravish her, and bill kirchenbauer as flynn, tony's long-time pal and now the police chief who only got jane after his friend left town. can not forget jm j bullock as flynn's closeted gay son trying to fit in at the school hoping to find a dame with hilarious results.i like how the film pays homage to the werewolf genre such as when he's on the prowl..he's often referred to in the papers as jack the nipper because he likes to bite his victims on the cheek..and i'm not talking face. he's seen more as an annoyance than danger. the homages to carrie and psycho are nice, and the violin shtick is also amusing. cohen tosses so many zingers at the viewer, eventually one has to stick. obviously in a comedy such as this, not every joke hits it's mark, but many do. the cast makes this worthwhile. the film looks cheap on the typical larry cohen budget. notice the 50's scenes where the obvious old cast members that would show up down the road wear glaring wigs. loved adam in the lead..he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the zingers he lets fly from cohen's script. the film moves quickly, rarely catching a breath. i liked this horror comedy more than most it seems.

i'm not kidding about that summary and vote! the video distributors have packaged this as just another typical '80s werewolf movie, but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine, having done for the horror movie what "blazing saddles" did for the western. i have seen plenty of comedies - good, bad, stupid, weird, etc. (usually walking away unimpressed), and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in - it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful, and part of that is having good ideas. "full moon high" is bulging with good ideas - so many, in fact, that it can easily put the zucker/abrams team of "airplane" and "naked gun" to shame. one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch-style right-wing crackpot. the jokes, non-sequiturs, wisecracks and word-play are literally non-stop and everything, including the kitchen sink, has been thrown in. the ironic tone is very similar to that of "back to the future." some people (i.e. almost every reviewer here) must have been turned off by the spirit of anarchy here, but i almost died of laughter, and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will transpire next. since b-movie extraordinaire larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this, one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators could think of. if mel brooks had made this, the critics would have labelled it a comic masterpiece, but because it was made by cohen, it has been dismissed as schlock. critical reviews have called this movie too "silly." silly? what is a comedy supposed to be - serious?! anyway, i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of. cohen makes fun of everyone - himself included, with plenty of references to his usual brand of low-rent film-making; he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this.the humor is very mel brooks-ish, and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b-movies (especially horror) will love this. trust me: the movie isn't too hard to find, and as long as you accept it for what it is - a roller-coaster of belly laughs with no pretense of social value whatsoever - then you'll truly enjoy it!!one sidenote: this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob saget ever starred in (albeit briefly) that was actually funny.

silly movie is really, really funny. yes, it's got its dead moments, it can be a bit too obvious, it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess, but it's laugh out loud funny all the way. and it's worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook. this movie is in the same class as elvira, mistress of the dark, another incredibly funny, underappreciated film.

i don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i'm a fan of urban horror. there's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf, just the title alone peaked my curiosity. so i decided to check it out and i was surprised...it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story. is it low budget? yes. can you tell that it's low budget? yes...but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter. i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice! i don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film. all i hear is "worst movie ever". have these idiots seen every movie out there? there's thousands of movies out there, how can you categorize one as the "worst" ever? a video not "movie" like "zombiez" may be the worst film i ever seen but i can't say that it's the worst movie ever since i haven't seen every movie out there. bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs. listen, if you don't like minority based, urban films, the ghetto films, hip hop,etc then why watch these types of movies???!!! knowing that you don't like this type of stuff? sure, this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an urban horror film with a multi-cultural based cast. i don't like tv shows like dawson's creek or the o.c., they suck to me. films like "garden state", "wedding crashers" and "i heart huckabees" suck to me. i'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me. why? because i can't relate to them. they don't peak my interest. just common sense. believe me, i will never watch garden state 2: garden salad, wedding crashers 2: here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring. now back to this movie, in regards to saint405's comment above, i don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked "stupid" by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me, everyone did a great job. the actor who played ricky (i forgot his name) did a very good job. i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off. anywho, i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this, bring on the sequel!!! i'm out. jerzee representin'!

welcome to oakland, where the dead come out to play and even the boys in da hood can't stop them. this low-budget, direct-to-video production seems timed to coincide with the release of land of the dead, the latest installment of george a. romero's famed zombie series. the ghetto setting and hip-hop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner- city gore hounds. ricky (carl washington) works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother, jermaine (brandon daniels). but the teenager, bored by macaroni-and-cheese dinners in their tract house, would rather spend his time hanging with street friends marco and kev. apparently there is not a lot for african-american high-school dropouts to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and scuffle with the homeys, including rival latino gang bangers. ricky plans to sell their late parents' house and move inland to the castro valley, a more middle-class and presumably safer environment. unfortunately, before this can happen, a drive-by shooting leaves jermaine dead on the porch. grief-stricken ricky tries a last desperate ploy. he tells scotty, his lab assistant, to steal some of the experimental cell regeneration formula they have been testing on rats. when a double dose fails to revive jermaine, there is no choice except to call 911. but a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue. the boy is reanimated as a sputtering, growling zombie, chews the ambulance drivers and staggers off into the night, bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat. the feeding frenzy infects more victims, and before the night is over the east bay is a battleground between the living and the blood-spattered undead. the horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers, from ed wood to herschel gordon lewis to charles band. but low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films. consider val lewton's programmers (cat people, the leopard man, isle of the dead), roger corman's poe quickies, romero's night of the living dead and john carpenter's halloween. the difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money. hood of the living dead is more fun than several hundred million dollars' worth of recent high-priced horrors. cheapness has its charms. in truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings. here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones, lending a bleakness as oppressive as douglas sirk's bourgeois melodramas of the '50s. lines seem more improvised than scripted. "so what the hell are we gonna do now?" "just keep your eyes open for any f n' thing that looks out of the ordinary." ricky and scotty call their boss, who calls an ex-military man named romero. "i have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast." "not a problem," says the merc, closing his phone and grabbing his guns. everybody has guns, and even when fighting zombies they're on their cell phones, as who isn't nowadays? information is exchanged with naturalistic understatement. "what happened?" "we got into it with some crazy motherfockers." "deja f n' vu. it's that park zombie again. ..." ricky even has to blow his twitching girlfriend away, saying only, "she's gotten out of hand." unlike most zombie movies, this one provides a motive for mayhem. jermaine takes revenge on the gang bangers who shot him, who in turn continue the rumble. this is urban film-making that implies its own social commentary, a near-guerrilla production suggesting a future for low-budget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clichés. the brothers quiroz, who have trademarked their name as if in anticipation of a new movement, may inspire others to tell stories arising from personal experience rather than imitating tired hollywood product. considering their limited resources, jose and eduardo quiroz have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know. photographer rocky robinson gets the job done, music by eduardo quiroz is no simpler than carpenter's haunting halloween theme, and hip-hop songs by the darkroom familia and others add atmosphere. the result is promising if not exactly exhilarating. they are learning their craft and, unlike lewis and wood, who never got any better, their next may be one to watch.

let's get some things straight first: zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can have them walk, run, hell even fly if he wants to. that's what makes this original zombie movie so good. everything they did was so damn original. i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero. some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical romero movie, once again zombies don't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants. the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not decaying corpses since they just freaking died! they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood. one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat. it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it. this movie got really good reviews in fangoria and rue morgue so that made me want to go see it. i'm glad i listened. they are always right when it comes to real horror fan's tastes. 10 out of 10! go rent it!

there have been "race" pictures almost from the beginnings of the movie business. films starring almost entirely black casts have been made by segregated poverty row studios (more often than not owned by caucasians) for ghetto theaters. with the growing urban blight during the 1970s, this idea was revived with a wave of "blaxploitation" pictures made for urban grind houses which overlaid black actors and funky atmosphere over traditional b- movie plots. this trend even spread into horror features, with titles like blacula, blackenstein and sugar hill serving up blaxploitation versions of monster standards. and it didn't die with the closing of most urban theaters  it just slowly eased into the video age, and continues with low budget direct-to-dvd releases like this one. ed and jose quiroz's hood of the living dead, adopts the recent popularity of horror movies for the hip-hop audience. ricky (carl washington) is a young scientist in oakland trying to keep his younger brother jermaine (brandon daniels) out of trouble after the death of their parents. after jermaine is shot by drug dealers in a drive-by, ricky decides to use the experimental cell regenerating formula he's been working on in an attempt to save the teen's life. apparently his efforts are for naught, and jermaine's body is taken away. however, the body never makes it to the morgue  jermaine re-animates in the coroner's van as a flesh-hungry zombie. he kills the drivers, then goes after the gang that killed him, spreading the zombie infection wherever he goes. having heard from jermaine's friends kevin (derek taylor ii) and marco (raul martinez) about the attack on the gangsters, ricky feels that the only thing to do is to capture jermaine and try to cover up the whole matter before he and his accomplice scott (chris angelo) get arrested for the mayhem they've caused. however, they soon find that the contagion is spreading too fast for them to control it. by keeping things simple, the quiroz team manages to produce an entertaining little horror feature without overextending themselves to the point where things start to look shoddy. along the way, they also add in a few interesting bits of business. when first confronted with a zombie, scott tells ricky, "shoot him in the head like in the movies!"  an effective as any way to discover how to kill zombies. an extra twist is added when the first head shot doesn't kill the brain, adding to viewer unease. another good point is that the soundtrack makes only limited use of sub-eminem style rap, laying in standard "creepy" music throughout.

i'll be honest. i got this movie so i could make fun of it. i mean, come on, "hood of the living dead"? what other reaction could i have? the thing is, though, the movie (and its makers) decided that it wasn't going to be made fun of. instead, it was going to try its best to be a good movie.and you know what? it came awfully close. a little less cheese in the incidental music, a little more professionalism in the photography, the acting, the incidentals (like the props--love the best buy bag)...well, it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own. and the acting, writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected. there's even some decent humor, as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead.if you can overlook the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints in everything, alas) and the almost constant profanity, this can be a pretty fun time at the movies. no, it ain't great. yes, it could have been better. but the makers, the actors, the crew, they all tried to make a good film (instead of a camp classic) and that counts for a lot. the line of campy zombie films is a mile long, and thank you, guys, for not adding to it.kudos to the quiroz brothers. i'd love to see what they do next. and hey, somebody, give them a budget!

man, if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title, then you are a retard and you deserve to be disappointed. as for myself, i was expecting a low-budgeted cheeseball zombie flick- and that's exactly what i got. i wasn't disappointed at all. i thought it was a cool little movie. the zombies were exactly as they should be, because all of the zombies had just been turned, so they are freshly-undead zombies. obviously they did that because it would've been pretty costly if they had done full-on rotted zombie fx. i understood the whole thing, i have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie. it's called "hood of the living dead" for the love of god! would you watch "redneck zombies" and any uwe boll movie and actually expect it to be great? of course not! so why there are some morons on imdb whining like school girls about this movie, i'll never understand. oh and yes, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that this was the worst you've ever seen, 'cause you know you're full of it! you ever watch "zombiez"???? or "feardotcom"????? or "house of the dead"???? those are some of the worst i've ever seen. if you can't see that it's just a low- budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something's wrong with you. i just had fun with it. thumbs up from me and i'd also like to see a sequel.

when i watch a low budget film i know what to expect. i expect the acting not to be as good (budget reasons), i expect the lighting not to be as good (budget reasons)i expect the sound not to be as good (budget again). stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget film!!! i'm a filmmaker myself so i understand the budget constraints on a low budget film. stealing locations, shots etc... the list goes on and on. i don't want to say all the acting was bad. jose rosete, chris angelo, victor zaragoza are good. raul martinez is a natural. not sold on carl washington yet. he has to understand that every line is not important, some are throw away lines. i say if a film makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good film. i liked this movie. i gave it an 8. i wanted to see what was gonna happen next. great job quiroz brothers!

good times working with the quiroz brothers, and the entire cast on this project as the "guy on the bench." i was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true "b" horror film. hopefully i will have the opportunity to work with pumpkin patch pictures team again in the future. i moved to detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release. one time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind. it was pretty funny and that was my 1st real autograph moment as i signed her receipt. one day i asked the girl at blockbuster if the movie is rented often, and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer. at the time it was renting more than ring2 which was also a new release at the time... the title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets. she also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people don't want to give it back.... watch out for zombies when in the hood cause they will get ya! jaysun barr (guy on the bench-2005)

according to this board, i guess either you love it or hate it. usually how it goes with all movies. there is no need to get testy with others though. all we are doing here is giving opinions. i rented this movie last night and i want to come and throw my opinion in the mix. i was surprised by how many people are thrashing it though. there's a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. i'm a horror movie fan. most plain olé' movie fans don't like horror movies. so many low budget cam corder looking movies are coming out these days. it's hard to keep up. and what makes it tough to stay into these movies is how bad they are. i wanted to come and write a review about "hood of the living dead" because it's pretty damn good compared to the rest of the junk out there. it's nothing special but it's those horror film makers that try to be too serious that end up making a horrible horror film. i really liked this one. you telling me there is no effort in this one? and one more thing, i bet all of you have all of these huge dvd collections that you are so proud of, nothing but major motion pictures right? nothing wrong with that, but you have to know how to appreciate low-budget independent. i knew what i was getting when i watched this movie. i'm not going to be upset because i thought it was going to be some 100 million dollar movie. some of you might need to stick with watching the matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix. and if most of you are under 24, that explains everything. good movie folks, check it out.

hood of the living dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began. first, any play on "...of the living dead" invokes his holiness mr. romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire. and second, my movie-watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal leprechaun in the hood. skeptical, we settled in to watch. we were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie film. oh, certainly the budget is low, and of course the directors' amateurs friends populate the cast, but hood of the living dead loves zombie cinema. cheap? yeah. but when it's this cheap, you can clearly see where love holds it together. ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night. he dreams of moving out of oakland. before this planned escape, however, his brother is shot to death in a drive-by. ricky's keen scientific mind presents an option superior to cpr or 911: injections of his lab's experimental regenerative formula. sadly, little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty oakland zombie! chaos and mayhem! i think it's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive-by, but then again, i'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life. (how poor a judge? in response to a gory scene involving four men, i opined "ah-ha! white t-shirts on everyone so the blood shows up. economical! i used the same technique in my own low-budget horror film." jordan replied, "no, that's gang dress. white t-shirts were banned from new orleans bars for a time as a result." oh.)a lot of the movie is set in someone's living room, so there's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies. but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere-- it surpasses its budget in spirit. zombie explanation: when man plays god, zombies arise! or, perhaps: follow fda-approved testing rules before human experimentation! contribution to the zombie canon: this is the first zombie movie i've seen with a drive-by shooting. as far as the actual zombies go, infection is spread with a bite as usual, but quite unusually head shots don't work-- it's heart shots that kill. zombies have pulses, the absence of which proves true death. and these zombies make pretty cool jaguar-growl noises. gratuitous zombie movie in-joke: a mercenary named romero. groan. favorite zombie: jaguar-noise little brother zombie, of course!

most of the bad reviews on this website blame "hood of the living dead" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1) it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting; 2) it was so bad it made me laugh 3) it is something i could do myself. i won't even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff or not. i must say, however, that i still fail to understand people renting such a movie as "hood of the living dead" and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with lindsay lohan or matthew mc conaughey. as for the second point, i really don't see what's so wrong with laughing. i personally like to laugh, and love movies that make me to, be they comedies or horror flicks. when in "hammerhead" i saw this girl stepping into a puddle and the shark-man came out of it to eat her, i just cracked up. and i was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun. honestly, laughing just makes me feel good, while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing. if you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie, "hood of the living dead" and low-budget flicks are definitely not for you. but please don't come and tell us that you find them laughable. we already know it. this is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place. however, it is the third point that leaves totally baffled. just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see "blair witch project", which is a way more rudimentary, boring, plot-less and bad-acted movie than "hood of the living dead" (and takes itself way too seriously too). moreover, half a million people go on youtube every day to see the short films of "lonelygirl15", which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend, a room and a webcam could do! not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there. why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non-existing plot? i think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone, with affordable technology and a bunch of friends, can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests. and i feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad (yet refreshing) piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone. leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b-movies, and you'll see that "hood of the living dead" can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers! if you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movies, i recommend "zombiez", "the ghosts of edendale", "the killer eye", "monster man", "don't look in the basement", "the worst horror movie ever made", "redneck zombies", "jesus christ vampyre-slayer" and "habit".

okay. this movie is a pure pleasure. it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy. the dentist really starts to loose his mind and it's enjoyable to watch him do so. this movie is for certain people, though. either you'll completely love it or you will totally hate it. a good movie to rent and watch when you don't got anything else to do. also recommended: psycho iii

brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests, but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all. the re-animator sequels aren't as great as the original, but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series; and society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece. this thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece; but it shows yuzna's eye for horror excellently, and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging. i'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996, as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it's running away from a tiger for the modern world. dentistry doesn't frighten me, but surprisingly; i would appear to be in the minority. the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone. he has a nice house, a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want. however, his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner. and his life isn't the only one; as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger...when it comes to scaring the audience, this movie really makes itself. however, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline, only with the dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing. it isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this won't be winning any awards, the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. the acting, while b-class, is actually quite impressive; with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie. the dawn of the dead star doesn't get enough work, and i really love seeing him in films. the rest of the cast doesn't massively impress, but all do their jobs well enough. overall, the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans, and i don't hesitate to recommend this film.

when i saw the dentist, i thought it was very cool. but this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes. that's why it has it's r18 rating. it's about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone, who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman. it's best to go to your dentist "before" you watch this. but if you don't like going to the dentist already, then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life. the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i've ever seen. who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (spoiler) pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic? overall awesome flick, but not for everyone.

as dr. alan feinstone, corbin bernsen turns a marvelously deranged performance in "the dentist".with his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear, the irs hounding him, and a very suspicious acting wife; dr. alan feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each day.when the doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy, it sets off a string of events that lead to torture, murder, ant total mayhem! "the dentist" is a solid film! bernsen makes the character of dr. feinstone relatable and hateable at the same time. even though he is completely out of his gourd, the audience will still feel sympathy towards him. that my friends.....is damn good acting.a nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film. excellent direction, good killings and gore, and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run.highly recommended!

corbin bernsen gives a terrifically intense and riveting performance as dr. alan feinstone, a wealthy and successful beverly hills dentist who's obsessed with perfection. when he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has been cheating on him and the irs start hounding him about tax problems, feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend. director brian yuzna, working from a suitably dark, witty and demented script by stuart gordon, dennis paoli, and charles finch, exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well-manicured surface of respectable affluent rich america with deliciously malicious glee. moreover, yuzna further spices up the grisly goings on with a wickedly twisted sense of pitch black gallows humor. bernsen positively shines as dr. feinstone; he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that's right beneath feinstone's deceptively calm and assured veneer. the supporting cast are likewise excellent: linda hoffman as feinstone's bitchy, unfaithful wife brooke, earl boen as smarmy, meddlesome irs agent marvin goldblum, molly hagan as feisty assistant jessica, patty toy as perky assistant karen, jan hoag as jolly office manager candy, virginya keehne as sweet, gawky teenager sarah, ken foree as thorough, no-nonsense detective gibbs, tony noakes as gibbs' equally shrewd partner detective sunshine, michael stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner matt, and mark ruffalo as on the make sleazeball steve landers. the first-rate make-up f/x are every bit as gory, gross and upsetting as they ought to be. the polished cinematography by levie isaaks boasts lots of great crazy tilted camera angles and a few tasty zoom-in close-ups. alan howarth's spirited shuddery score also hits the flesh-crawling spot. an enjoyably warped treat.

this movie was very enjoyable, though you'll only like it if: - you hate going to the dentist but aren't afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk - you love horror moviesi particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character. the fact that he's totally obsessed by cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud-covered pool-man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard.liked it. i give it an 8.

the dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it's psycho. we had mad police officers, ambulance men, secretery's and that was just for starters. the dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman's nightmare.the plot is twisted. super clean dentist doctor feinstone lives perfect life in his great "white house", he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist. dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty irs guy (terminator's earl boen), dirty pool cleaner "cleaning" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter. he goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way. and you don't want to come to his path.crew were professional. producer/director brian yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like re-animator and from beyond. he directed the sequel to re-animator and his first movie society was nice spinoff from john carpenter's they live. film's producer pierre david is known from movies like scanners. cast was great. corbin bernsen really suprised me. i knew him from la law and major league, but i could newer dream him as a psycho dentist. he was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person. linda hoffman was beutiful and dumb as feinstones wife. micahel stadvec did not have much line's, but after i saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood i knew my future profession. ken foree (dawn of the dead, from beyond) was nice sight as cop on the case. virginya keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to feinstone.final warning: if you're like me and have problem with dentist's then maybe you should skip this one. but if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings.

this movie is very great! the acting is fine, with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients. in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman, and then he goes crazy. he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman, beside the patients he tortures. the most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like a drilled-out tongue, that has laid for 1 night outside, and is still red in the morning). but the torture scenes are absolutely well-done. though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow; between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts. but for the real horror/thriller-fan this is a must-watch!

first it was jack the ripper, now it is alan feinstone. the crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways. quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical. especially from corbin bernson. in some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe.

the dentist starts on the morning of dr. alan feinstone (corbin bernsen) & his wife brooke's (linda hoffman) wedding anniversary. on the surface mr. & mrs. feinstone seem to have a nice life, a beautiful home in los angeles & he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong. alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt (michael stadvec) the swimming pool cleaner, to add to his humiliation alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts (lise simms) one of his next door neighbours & to top it all off he owes the irs, who are breathing down his neck, a shed load of money. alan starts to lose his mind, he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten, just like his patient's teeth, & it's up to him to fix it. that morning at work he begins to take his frustrations & anger out on his patients, first he injures a young boy named jody (brian mclaughlin), he sexual assault's a patient named april reign (christa sauls) after he hallucinates that she is his wife & deliberately performs an unnecessary & painful procedure on another. alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it & goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife & pool cleaner...directed by brian yuzna i thought the dentist was a good film & tried something a bit different. the script by dennis paoli, stuart gordon & charles finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter, it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the 13th (1980) with a high body count & a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different. the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness & it does a fine job although having said that i'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions. it moves along at a nice pace, has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients & the decay he sees in the world around him & is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes. it goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again! i liked the ending too where the tables are turned, i'll say no more...director yuzna does his usual fine job here, in fact i don't think i've seen a yuzna film that i didn't enjoy to some extent, he obviously & predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out, sexually molesting them, performing operations on drugs & torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill. there are some other gore scenes as well, a dead dog, someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut out tongues. yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget, he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles & i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed & huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle.technically the dentist is fine, decent cinematography, music & production values although some of the special make-up effects look a little unconvincing. the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good crackpot performance. the ever cool & genre favourite ken foree turns up as detective gibbs one of los angeles finest.the dentist didn't turn out like i had expected & all the better for it, if your a horror fan & perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out. i liked it & think it's definitely worth a watch.

this is a gory mess and pretty convincing. corbin bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner. linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her, the little "tryst" with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile! the last half hour of the movie is devoted to bernson's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called virginya keehne. an extremely talented performer, she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off. nice legs, too!

as if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry, this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm. a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man (on their anniversary of all days!) and snaps big time into a furious breakdown. after shooting an attack dog's head off, he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his "slut" of a wife. there are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen. the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch. a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail. "the dentist" is incredibly entertaining, fast-paced, and laughably gory at times. check it out!

i realize this review will get me bashed by the expert film critics patrolling this site, but i will defend this film.the dentist is actually a really good film. the acting isn't always top notch, but the thrills are good and the story's good. plus you see linda hoffman's boobies. not that i'm an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense. corbin makes a great creepy dentist. it does to dentists what jaws does to sharks...ish. it obviously had a fairly limited budget, but they did well with it what they could, and developed the characters well (those that count).the end.

i remember being terrified of movie blood when i was younger, and gradually getting less so, until getting jaded enough, as i'm sure many other viewers have become, so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm. "the dentist" turned that around.the setup seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths, and perhaps bodies as well. a clever twist, though, is that the dentist is the film's protagonist, so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable. the viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims, and instead of hoping for justice to come to him, i found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life.what really "makes" a horror movie is the violence. and "the dentist" does it better than any other film i can think of. first off, the film has tons of tension, which is something that modern gore films tend to lack. in one scene (), the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time. as he reaches into the child's mouth, you hope that, for the dentist's and the child's sake, the encounter ends without injury. i won't spoil what happens. second, when the gore does come, it hits all the worst, squirmy nerves. once again, i won't give anything away.of course, being a movie that you've never heard of, it does have flaws. most importantly, it's exclusively for horror fans. also, as another reviewer mentioned, by taking place over a span of just a few days, we don't really get any background on the characters. and the tension drops a little bit during the very end. but really, the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is, and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven.it's strange, after years of being accustomed to movie gore, to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood. "the dentist" made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable, and for this it earns my full approval.

the brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. it's one of man's primal fears. this movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room. corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who i guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out. in a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor earl boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot, which i guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist. it's a typical brian yuzna situation, not well written but there's gore. the plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we've all thought of it but they did it first.

i love this movie. as a kid, this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch. sure, it is mild now, but back in the day, it was awesome. dentists are one thing so many people fear, so why not do a movie about a killer dentist? it's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it is awesome. and i have always had a love for medical horror. and corbin bernsen plays dr. feinstone perfectly, no one could have done it better. and for a low budget horror film, the effects and such are quite good. and i also love the theme music, it goes well with the film. ken foree (dawn of the dead) is also in this one playing a nosy cop, and does a fine job. there is a fair amount of blood, and some really cool torture/death scenes. check this one out!

before we begin, i have a fear of dentists. this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe. that is what i love about this film. the movie is kind of boring. for that, i take 3 stars off!*spoiler alert*the movie revolves around dr. alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. soon, he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with.*end spoiler* the movie is very bloody and gory. i would recommend it if you are into gore.i give this film 7 stars out of 10. dr. alan feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist!

the dentist is a really good thriller. and pretty disturbing. i think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters, vampires or zombies. that's exactly why this movie is so scary. during this film, you'll probably think about your own dentist a few times. whether he's capable of doing such things...you better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him. that's what the story is all about. a respected dentist in la snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool-boy. ( that must be the greatest profession in the world, by the way. poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work) from then on our dentist, dr. feinstone, can only thing about taking revenge. he can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt. things aren't made easier for our dentist when he's chased by an annoying tax-controller, a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his. at one point, dr. feinstone can't take it anymore. now he's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him.. the dentist is written and directed by brian yuzna and co-written by stuart gordon. you can take that as a recommendation to itself. these 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies ( and personal favorites of mine ) like re-animator, from beyond and society. with the dentist, they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller. this film came right on time actually. the decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far. i'm not at all saying this is a masterpiece, but it's a nice change. corbin bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene. i remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor, but he can sure handle a psychotic character. the rest of the cast does good work too. the woman who plays feinstone's wife is really attractive. also, it was great to see ken foree acting again. the actor from my all time favorite movie dawn of the dead plays the cop in this film. yuzna casted him in from beyond too, 15 years ago and i thank him for that. i don't recommend this movie to everyone (if you have a weak stomach, i'll advise you to skip it) but if you do watch it, you'll enjoy it very much. you'll be disgusted...but that's an extra reason, i think. it's been a while since i was really freaked out by watching a film. it's a great topic to handle in the genre and yuzna does it in a great way. too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel. my humble opinion on the dentist ... 8/10

i'm surprised no-one has thought of doing a movie like this before. horror is often most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme. and nobody (except for steve martin in the little shop of horrors) likes going to the dentist. tooth torture has been done before (see the marathan man for example), but this brings the terror into suburbia.the plot revolves around a dentist, dr. alan feinstone (corbin bernsen), who descends into madness. now our dear doctor wasn't playing with a full deck to begin with, but driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder he begins to reek havoc on those around him. the doctors spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in micheal douglas's character in falling down, but with a horror edge.written and directed by horror stalwarts stuart gordon and brian yuzna, its witty and has a great flow. also featured playing a cop, is the ever welcome ken foree.now i believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from corbin bernsen. having really only seen him in la law before, i was blown away by his acting.the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching, but slightly under par compared to the original.ttkk's bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe, capped (pun intended) by a great performance from bernsen

not that many films have truly exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have. those in the profession have some genuinely intimidating looking instruments. give writers dennis paoli, stuart gordon, and charles finch for deriving maximum make-you- squirm-in-your-seat shock value from their premise.corbin bernsen, in a nicely nuanced performance, is alan feinstone, dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early on. an unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he starts dwelling on thoughts of decay, even imagining it where there isn't any, and also equating decay with corruption of society in general. having witnessed his unfaithful wife brooke (linda hoffman) getting it on with their pool boy, he determines to punish her. at the same time, he's under pressure from a smarmy i.r.s. agent (earl boen, best known as dr. silberman from the "terminator" franchise) to do a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth shut about feinstone's financial affairs. feinstone starts to perceive everybody around him as decayed in one way or another, and he goes on a murder spree as police detective gibbs (the always welcome ken foree) picks up his trail.director brian yuzna clearly has great fun with the script. it allows for some genuinely nasty and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as thrilling the audience. the script gives the feinstone character some fine lines of dialog and is overall quite sly and amusing, with large doses of pitch-black humor (such as feinstone ordering a victim to "get their tongue out of the way!"). brooke and the i.r.s. agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. the makeup effects are for the most part quite good. and the film does a fine job of maintaining its forward momentum, as feinstone, with his relentless drive for perfection, switches from respected professional to unhinged killer in record time.foree, always cool and fun to watch, is rather wasted in a standard-issue detective role, but there's some enjoyment in watching boen play his slimeball part to the hilt. hoffman and christa sauls provide very appealing eye candy. and a pre-fame mark ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. but this is all very much bernsen's show as he sinks his teeth (pardon me for using that expression) into his plum leading part with total conviction."the dentist" ranks as one of the more original and interesting horror films to come out of the 1990's.8/10

this would have been so much fun to see in a theater, back in 1996. there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies."the dentist" is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters. maybe the ada launched a campaign against it, since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for "the marathon man" (which only has one scene comparable to the many in "the dentist").it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in 21 days. of course, post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for "the dentist" is picture perfect. the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "takes care" of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening. the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically "off" characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist.for me the pacing of the movie was just right. the film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way. all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office. there's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival. meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown! unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very very tight. all the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways. two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end.definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.

this is an entertaining movie. actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath, its your everyday doctor. how scary is that. got some good actors and actresses in this movie, though some where unappreciated like virginya keehne as sarah. ken foree who you might recognize from rob zombie's devils rejects and halloween(2007) co-stars as our detective on schizoid dr. alan feinstone's(corbin benson)trail. short little summary is this: dr. alan feinstone, a guy who has a sexy wife, nice house, and is a great dentist everyone loves. until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner. then he starts having hallucinations that his patients' teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller. but before that, nice guy.

doctor feinstone is a dentist.he has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool.suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant-he realises that behind everything clean,there is decay.he starts to torture his patients...corbin bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist-he is completely believable.there is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque.highly recommended."the dentist 2" is also worth checking out!

director brian yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces such as "return of the living dead 3" or "bride of re-animator", but at the same time he has done awful movies such as "faust: love for the damned" or the mediocre "progeny". he is obviously better in the seat of producer where his work producing stuart gordon's films has been superb."the dentist", is one of his lesser works as director, but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience. it tells the story of dr. alan feinstone (played superbly by corbin bernsen), a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife (linda hoffman)has an affair with the pool boy. this event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so "filthy".the premise is very well handled by yuzna, as he takes us on a ride following feinstone's day of revenge. what makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective, we follow feinstone because he is the main character. we witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day. yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie.most of the success of the premise is in bernsen's performance as feinstone. he can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time, and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film. the rest of the cast is not as good, and i think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should. a notable exception is ken foree, as the detective trying to catch feinstone. while his part is quite small, he makes a great job with it.with a dentist as killer, gory scenes are expected, and brian yuzna delivers great sfx in the correct amount. it's good to see that he does not go over-the-top with it as he usually do, and i dare to say that this is a highlight of the film. it has the exact amount of gore that is expected, nothing less and nothing more. yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great.while this is not among yuzna's most well-known films, i would say that it is one of his best. sure, it is not classic material as his masterpieces, but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring. it is a low-budget simple film, but for what it is, i think it rocked. 7/10

i remember this movie in particular when i was a teenager, my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid. of course being the blood thirsty gal that i am, i had to go out and find this movie. now i don't know how to put this without loosing credibility, so i'm just going to say it, i actually had fun watching this movie! i know that it's stupid, not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome, but that's what i was looking for and the dentist delivers in the scares, blood, sex, and crazy psychopaths. sometimes i just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by.dr. alan feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness. on the day of his wedding anniversary, he spies his wife brooke having sex with their filthy pool man, matt. at his dental practice, feinstone's first patient of the day is young jody saunders, there for his very first dental appointment. feinstone begins to clean jody's teeth. everything goes smoothly at first, until he imagines that jody's teeth are brown and rotten. his dental pick slips, stabbing jody in the gums. jody's mother picks up her crying, bleeding child and leaves angrily. feinstone sees his second patient, beauty queen april reign. alone with april, feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars. as she drifts off into unconsciousness, feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife. he begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair, then begins to choke her. april starts to cough and half-wakes up from the gas. feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re-buttons april's blouse. feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home. later that night, brooke meets feinstone at his practice. he reveals his new italian opera-themed patient room. he encourages brooke to try out the room's dental chair. when she does, feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide. with operatic music blaring in the background, he begins to pull out brooke's teeth. feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness.honestly, as silly as this movie sounds, i did have a lot of fun watching the dentist. the best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty irs agent a lesson in hygiene that i'm sure he'll never forget. man, i don't think i've brushed my teeth so much after i watched the dentist. yeah, i am going to warn you, this movie is in no way for the faint of heart, it's very bloody. there's stabbing, gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn. yet somehow i just enjoyed this movie, if i ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans, i slip it in my dvd player, and that's the "tooth" lol! i am so funny! um, yeah, i try, give me a little credit.7/10

after witnessing his wife (linda hoffman) engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy, the already somewhat unstable dentist dr. feinstone (corbin bernsen) completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients.this delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties. although the dentist' is intended to be a cheesy, fun little film, yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense. despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters, and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days, the movie is intriguing, generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest, even during the more ludicrous of moments. the dentist' suffers, on occasion, from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel, there are only sporadic uninteresting moments, and in general the movie follows itself nicely.corbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic, deranged and perfectionist dr. alan feinstone. the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines, especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex (particularly fellatio), is something short of marvellous. while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous, bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable. had the dentist' not been intended to be a fun, almost comical, horror movie, bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful. sadly, the rest of the cast (including a pre-fame mark ruffalo) failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this, stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick.the dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable, particularly (i would presume) for fans of cheesy horror. those who became annoyed at the number of scream' (1996) clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change, as i did. a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make the dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990's. on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and (on the whole) realistic scenes of dental torture, which should keep most gorehounds happy. far from perfect but far from bad as well, the dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once. my rating for the dentist'  6.5/10.

this gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated. it's pure delight and fun! gratuitous servings of blood, insanity and black humor, which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre. a full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot. only for the connoisseurs.

fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. all falls apart though, when young timmy's zombie fido eats the family neighbor. from then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). and we find the loving fido whatever he may do. this is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. i rate this 8/10. rated r for zombie related violence

"fido" is to be commended for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a most original film experience. the early 50s atmosphere is stunning, the acting terrific, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars, "eisenhower era" dress, art deco furniture, and zombie servants. it would be very easy to dismiss "fido" as cartoon-like fluff, similar to "tank girl", but the two movies are vastly different. "fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior. make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. highly recommended. - merk

who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? certainly not the makers of "fido," who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. timmy robinson is the all-american boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom timmy has affectionately dubbed fido. all of this has been made possible by zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to "life" by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time.this twisted, modern-day spin on the tv series "lassie" - it might easily have been entitled "a boy and his zombie" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. the movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (life magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled death magazine). despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade.k'sun ray, carrie-ann moss and dylan baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed timmy and his cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while billy connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.this is what "lassie" might have been had timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies.

due to the invention of a "the domestication collar", flesh-eating zombies are brought under control, and become productive members of society; however, they perform menial tasks. the servile dead attend to those living in fenced us 1950s-styled small towns, while untamed zombies roam around in "the wild zone". in the town of "willard", pre-teen k'sun ray (as timmy robinson) lives with parents carrie-anne moss and dylan baker (as helen and bill robinson). alas, the robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie; their new neighbors, the bottoms, have six. so, to keep up, the robinsons obtain zombie billy connolly (as fido).unfortunately, mr. connolly's "domestication collar" is damaged by an old lady's walker, and he eats her; then, new and hungry zombies infest the town. meanwhile, young ray has grown attached to connolly (the boy and his zombie are like tv's "timmy and lassie") and, the robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling "zomcom" authorities. "fido" doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing "wild zone"; but, it is a colorful, stylish, and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore. ray and the cast perform well, individually; with nubile zombie sonja bennett (as tammy) and owner tim blake nelson (as theopolis) the most memorable pair. director andrew currie and crew, including rob gray (design), jan kiesser (photography), don macdonald (music), and james willcock (design), deservedly won awards.******* fido (2006) andrew currie ~ k'sun ray, carrie-anne moss, billy connolly, dylan baker

for the life of me, why did this film receive an r rating?! while it is about flesh-eating zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly film--at least if your kids are age 10 and older. unlike the traditional zombie films, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values--albeit a bit twisted! the language isn't a serious problem, there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids (much like the old tv show "eerie, indiana")--yet some knucklehead slapped an r rating one it! believe me, most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film.the story is set in a parallel-type world. while the fashions, cars and mores appear circa 1953, in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. at school, kids are trained in armed combat and there's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just in case"! as for life outside of school, it's pretty weird as well, as people now have learned that zombies aren't such a bad thing! heck, using shock collars and training, they can be made into slaves who can do your housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be your "special friend".this film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave (played by billy connally). mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie's friend. dad, on the other hand, isn't convinced--as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn't yet gotten over this!! funny, irreverent and unique--this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience.

i really enjoyed this movie. the acting by the adult actors was great, although i did find the main kid a little stiff. but he carried himself very well for being a new talent. the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk. i.e. the nutty professor. if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced. i picked it up on blu-ray and i have to say the image quality is top notch. probably one of the better looking blu-rays i've seen so far. the extras were cool too. they deleted quite a bit, but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything.

in the immortal "shaun of the dead", we are introduced to a london where the slackers and the high-and-mighty alike are forced to battle flesh-eating, reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family. at the end of the film, it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour. "fido" presents us with an epilogue to "shaun" set in 1950's america, in a hilariously witty and original "what-if...?" movie.the film is set post-zombie-apocalypse, for a change; after the terrors of the zombie wars, ended by the creation of the zomcon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs. every town in the world is fenced off from the wild zone, the once-fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left-overs from the apocalyptic wars. the idyllic town of willard is your typical, pristine 50's suburbia, with one small difference; social status is measured by a family's amount of domesticated zombies. unfortunately, the robinson family has no zombies whatsoever, due to their patriarch, bill's, fear of the reanimated dead. timmy robinson and his mother helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life, until the day that helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours.the zombie earns timmy's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies, and the two form a bond to rival the classic "boy-and-his-dog" cliché... a boy and his zombie. timmy names his "pet" fido, and he soon becomes an aid for both timmy and helen to escape the prison-like routine bill has put them in. but when fido's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly mrs henderson, the robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved fido.a film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all-star cast (including "the matrix"'s carrie-anne moss as helen robinson and billy connelly as fido), "fido" is a zom-com for the ages. with some rather twisted subplots - for example, the sweet and unsettling feelings that helen and fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50's suburbia and the zombie genre, the film manages to bring out the worst (and the best) in its characters while still enabling you to care for them."fido" is, by far, one of the best dark comedies i've ever seen, one of the best films that i've seen in a long time, and the best zom-com since the incredible "shaun of the dead".

i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto. this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice. well, i was totally blown away. by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, i actually forgot who was even in it.) terrific performances from the entire cast. carrie-anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity. as for billy connolly, i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever. the kids were also great. definitely check this one out if you get the chance.and, by the way, i got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better.

fidois a very odd film. and in many ways, a very good one.my first thought after viewing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.fido has little of shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. it is a different beast altogether (forgive the pun).fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants.at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la matinée, but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia.young timmy robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school. his mom is would-be social climber,and his dad is nervy and detached.seeking to keep up with the joneses, mom (carry-anne moss) has acquired a zombie. jimmy is disinterested at first, but 'fido' (billy conelley) soon proves a great buddy for jimmy. until his collar goes on the blink...fido is not a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it is.much of the humour is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog/family moments.yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark, truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an r rating for what is, for extended periods, a family comedy.the film looks gorgeous, and is wonderfully performed by all involved.despite its difficult tonal problems, i hope this movie finds a niche, as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap.

i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i've become an instant fan. the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s, you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it. people were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here.kudos to this canadian production, the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast, including carrie anne moss, billy connolly, henry czerny and the kid.it's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit. it deserved more recognition. it's much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team. oh well. it's an instant classic nonetheless.

in an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, timmy, finds a friend in fido (billy connelly), his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie.fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous carrie-anne moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. with the authorities on fido's trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. taking the romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that i have seen.connelly's fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame, along with day of the dead's bub, and return of the living dead's tarman; it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the big yin's performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! the rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young k'sun ray (as timmy) and ms.moss deserving special mentionsray, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and moss because she is so bloody yummy!this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for imdb.

loved it! what's not to like?--you got your suburbia, you got your zombies, you got your family issues, you got your social dilemmas, you got yourself one fine retro-1950's-style flesh eating under class held at bay by an uneasy worried about whether they're the next meal upper crust. you couldn't ask for more.cast is superb. carrie ann moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife. she's both wanton, and criminally conspiratorial. every fellow's dream. k'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeding. he's a genuine screen presence. very photogenic, and natural. without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. henry czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona. billy connolly is delightful as fido. a fine actor: i wish that he had played the title role in "braveheart," with gibson directing. my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character. his fido is contained, yet accessible. a nice touch.in short, a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times, and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. a true reality show.

even without speaking a word, billy connely is wonderful as a zombie... carrie ann moss as "mom"?, even better. zombie girlfriends? "...my father thied to eat me... i never tried to eat timmy." and i thought dawn of the dead was good. it's kinda like airplane meets (meats?) night of the living dead, sponsored by zomcom..and don't forget my head coffinand fido in an aloha shirt is just way cool!and yes, the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on. sufice it to say, it all really works!

ok, i didn't know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido, honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie, but nothing about it really grabbed my attention. but when i was looking around in netflix, they were advertising this like crazy if i liked "goofy" scary movies, so i figured to just give it a shot. i'm so glad that i did watch it, this was just a great movie, it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch. like i said, it's pleasantville meets night of the living dead, it's just a great concept, what does happen after a mega zombie attack? as we see in another zombie comedy, shaun of the dead, they have fun by making the zombies left over as "handy" citizens. this is a very overlooked horror/comedy movie, i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot. but it's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie.in a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. this radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead. in order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named zomcon. zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants. in the town of willard, a housewife ,helen, buys a zombie in spite of her husband bill's zombie phobia. their son, timmy, befriends the zombie, naming him "fido". one day fido's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. timmy "kills" the zombified neighbor. when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor, they capture fido and timmy. helen comes and rescues timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing. several days later, the neighbor's body is found and the murder is traced back to fido, who is taken away to zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed. timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at zomcon. timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido back.i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's so silly but a lot of fun. billy connelly did a great job as fido and really brought, no pun intended, a lot of life into the character. i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to burry the old lady that fido attacked and killed, his last words to her were so funny, "you weren't really nice, but you liked flowers, so" and he buries her in the garden. not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend, sick, disturbing, wrong, but classic laughs. i still love how even though this is like the leave it to beaver-esquire type of world, there still is a lot of gore in the movie. so if you do have a chance to see fido, take it, i promise some good laughs.9/10

as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out. well, i heard about it, then i found the trailer. after that, that's when i knew i had to see it. and i am so glad i did. you want to see classic television mixed with zombies? no? then get lost.fido is a movie unlike anything i've ever seen. well, actually, it kind of is. it's kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie film. though when combined, it feels completely new and original. fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido. well this new pet ain't no squawking parakeet or some potty-trained puppy. it's a re-animated dead guy...a zombie. a large radiation cloud engulfed earth which led to all of the dead rising, which ensued the zombie wars. though through the genius of reinhold giger, lead scientist of zomcon, he discovered that if you destroy the brain, the zombie will perish, thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war. though due to lingering radiation, whoever dies becomes a zombie. which can be a problem especially with the elderly. though zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs, especially with the domestication collar. the collar stops the zombie's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet. but not all is perfect in this zombie utopia, collars break, old people die and....well i'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick.fido is a fantastic idea brought to fruition. with an all-star cast, and great writing fido rises above most in the comedy/horror genre. there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained. though after seeing the film, i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white. at less than 90 minutes, the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate. it'll probably end up being a cult-classic of sorts, since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie. it's a comedy/family/zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe. if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out. but if you're still on the fence, swing your leg back over and stay there. 8.5 outta 10

when you see the cover of the dvd you're convinced this is some class b cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.wrong! this is quality material and really good. it's a comedy and a clever one at that. it also is very touching in spots, with a nice spot of kindness. the production values are very good (this looks excellent), the actors are known, the film's direction and sets are great. it's amazing. who would have thought?carrie-ann moss, playing against-type, is terrific, as"helen robinson," the june cleaver-like wife; billy connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie "fido;" tim blake nelson ("mr. theopolis") is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "tammy," and henry czerny and dylan baker as dads (check) are excellent, too k'sun ray as young "timmy robinson," shouldn't be overlooked, either. in fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.if i explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. you'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very, very pleasant surprise. you need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd.

my goodness. this movie really really shows the talents of actors. billy connelly flexes his acting muscle. truly an amazing man, if you look at him in absolution as a rebel, boondock saints as a madman/killer, and then finally in fido as a zombie! his character in fido looks from cute to frightening, absolutely fabulous! cariie ann moss is no hack either! jumping in career from matrix and momento as a darker character, to a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife! rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type-casted.now onto the storyline (no spoilers, don't worry). this movie would make max brooks (author of zombie survival guide & world war z) happy with joy! finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy.if you like zombies, if you don't like zombies, if you are just bored, or if you are too busy, go see this movie!

this film takes place in the 1950s. according to this the dead (called zombies) have arisen to eat the living. however a company has developed a collar that, when put around the zombies neck, makes them docile and perfect servants. the robinsons mom helen (carrie-anne moss), dad bill (dylan baker) and son timmy (k'sun ray) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one. tim names the zombie fido (billy connolly) and becomes friends with him. but his dad hates him and timmy looses control of fido and things go wrong.as you can see this is--among many other things--a takeoff on the "lassie" series with fido being a stand in for lassie. timmy was named that for a reason! every single of the famous lassie episodes are spun here. my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him! also it's a satire of those 1950s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful--but dark secrets are tearing people apart. the characters wear very bright 1950s clothes (moss is always in a dress)--the furnishings, settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors. even when the script becomes repetitious there's always something to look at. the script is good--but there are only so many lassie jokes you can make. the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off. everyone here is excellent and right on target. even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. moss is the best--playing each line for all its worth---but never going overboard.this isn't for everybody (of course). the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame. the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously. so, for some people, this will really work. i give it an 8.

and this somebody is me. and not only me, as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater. why did the people love it? it's obvious: everybody knows zombies by now (at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the "dawn of the dead" reinvention or resident evil movies etc.) or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that is until this movie came along. and you'll see zombies in a new light (perhaps). this is not a horror movie, although it does contain some violent scenes, but is rather a comedy. a satire to be precise. and it never runs out of steam! that is why i rated it so high. pacing wise it's incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... quite the contrary: it's a gem and if you're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it! and even if you dislike them, watch it! because it's a great (comedy) movie!

a year or so ago, i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area. since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called 'fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals. two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater. and, just yesterday, i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release, with the exception of our local theater. in fact, here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater, including 300. of course, this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up. and for any other locals who haven't seen fido yet but are considering it, i can say there are many images on screen, from the school to city park to the forbidden zone, that you will recognize. in fact, they make the okanagan valley look beautiful. that's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! however, fido itself is a very good movie. yes, despite its flaws, it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market. fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead. this is a clever premise. and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to mccarthyism. furthermore, it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the dead.k'sun ray plays a small town boy who's mother (carrie-ann moss) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block. however, his dad (dylan baker) is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father'. eventually, the family does acquire a zombie named 'fido' (played by billy connolly), and adjusts to life with the undead. billy connolly was inspired casting. he is able to convey fido's confusion, longing, hatred, and loyalty through only his eyes, lumbering body, and grunts. connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones. this is his best role since mrs. brown.fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon. being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones, i prefer humor over gore in my horror. however, i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in fido. yet, i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor.the movie does break down in it's third act. it's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s, they forgot about the story arc. however, given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen, i rate fido 9 out of 10.

this is the first must see film i've seen in the last year! it's wickedly funny, incredibly original, unbelievably great looking (they went for this super cool wide-screen technicolor look that's awesome to behold,) and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society. it's really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to race issues, while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear. carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her! she's sweet, funny and sexy! billy connolly is great as fido who can only grunt and moan! and dylan baker as the dad is priceless. in fact the whole cast is perfect. henry czerny as the bad guy, tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend (getting the idea now?) funny, though-provoking and just all round amazing! go and see this movie! it's like nothing you've ever seen before.

set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such american obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as light as a feather.zombies are featured prominently among the characters. crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? who owns how many zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? and, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? somehow, director andrew currie, who also co-wrote the lively screenplay (with robert chomiak and dennis heaton), keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh. a super cast helps: carrie-anne moss, billy connolly, dylan baker, henry czerny, tim blake nelson, mary black and sonja bennett are the principals, aided by young k'sun ray as timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (having seen her only in "memento" and "the matrix," i had no idea that ms. moss had such fine comedienne chops.) the production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. maybe this one isn't for everybody. it surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual bizarro award. but intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making. for me anyway, "fido" is a hoot! my grades: 8.5/10 (a-) (seen on 01/30/07)

fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days.as has already been pointed out, this is hardly a real zombie film, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers. while there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented (feel-good 50s style), i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido & his fellow sufferers.while the cast is generally good, i felt that moss and nelson stood out. the humor is not in-your-face, but rather subdued; there's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie. this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema, but it doesn't strive to be - instead, currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy.

saw this movie at the vancouver film festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish, and funny.the cast was rock solid. great work by carrie anne moss, dylan baker, tim blake nelson, billy connelly and up and comer, alexia fast.weirdly, i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it.writers, dennis heaton, robert chomiak and andrew currie layered in a lot of political subtext - but didn't whack you over the head with it.the world they created had depth, and made sense. there is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie.fido is guaranteed to cure grumpiness.loved it!!!

just saw the world preem of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered (certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully) by george romero. but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it's a comedy! and, yes, i actually think it is better than 'shawn of the dead'. thoroughly believable and, perhaps even more importantly, enjoyable performances by dylan baker, carrie-anne moss and young actor k'sun ray, whom i suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features. however, i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as neighbour mr. theopolis, essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van dort from the corpse bride (or, for those who've seen the film, wouldn't that read even better here as the corpse pride?) and, of course, scotch actor billy connolly in his least animated, yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character. just think, he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter stormare's commitments to prison break (as was revealed in the q&a following thursday night's screening). i can't help but speculate that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the dead's zombie 'bub'.i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i won't start now. suffice it to say that fido is not one of those dour, graphically gory zombie films you can rely on from romero. rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and, although (and i did have to think back carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence, the delectable humour, so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by director currie and his co-screenwriters, goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg-13. i urge you to go see this little canuck gem. i'll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer.

at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing i'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'shaun of the dead'. now, given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, i realise this is a rather big claim. and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'fido' will appeal to you.in a way the comedy picks up where 'shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s living dead-era stereotypical middle-american small town. the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. this, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? the beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. it's also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like...so in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.

i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up. quite frankly, i'm just happy fido got picked up for us distribution. in any case...ever seen shaun of the dead? good. how about lassie? able to reconcile the two? well, if you can your name might be andrew currie, canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy, or zomedy. (seriously, that's what the press book in toronto called it.) though not as violent, dry, or british as shaun of the dead, fido remains true to its roots: a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both lassie and the infamous sci-fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period.fido's talented headliners (carrie anne moss, billy connelly, dylan baker, and tim blake nelson) stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script. the film explores all the implications of its premise: a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident. what would you use your new undead servant for? a butler? manual labor? a pet? unspeakable acts? fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way, with much thanks to the work of connelly (as one of said zombies) and young tv actor k'sun ray, who seems at times to be a better young elijah wood than the young elijah wood was.if you're expecting another shaun of the dead, don't waste your time. there's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed. but if you're willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake, you're in for a treat. think of fido as the sensitive, more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the dead's rebellious loser, and you're starting to get the drift. if you like (or at least tolerate) zombies, small children, and loads of deadpan satire, fido's the film for you. if that's not the case....well, you know the drill. just hit 'em square between the eyes.

a family (mother-patricia clarkson, father-jake weber, son-erik per sullivan) go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter. they accidentally hit a deer while driving there. this angers some of the locals--especially otis (john speredakos) and things slowly (very slowly) go wrong.i was expecting the worst when i started watching this. the bulk of the reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative. well...i disagree. first off it's not a horror film. the horror doesn't even begin until the closing 30 minutes. it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in. on that level, it's pretty damn good.first--the bad stuff: the pace is way too slow; jake weber is a horrible actor; way too many false dream sequence scares; the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable.the good stuff: pretty good dramatic script; clarkson is excellent as the mother; some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary; a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber (which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot!); pretty good acting by sullivan (only 10 at the time!) and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending.i think many people are annoyed with this film because it's being pushed as a horror film--which it isn't. so, if you can ignore that, i think you might like it. i'm giving it a 7.

if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say. importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here, but not flatly on the surface. you could technically call it a "monster movie" even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end, and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast. some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores, though in fact the less you see of the creature, the better. fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out.

this movie is excellent. i found it very interesting. i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool. the acting was also great, as well as the costumes, production, photography, directing and script. a very happy family, on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer. a huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer's antler's is broken. he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them. see this movie. it's worth it. kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. two thumbs way up!

wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes. the acting is good, the characters act like a normal family. the wendigo effects are good, the deer form reminded me a little of the rabbit in donnie darko.the film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer, a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named otis starts to argue with the dad george, after the car is lifted they drive off to the house. the son miles is a little shook up about the deer but his parents try to tell him that it's natural for things like that to happen. that night while he's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom, the next day they go into to town and miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the wendigo, when miles shows kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there. once returning home george takes his son sledding and while there sledding he's knocked off the board and miles is chases by the wind, after gaining conciseness they go looking for george, they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot, in the hospital kim tells the sheriff that otis may have shot him, the shrieff goes to otis's place where he's bashed over the head with a hammer, as otis drives down the road he finds that the wendigo is after him.wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments. check this out. 10/10

now this is what i'm talking about. finally, a low-budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage. wendigo, while occasionally flawed, is a triumph of the imagination. granted, it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness, but it's still a damn sight better than 99% of direct to video dross.the story is pretty simple: a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter. but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo. is it real? is it all in the boy's imagination? is it an externalization of the child's emotional state? some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it's left to you to decide. don't be put off by such petty nonsense. a film that makes you think is not one to avoid. it's one to rejoice in.

a haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude. keep your freddys and your jasons -- this film is in the same company as "the haunting" (the original). lyrical and truthful, it stays with you long into the night, much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows. a smart rent.

if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say. importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here, but not flatly on the surface. you could technically call it a "monster movie" even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end, and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast. some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores, though in fact the less you see of the creature, the better. fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out.

this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them, and how they (and we) use myth to make sense of it all. i think it's been misperceived, everyone going in expecting a stalkfest won't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story, it's here.......

george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.but what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey,where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit,half animal and half man wendigo,haunts a small town..."wendigo" by larry fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.the acting is great,the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined,or even if the story is taking place entirely in miles' head.overall,"wendigo" is my first contact with larry fessenden's work and surely won't be the last.give this film a chance,if you don't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10.

from the first scene, i was really excited. "i can tell this is going to be awesome!" i thought. the acting was so good, i felt as though i was eaves-dropping on these peoples' lives. the music too was exquisitely unsettling. the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward (one could sense) toward some irrevocable fate. the build was slow, but i personally love that kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn't get derailed before it's ready to pay off.so everything's going fine, and then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the credits are rolling. "what?!!!" was all i and my movie-night companion could say. if you understand the director's intentions, the blunt ending does make sense (for those of you who have seen the movie already, check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic.com), but i can't help saying it was not pulled off quite right.this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax. in any case, it's too bad. those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (but for those of you who don't write or make films, you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt, and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal!)wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished. but hay, i'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days).one other comment. some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing. i don't know how to explain it, but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent "monster" forms. although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie--i don't know, it still worked for me in some crooked way. i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again! :)

**possible spoilers**the biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is the wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie usually isn't far behind it. the filmmakers' interpretation of the wendigo's form is interesting, and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror, for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good. however, as a monster character it never really comes to life. we don't get much of an explanation for its behavior, and what we do see from it doesn't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself, or any wendigo lore i've ever read.i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do, in the movie. when you boil this film down to its bones, what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element, instead of a movie about a monster.the cinematography is good, though a little cheesy; the filmmakers use scenery, lighting, and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well. the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster in the film. it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo, which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend.i have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason the wendigo doesn't do much is that, when the monster suit was built, it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable (in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves, the performer had to walk on his toes) that it was nearly impossible to run, walk, or otherwise perform in it. thus the many flashes of the creature standing still, and the obvious sped-up footage of it running. i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed.

a solid b movie.i like jake weber. his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances. i liked the relationship between the father and son. i liked the family dynamics. the wendigo looks silly, but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer. it's an amalgamation like, see? this is a psychological story, not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick. watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine.nice work.

this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated. the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and, as with most younger children, he gets frightened easily. mainly because he simply doesn't understand things, like why his father is hardly ever there for him. from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the little boy doesn't. also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods, as it is established early on in the film, that the family is from the city. also, in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer, then get held up, then they argue with the locals about it, and the little boy surely didn't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all.the "wendigo" is ultimately what his young, innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this. there is the american indian legend, but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it, it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically. not because that's what the wendigo actually is, but because that is how he understands it. when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it. obviously it was low-budget and shot cheaply, but the jumping montages, use of light, and general eeriness more than make up for it. and the final question the film asks is: is it all in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10rated r: profanity, violence, and a sex scene

if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore, tons of jump-scare moments and unrelenting, escalating scenes of excruciating death, then look elsewhere. if you like quiet, moody, thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread, then wendigo is for you.thoughtful, stressed out george, his psychoanalyst wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city. on the way up, george hits a stag with his car. the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase. in particular, deranged hunter otis takes it personally. he follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. he spies on george and kim as they have sex. he fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home, letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return. when kim takes miles to the drugstore in town, miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case, carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag. a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo, a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry. miles takes the figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. that afternoon, when he and his father go sledding, george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed...or is he just in shock, and imagining the whole thing? hours later, george is rushed to the hospital and miles, still clutching his statue, either faints, dreams or goes on a vision quest, in which the wendigo returns. this time the angry, flesh eating god - part tree, part stag and part man - is hunting for otis, who has finally gone over the edge.wendigo is a beautifully made film, almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees. okay, so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking, but it's a small flaw, more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film, and the eerie backdrop of the silent, snowy countryside. the performances are great, particularly by jake weber as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife. they are a happy couple with their share of common problems, and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful. watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos, so realistic are the performances. this movie is not for everyone. a lot of people may find themselves totally bored, waiting for the hideous lovecraftian beast and bloody revenge that never come. we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists, seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also, later, through the eyes of a madman. this is more a psychological drama than a horror film, but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror.

larry fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum. well, the worst mistake, evidently, is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted. obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. "wendigo" is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles. things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. it is obvious that kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. this is also a story of alienation. it's clear that the father, george, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world.miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country. that part of new york state, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the little boy's imagination. it doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. ultimately, miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything, even evoking the wendigo spirit.the film is well paced and acted. patricia clarkson is excellent, no matter where movie she is in. jake weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand. erik per sullivan, as miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what's going on around him. finally, john spredakos is perfect as the menacing otis, a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.

kim (patricia clarkson), george (jake weber) and son miles (erik per sullivan) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattan's bustling metropolis. on the way, they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow. a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along. rather than helping, at least one of the hunters, otis (john speredakos), is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers. george, kim and miles are disturbed by otis, and even worse, we quickly learn that otis has learned where they're staying. meanwhile, miles is given a wendigo (a kind of indian shape-shifting spirit/monster) token by an indian whom only he has seen. is otis a psycho out to get our heroes? are there wendigos in the woods? i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers. it is a fairly low budget film, with technical limitations frequently showing through. much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature. and perhaps the fatal blow for many people, it has a very ambiguous ending, with a number of questions left unanswered. if you are discouraged by such endings, and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant, do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo.personally, i like films like that. i usually prefer some ambiguity. the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick, scary creature flick, where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end, and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2: the monster returns, but that's not what this film is. wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people. heck, writer/director larry fessenden even has a character, george, reciting robert frost. the frost poem, and george's comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things, is the key to the film.one of the best things about the film is its complexity. in a way, there are four different films occurring at the same time, a thread from each character. in george's thread, he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world, and he has some parenting problems. for him, the film is a realistic, horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse. in patricia's thread, she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family. she's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her, hoping that they'll go away and get better. in otis' thread, he's even more down on his luck than george, and george's arrival into his life symbolizes the final "crack" in his psychological armor. and in miles' thread, which is probably the most important of the film, life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world. but this is a horror story, after all, albeit one with a glimmer of hope, and the events in the film give miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn. still, when everything is said and done, he seems to be the only one retaining his composure, due to the poetic outlook.even though the film is low budget, there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions. fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations, and created some interesting slide show like montages (such as the cards, or the indian wendigo images from the book). there are also interesting more traditional montages, such as miles' nightmare. wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.other technical aspects are good for the budget. the "wendigo" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous. the lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been, but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock (it could have been digital instead) or transfer. i thought the performances were good and far more realistic (if you value that) than the majority of films. although i didn't really notice the score, it must have been okay, or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment.overall, wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions, as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch.

robert urich was a fine actor, and he makes this tv movie believable. i remember watching this film when i was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich californian town. urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family, and i love the halloween space suit idea, brilliant. this film is about the battle of one's sprit. tv quality, that exceeds, the big budget, gangs of new york. i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie? i hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.

everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in, as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. but no paradise would be complete without its snake. strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly holds secrets. the father is not a joiner, but pressure is on him to join, as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members. robert urich's good guy part is a bit tepid, but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles. suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson. look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet. the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for. i have seen this movie quite a few times.

a classy film pulled in 2 directions. to its advantage it is directed by wes craven. on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget. it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club. his latest invention, a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood. anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci. her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later. the actor, scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine. lucci and barbara steele's portrait in 'black sunday' were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae. probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine. so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film.

better than the typical made-for-tv movie, invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting (urich, lucci, cassidy, mccarthy, pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto, soleil moon-frye) and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot. urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles. kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live, the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10

when the scientist and family man matt winslow (robert urich) finally accepts the invitation to work the micro-digitech corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife patricia (joanna cassidy) and their son robbie (barret oliver) and daughter chrissy (soleil moon frye) to a huge modern house in the corporation compound. they meet their friend tom peterson (joe regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle, and tom invites the winslow family to join the steaming springs country club. tom tries to seduce matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in micro-digitech, but matt is not tempted with the offer. later he is introduced to the director of the club, jessica jones (susan lucci) that befriends patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about jessica and the members.in the 80's, when i saw "invitation to hell", i liked this movie that partially recalls "the stepford wives", with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound. i have just seen it today, and i found a great metaphoric message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries. i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story, but i believe it fits perfectly. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "convite para o inferno" ("invitation to hell")

a good film, and one i'll watch a number of times. rich (the previous commenter)is right: there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards, and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation. were there more in the original? or was a native-language audience expected to lip-read more? or -- since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based -- was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? in short, very worth a look, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it.the alpha video release touts the new organ score, but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way. sure, it starts promisingly, but degenerates into a repetitive, phillip-glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen. after listening for a while, i turned off the sound and simply watched: much better!

in this truly fascinating, dark film, a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, in return the devil takes his mirror image (this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when balduin, the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man at war with himself" which portents his immediate future. the student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he has made a pact with the devil, he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul) you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money, you cannot have both. balduin is haunted by his double (the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action. some of the scenes are incredible, the sense of doom when the devil disappears with balduin's mirror image is amazing, as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society (the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the 'wasteland' at the edge of the town, no longer entirely human (he has lost his soul) he is like a hunted animal outside of human society. there are so many other things to say about this incredible film. paul wegener was an amazing actor and director, a cultural hero of mine. it helps if you know a bit about german history at the time this film was made and about german doppelganger tradition (don't google it, get a proper book)just remember, it's a very early film, it's a little clumsy at times, but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale, it's one of the best ever (yes it is!)

this early version of the tale 'the student of prague' was made in germany in 1913, starring paul wegener (who was also in 'the golem' a few years later). in this film he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning.moving at a fast pace (the film runs just over an hour) and fairly well written and characterised, 'the student of prague' has echoes of the faust legend as well as dr jekyll and mr hyde, starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and developing into good and evil sides of the same person.

those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on. this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money. unfortunately, the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently, tearing his life apart. there are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and, of course, the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time. the middle part is a bit dull, but the faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. one thing i have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie. also, they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing. i first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it. i was not disappointed.

a stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman--so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. an evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants that's within their room. the dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror--and bad things naturally occur as a result.if this film had been made just a decade later, i am sure i wouldn't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film. after all, the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is, at times, a bit stilted. however, when you consider that in 1913 "full-length" films were rare--and often only 20 to 30 minutes long! plus, the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual--as stories were very short and broadly acted. so, given the limitations of the time, this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known.

'the student of prague' is an early feature-length horror drama or, rather, it is an "autorenfilm" (i.e. an author's film). this film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinéma, or just make a profit, by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen. fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. using alfred de musset's poem and a story by edgar allen poe, it centres on the doppelgänger theme.unfortunately, the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make paul wegener appear twice within scenes. guido seeber was a special effects wizard for his day, but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. film scholar leon hunt (printed in "early cinema: space, frame, narrative"), however, has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme: characters being split by left/right, near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots. regardless, the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. worse is the lack of editing; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. none of this is unusual for 1913, but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time, including the better parts of 'atlantis' (august blom, 1913), 'twilight of a woman's soul' (yevgeni bauer, 1913) and the short films of d.w. griffith.an expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake. furthermore, the remake has a reason for the lyduschka character, other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. here, the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. i know their world is silent to me, but i assume, with their lips moving and such, that their world would not be silent to them, so how can lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed?nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. wegener, who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film, in addition to playing the lead, would later play the title role and co-direct 'the golem' in 1920--helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in german silent cinéma.(note: the first version i viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with faces bleached at times and such. i'm not sure who was the distributor. i've also since seen the alpha dvd, which, at 41 minutes, is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards, but is visually not as bad. the repetitive score is best muted, though.)

if "the cabinet of dr. caligari" is the father of all horror films (and of german expressionist cinema), this pre-wwi film is the grandfather. the titular student, starving in an empty garret, makes a deal with the devil-- the devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold, in exchange for "anything in this room." the devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror. he walks off with the student's doppelganger, who commits crimes for which the student is blamed.the film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking; the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects, but the film is, of necessity, virtually all shot in shadowless daylight. but the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a wallop.more interesting for the trends it fortells than for its own sake, the student of prague is still worthwhile.

one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german expressionism, the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in berlin. classic movies like "das cabinet des dr. caligari." (1920) and "nosferatu, eine symphonie des grauens" (1922) were the most famous direct results of this movement, and while the movement didn't have a long life, its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today, specially in the horror genre. one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener, director of 1920's "der golem, wie er in die welt kam", as in his debut as a filmmaker, seven years before the making of that classic, he was already making experiments with expressionism in film. that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally, another horror film: "der student von prag"."der student von prag" ("the student of prague"), is the story of balduin (paul wegener), a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague, but who always find himself with financial troubles. one day, balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit (grete berger) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident. balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again, but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin, graf von schwarzenberg (lothar körner), who also wants to marry her. knowing that he can't offer her much, balduin wishes to be wealthy, and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli (john gottowt) enters the scene. scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room. balduin accepts the proposal, only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror.loosely inspired by edgar allan poe's short story "william wilson" and the classic legend of "faust", the story of "der student von prag" was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers, a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature. written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form, "der student von prag" shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes. like most of the scriptwriters of his time, ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater, although "der student von prag" begins to move away from that style. while a bit poor on its character development (specially on the supporting characters), ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduin.while "der student von prag" was paul wegener's directorial debut and stellan rye's second film as a filmmaker, it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly. giving great use to guido seeber's cinematography, the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do. wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his "golem" series from seeber and rye. despite having very limited resources, rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing (for its time) visual effect for the scenes with balduin's reflection (played by wegener too). already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film, wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers.as balduin, paul wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie. it certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer, but one can't deny that wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract. john gottowt plays the sinister scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove. few is said about scapinelli in the film, but gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared. the rest of the main cast is less lucky, with grete berger being pretty much average as countess margit, and lothar körner making a poor graf von schwarzenberg. however, it must be said that lyda salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and fritz weidemann made an excellent baron waldis-schwarzenberg, showing the dignity that lörner's character should have had.considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake (made 13 years after this film) is superior in every possible way, it's not difficult to understand why "der student von prag" hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films. the movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget, as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what ewers' story needed to be fully developed. this makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times, or even incomplete, as if there was something missing in the narrative (of course, there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete). however, "der student von prag" is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that, while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time, left a powerful impression in history.as the direct predecessor of the german expressionist movement, it's hard to deny the enormous importance that "der student von prag" has in the history of german cinema, probably in the history of cinema in general. it may look dated even for its time, but considering the limited resources its director had, it's truly better than most films from that era. as the movie that started paul wegener's career, and with that german expressionism, "der student von prag" is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 7/10

the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j-horror movie. this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks.the story is about perception of the people who works, lives, and loves of our protagonist, and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth. the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course, and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems. the movie mostly took place in a small, out-dated radio station's studio with a very bad history, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating. it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind. what i like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did. this movie is a very smart, abide rather short 76 minutes film.

like talk radio, the booth is actually kinda predictable (talk radio because we know the truth of what happened going in, the booth because of- let's face it- the genre and the basic set-up). that's not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. it means, in essence, that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in, say, an american version of this story. the booth moves inexorably toward its (foregone) conclusion, but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of (very scenic) road. it reminds me of harlan ellison's spooky short story, flop sweat. the claustrophobia is, at times, almost palpable. worth a nice long look.

i liked this movie because it basically did more with less. it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more (though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop).the guy playing the dj did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories. i also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny.while parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away, other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did.i thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part, concentrating more on the living side of the equation. the last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed.while it was a shorter movie, it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story. any more and it would have started to drag.

a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. there's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works. the scares are very subtle, not the jump-cut scares that seem to populate most recent asian horror films. the way the "scares" are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in "the uninvited" (aka 4 inyong shiktak, directed by su-leon lee), but this isn't nearly to the same caliber. the film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. it's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance.

astounding.....this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie, but i sure enjoyed it.that last man who commented is a fool, this movie was one of a kind, and the music dark, jerry goldsmith himself, would had applaud this movie.great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film.i collect horror movies and soundtracks, so listen to what i have to say, not that other idiot.there is only one thing that do not fascinate me, the endings.according to prophecy it is all inaccurate, including final conflict, and left behind.but my conclusion being.... there great movies...and should be seen, before the great depression falls upon us, and before the democrats take over the presidency too.so signed....jacob eder...a farmer, with a mastermind.

i thought the movie was actually pretty good. i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. i have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. the acting was pretty good the f/x and stunts were well done. a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok.

always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very very complicated young gal,(holly gooding),"skipped parts",2000, who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer, george newbern,(patrick highsmith),"far harbor",'96. many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father. if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture. if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern, this film should be seen only on halloween night! however, it sure has it's surprises in the end!!!!

there is a certain genius behind this movie. i was laughing throughout. the scene in the phone sex office, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor. execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent. the doppelganger split at the end was like... "ok, wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say". certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level? i'm easily bored by many movies, but this one kept my interest throughout.i think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. horribly bad, but good. i'm looking for other movies this person may have done (with more experience).

drew barrymore was excellent in this film. this role is the type of role you don't normally see drew play. her typical role is as a woman looking for love. the storyline is also great.when holly is implicated in her mother's murder she moves to l.a. she moves in with a guy who becomes her lover. but her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused. it is then revealed to her lover that she has multiple personality disorder. after that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her. in the end though, they find out the truth.

when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at tiffany's, you know something is going to go right. drew barrymore, patrick highsmith, leslie hope, and sally kellerman are excellent actors. the fbi agent was a terrible actor. the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier, those was just weird. drew barrymore is very hot. intimate strangers, where sally kellerman worked, was a great part. the weird gummy worm was just weird. nathan was a very handsome cat. but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr. gooding attacked him? and the scene with dr. wallace? what was he doing fumbling around in there? and not every male has a female, as sally kellerman stated. and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of victor's, that was weird.

i liked it! the plot was weird, drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them. drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time. dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool, and as always he does his best - i'm a major dennis fan anyway, that's why i bought the dvd.i didn't get the ending! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool, which is ok i guess but it could have been more. ....and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it? it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc-or was it dennis all the time? because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick. in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice.the music was ok but obtrusive in places, the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone.a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude. all in all a bit of a gpm-guilty pleasure movie. don't read too much into it, don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it. there are some diamond moments and goofs galore- watch it and just have a bit of fun with it!

excellent episode movie ala pulp fiction. 7 days - 7 suicides. it doesnt get more depressing than this. movie rating: 8/10 music rating: 10/10

i just can't agree with the above comment - there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one, it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence. what's more, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way, not pulling any punches in what it shows, yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter. it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema, and deserves a place amongst the canon of 'different' horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring (both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on). it's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema.

der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film - but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it's reasons and ramifications. those looking for a gore-fest, or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed. der todesking is definitely an "art-house" style film, so those that need linear, explainable narratives need not apply...the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an "episode" for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide, interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse...there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes, including the man talking about the "problems" with his wife, and the concert massacre (which unfortunately lost some of it's "power" on me, because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions look-alike band on stage...). but seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful (the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene, and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge...), sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (the she wolf of the ss rip-off is pretty amusing), sometimes harrowing (i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective) film that is more of an "experience" then just entertainment, as many of these "art" films are meant to be. still, i didn't find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm, and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik 2 in terms of my personally "enjoyment level". definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or "art" film fan. if you dig this type of film - check out subconscious cruelty - in my opinion the best art-house/horror film that i've seen. 7/10 for der todesking

what's the best way to start a review of a movie like der todesking? let me start by saying i've just come direct from viewing this movie, and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and i don't think they'll be moving any time soon.it's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it. if not, let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate-budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la "near dark", nor is it a low budget, schlocky, "fun" b-movie. what it is it low-budget art, put forward in a simple yet poignant way. the idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around, and ending in, suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse. sounds simple right, even boring? it isn't. words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through; it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not.i could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction; maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky. i could point out that some of the sound effects are out-of-sync in a way to rival any fulci movie, but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance.as far as extreme movies go, i've seen the hardest of them, and yet der todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed, despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider "gratuitous". in fact, the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale. i won't ruin it, just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise, if not yearn for his end. sure, it's not the best movie ever made, and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish, but in spite of these flaws der todesking is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema. if you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or "nice" movies, or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless, this is not what you're looking for. whether you enjoy it or not, it's one you won't forget in a hurry.

jörg buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times, even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify. they are artistically made, with also often deeper meaning to its themes. this movie is a perfect example of his work.it's also really hard to label this movie. it's not really a movie with a story to it, in a sense of having a beginning, middle and end in it. it also doesn't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings, on 7 different days.all different stories are being told with lots of class, though some of them are of course more 'interesting' and realistic than the others. they are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story. the movie doesn't feel disjointed at all. all different stories have a different feel to it and buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words (also typical for his style) but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story. it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch.again, the production values all aren't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people. it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes.a buttgereit movie that i 'enjoyed' watching.7/10

"der todesking" is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry jörg buttgereit's second cult monument in a row, which is actually a lot better than the infamous "nekromantik", exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated people's suicides. in between these already very disturbing episodes, buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. the episodes aren't all equally powerful but, as a wholesome, "der todesking" is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films. particularly the episodes on wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and the one of sunday, focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead, are extremely intense and devastating to observe. the added value of this film, or any other shockumenary like it, is debatable and i'm not even sure whether or not buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here. there's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically. entirely unlike i expected, "der todesking" isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic! on the contrary actually, i never could have hoped buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery. the thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous german bridge while the names, ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen. the production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema. the subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life. great use of tragic music, too!

my god ! buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen. closer to peter greenaway and jean-luc godard's movies, this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks. all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive, in spite of the lack of money (see the "bridge" sketch). highly highly recommended !

"der todesking"-jorg buttgereit's second full-length feature film(the first one was notorious "nekromantik")has no central character or characters,but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide.divided into days of the week,it comprises of a series of set-pieces,each of which featuring the self-destruction of a complete stranger.yes,the production values are low and it's disturbing,but in many ways "der todesking" is extremely effective.it makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment.unlike the other buttgereit's works it isn't very gory,but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the tuesday episode,a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide.the last(sunday)episode is so depressing and full of pain!-just amazing if you want my opinion.10 out of 10-check out this post-modernism shocker!disturbing art in the purest form!

i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about liebe des totes (the love of the dead) or something similar. this of course awoke my curiosity so i ordered nekromantik 1 & 2 and der todesking (the death king). the nekromantik movies are ok, even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject necrophilia (even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind, they are actually quite funny.)todesking, on the other hand is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. death as an enemy; death as a reliever, death as the very fysical decomposition of the body. the film is a metaphor over life. it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. it reduces its viewers to the childs they (we) actually are. the fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death, and hence neither the process of dying, is the core message of the film. this is a most realistic film. never does buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever. no matter what moral standards you set up, death is unevitable, and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality. this applies to you, dear reader, like it applies to the viewers of the film. some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this, which is fully excused, since they of course will live forever...this is no exploitation movie. why? because death does not exploit us humans. it harvests us. we grow for seven days, then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth, that is death. buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales. whether you choose to regard it as "optimistic" or "pessimistic" is up to you. at first glance it may seem very dark. consider though, that in order for something to live, something else must die. "who wants to live forever?"i believe that when buttgereit shows a body, that are being consumed by maggots, he shows not only decomposition, but generation of new life. is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil, than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre?when you realize this, you see der todesking it its right context.sieben tage hat die woche, siebenmal letzte stunden. seven are the days of week (weak, mortal !), seven times the last hour.dont fear the reaper, buttgereit tells us, because the reaper takes only what is ripe. and apples that are not plucked for food will rot!have a good life, fellow imdb'ers !(and watch this film, that compares only to ingemar bergmans "the seventh seal" in terms of depth and universality)

the author of "nekromantik", jörg buttgereit's second feature film, "der todesking" is a powerful masterpiece. centered around a chain letter originating from a group called "the brotherhood of the 7th day", the movie shows 7 episodes, each consisting of one day during one week, where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it's rounds. do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals, enjoy happy or even remotely "normal" movies or expect a movie to be good only, if it is focused on stage acting.the nihilistic, avant-garde approach of der todesking well explains, why buttgereit's movies in general were banned in germany, their native country of origin, during the 80's and most of the 90's. der todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen, but the meaningless apathy or depression most people's lives consist of in general. buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living, only reasons to stop, and in choosing how and when you die, you can also be the king of death, der todesking.buttgereit's movies are generally difficult to categorize and der todesking is no exception. featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies, "art film" would probably be the closest description every time. der todesking features an original method to shoot, create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene. during one scene, the camera slowly, continuously pans in 360 degree circle, while a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day. during another, buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man, while he dwells in his desperation. during a third, seemingly pleasant scene names, ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on-screen, supposedly warranting the ban in germany for this particular movie.episode movies (and especially this one, as the scenes are only vaguely connected) generally suffer from incoherence, and der todesking is no exception. while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it's consequences or subsequences in all it's variations, there are very powerful episodes, yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material, partly draining the overall power of the movie - still, the the jaw-dropping, immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it's more vague moments back to the status of greatness. the general atmosphere is baffling, awe-inspiring, highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part of.this is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come. not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans, this is a small, different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience. whether it be confusion, amazement or even hate, you aren't likely to be left cold by this, in my opinion the best, achievement of this small indie crew.the main theme of the movie, "die fahrt ins reich der menschentrümmer part i-iii" was released in a limited 666-piece 8" vinyl edition, which is now much sought after. you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting "the nekromantik" soundtrack cd, which i highly recommend. the lo-fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky, almost illbient-like, makes an essential part of the movie's atmosphere, and is something you would very, very rarely hear otherwise. much recommended!

this is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's! i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music. anyway, i love the way the blob looks. i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party. another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night, just like halloween ii.when steve and jane are making out, they see a meteor fall from space. inside the meteor is the blob. whenever the blob consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. can anything stop this blobby creature? i highly recommend the blob!!!

"the blob" qualifies as a cult sci-fi film not only because it launched 27-year old steve mcqueen on a trajectory to superstardom, but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the 1950s. interestingly, nobody in the kay linaker & theodore simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous, scarlet-red protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as "the blob." steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall, the old west bounty hunter in "wanted: dead or alive," after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures' release. meanwhile mcqueen's attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in "the andy griffith show" as sheriff taylor's school teacher girlfriend helen crump. of course, neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers, but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers. director irvin s. yeaworth, jr., made his directorial debut with "the blob." linaker & simonson's screenplay synthesized four genres: first, the alien invasion; second, teenage delinquency; third, a murder mystery, and fourth; a horror chiller. moreover, while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes, it remains largely anonymous. in other words, the eponymous jell-o neither talks nor communicates by telepathy. instead, it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody. the tone of "the blob" is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature.as the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of "the blob," the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci-fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing. jane (anita corsaut) and steve (steve mcqueen) see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it. meanwhile, an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick. the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick. when the old timer (olin howland of "the paleface") gets a closer look at it, the goop attaches itself to his hand. the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy. steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr. hallen in town. hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office. hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation. of course, hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's forearm. hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened. our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve's fast driving. steve fools him into a reverse drive race, but the local police chief dave (earl rowe) lets him off the hook. steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor. after they visit the old man's house and rescue a dog, the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane return to dr. hallen's office. during the interim, the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer, killed hallen's nurse and attacked the doctor. neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor hallen's shotgun have any effect on the blob. steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen. when steve and jane go to the police department to report the incident, dave is frankly incredulous, while sergeant bert (john benson) believes that it is a prank. bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car.steve and jane take them to hallen's office, but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody, but dave admits that the office has been vandalized. against sgt. bert's advice, dave turns the teens over to their respective parents. no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again. they drive into town and spot the old man's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket. when they go to retrieve the mutt, steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens. they find nobody inside, but they encounter the blob. steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them. later, after they escape, steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed. police chief dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket. steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store. about that time, the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers. suddenly, a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve. steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks. the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off.the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob. the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole. as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack, the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark. producer james b. harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo."the blob" proved to be a drive-in hit and steve mcqueen's surge to stardom gave the film added momentum. unless you are a juvenile, this little horror movie isn't scary at all, but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes. they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination, so "the blob" isn't without a modicum of subtlety.

i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start "wanted: dead of alive" the same year this film came out, or be in the magnificent seven two years later, he would not have done it. but he did, and we are the richer for it.sure it's a camp classic. horror the way it was meant to be for the drive-in theater. it's fun and nostalgic.it is interesting that the last lines of the film were:lieutenant dave: at least we've got it stopped. steve andrews: yeah, as long as the arctic stays cold. they never would have imagined 52 years ago that the arctic would be thawing. the blob will soon return.

sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. in my little book, there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor. catch the redoubtable mrs. porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. she not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&w. yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. but except for several of the teens, the non-hollywood cast performs well. then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining. pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". then again, the 27-year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway. the movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. and except for the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. meanwhile, i'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water.

i had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct sicilian tv channel; amazingly, the film emerged as a heftily-priced dvd from criterion: not being sure what i had made of it initially (despite having attained cult status over the years, the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs), i opted not to make the purchase  as i did with the similar and, to me, unfamiliar fiend without a face (1958). recently, however, i managed to acquire the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which, interestingly, ported over the two audio commentary tracks from the criterion "special edition"but, regrettably, i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! anyway, looking at the film anew, i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it (despite many a narrative flaw, which i will get to later)  as a pure example of 'b-movie' schlockiness (atypically shot in pleasant color) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes. the male lead was an early role for steve(n) mcqueen and, though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain, his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging: not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and, more importantly, altruistic) kid. the special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema (showing daughter of horror [1953/7] as i mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence, incidentally, would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called "blob"!). as to the admittedly minor quibbles i have with the film: the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places, never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids' scrapes with police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob  as if fluid, whatever its proportion, can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that, at that stage, only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action)! an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob!; the original was then remade in 1988  i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though i know micheal elliott loves it). for the record, i will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director yeaworth and producer jack h. harris, namely 4d man (1959) and dinosaurus! (1960).

old horror movies are interesting, plenty of screams, plenty of shouts, and plenty of humor to go along with it. "the blob" is a classic in it's own work. steve mcqueen(1930-80) plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town. going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens. but when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky, he ends up being the victim, and steve helps him out the best he can. when its up to teen power, this movie really provides it. i know most teens have had their hardships when they act up, when danger comes around, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. when the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about "the blob" running amok, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them. the oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day, and in my opinion i think it was jell-o! when everyone pitches in to stop the menace, the town is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. i still eat jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like jello, tough! rating 5 stars

some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something: dvd menu system. i tell you the people, i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times. it was awesome. a cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was, which was the very beginning. many times the sum and bam! i was hooked. over and over and over. and over."doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." and that's just the soundtrack! i is laid aside in the bed, curled up with my vaio. the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft. the cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me, is already rested. i popped in the dvd. i was mesmerized. through the night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo."the blob. see it. steve queen, two cops, and one girl in a dress. two thumbs way up!

i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night, not knowing what to expect. i had heard of this movie, but never really any opinions on it.i have to say, i was impressed with what i saw. i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times.the blob was scary looking. now, i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it'll latch itself onto my hand.steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews, the protagonist of the film. i also liked the old man in the beginning.for a 50's horror movie, this was very well done even by today's standards.8/10.

first off, i hadn't seen "the blob" since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience. pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today. and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s "fear of teenagers". but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.sure, it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world. but "the blob" packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don't believe them. in fact, there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world. and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.to sum up, if you can take off your postmodern irony filter, there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye.

this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it. the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor. human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. nobody believes the teens (steeve mcqueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped. it's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast. the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. if you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from '88 as well.

most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid- and some of them, the blob included, scared the daylights outta me. movies like invaders from mars made it all too clear to us "small fry" that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the homeworld; the blob just reiterated that fact. i recall, fondly, late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as body snatchers and martian invaders and blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society. there was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in richmond, virginia) ran an atomic age classic every weekend. these were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "color" print of the blob had faded to a faint pink- but, man, was it fun. i dragged my mother along, and she enjoyed it as much as i did. it was there, at that science museum, that i truly fell in love with the blob. the filmmaker's intent was, of course, to make money- but it was the sincerity of all involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players), that made me fall in love with this movie. corny? you bet. cheesy? they don't get any cheesier. but, man, what a movie!

i've seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's.a strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this. a strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's, where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass. the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. when these incidents are reported to the police, they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up. they finally believe them when the mass, now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming. it then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside. the blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes, which is its weakness. it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the arctic and disposed of there. but it is only frozen, not dead...this movie has a typical setting for its period: teenagers and a small town. the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout.the sequel, beware! the blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of the blob movies.the cast is lead by steve mcqueen (the great escape)and is the movie that made him a star and aneta corsaut plays his girlfriend. i'm not familiar with any of the other stars.the blob is a must see for all sci-fi fans. fantastic.rating: 4 stars out of 5.

i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy. the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects. what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget, locally produced (valley forge pa) christian shorts. let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious. that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits. for what it was meant to be, this film is excellent. i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts, blair witch project was one of them, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. bwp was pure excrement. the blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and thoroughly entertaining. the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy. the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. bottom line is, i love this movie. i challenge anyone out there to take $120,000.00, inflated for today's dollar value, and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob. it just can't be done. period! thank you for taking time to read this review.

this is my favorite classic. it was filmed a little west of philadelphia, pa when i was 13, in 1957, and released the next year. then in 1970, i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper. i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed. i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well, and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the "home of the blob". the theater scene was in phoenixville, near valley forge park and it is still showing films today!

i grew up in royersford, pa. the town where jerry's market was. i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming. i remember a guy showing the "blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie. her hair style was the same as aneta corsaut's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind. they payed her $25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august. my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister.

the blob is a great horror movie, not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable, flesh-dissolving title character, but because it features a real societal message. it is, in many ways, a "feel-good horror film." the clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast. the two romantic leads, steve mcqueen and aneta corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. they are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people, and it's very easy to root for them.this is a pro-society movie, and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom, not out of some malevolent character flaw. steve mcqueen's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings, but quickly joins in mcqueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees mcqueen's seriousness. in this way, a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism.the authorities' initial skepticism of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong--and once the threat is acknowledged by all, all conflict within the society disappears. this unification of purpose, and the validation of the "troublemaking" teens, becomes official when aneta corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the blob. on any other day, breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent--on this particular day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. at this turning point, it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old.this is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a "generation gap" but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and that given a real crisis, people will naturally band together to restore order. "the blob" is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of "night of the living dead" (1968).much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative (and effective!) visual effects. they are undeniably clever. a lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated. the camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly "locked down" position (the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that). these scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned--the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up. in a way, this was similar to stop motion photography, but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet. even today, the effects are startling and bizarre.a very good film with an exploitative-sounding title, the blob is a must-see.

absolutely the very first film that scared me to death. i happened catch it when my older brother(r.i.p.) was watching it. it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested. shortly after, my folks bought a color set and, as luck would have it, the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday.i had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up...and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night! i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space, but you could not hear it, or see it...and once it got hold of you it was too late. even now, after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine. a true classic, and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation!long live the blob!

a meteorite falls in the country of a small town, bringing a jelly creature. an old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and the youths steve andrews (steve mcqueen) and his girlfriend jane martin (aneta corsaut) take him to dr. t. hallen (steven chase). the local doctor treats carefully the blister, and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man. when steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. steve and jane try to warn the police and the dwellers, but nobody believe on them, while the blob engulfs many people, getting bigger and bigger."the blob" is a cult and classic sci-fi. it is a low budget movie, with many ham actors and actresses (with the exception of steve mcqueen), awful effects, but also delightful and very, but very funny. this is the first time that i see this classic (i had seen the 1988 remake with kevin dillon), and i really recommend it to fans of steve mcqueen and sci-fi b-movies from the 50s. the film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "a bolha" ("the blob")

no hidden agenda. pure scifi. all fun.i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad. i was a kid :)the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten. the original one, starring the great movie star steve mcqueen (bullet), is by far the better and only version anyone should see.the movie production is dated, but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time. i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord. 10/10-zafoid

who would think andy griffith's "helen crump" (aneta corsaut) had a steve mcqueen movie in her past? but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie, which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space. the rebel is steven mcqueen (who would shortly decide that "steve" sounded less prissy), a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut. it was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders, but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous, man-eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left. but will the grown ups believe them? of course not, what do they know, they're just kids!the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best. the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many a soulful look into each other eyes, and the "adult" supporting cast probably says "kids!" very third sentence or so. but the real pleasure of the film its creature, which is well imagined, well-executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. and although clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniature sets, guys!), the blob is actually a fairly well-made film--and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure. the 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility, and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated "grown ups only" get together. make plenty of jello cubes for movie snacking! gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

i wasn't aware of steve mcqueen in 1958. i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film. (i'd been devastated by the movie "trantula" at age seven . . . but i was ten now). the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster's attacks. i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office (poor doc), and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience . . . so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors, too huge now to fit through just one. it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve-like diner, he seemed like a sure dinner to be. to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description, but in the end, better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids.i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick, trying to act brave. he knew i was in trouble, and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room, but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor, there the red pulsating, heart-like hungry dude sat, waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom. it took months to recover. i'm 57 years old now . . . i've made it.of course the blob wasn't destroyed.

i look at this page, and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic. sure, i agree to let everyone have their opinion, but here's mine:this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher, and should be seen many casual viewers around the world. sure, it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age, especially in todays world of cgi effects, but that's not why you should like it.you should like it because it actually is a scary movie, even for today's standards. it's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences, so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance. watch it, but not with a critical attitude. watch it to have fun, how it was originally intended.

the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueen's first big starring role.mcqueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece. steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence.later on, mcqueen would say he hated this film and that "he was the blob". but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute, fresh and innocent. would that we all had stayed that way.the plot is fast paced and although predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. and it's really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool (and anita corsaut before she became andy taylor's girlfriend). a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it's a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection.

the blob is a classic 1950s b-movie sci-fi flick. you probably know the story: two teens (steve mcqueen & aneta corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into an old man with some weird...blob attached to his arm. they take him to the doctor's office, and then go to find out what happened. from there, the blob spreads, eating everyone in its path. the special effects are cheesy fun, as is the story. there are a lot of great touches, like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district. it's no masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. steve mcqueen is very good. 8/10.

this movie is wonderful. what separates it from other 50's sci-fi is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, eyes, anything, yet it can't be killed. i especially like the idea that this film doesn't take place over a few days, it takes place in one night, lasting supposedly past midnight.it's also scary that once the blob gets on you, you can't get it off. you're stuck in it, as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. my all time favorite 50's sci-fi film, and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one. i can see why this rocketed steve mcqueen to stardom. all this and a catchy theme song! how can you go wrong?

this movie is of almost generation-defining importance to some of us born in the early post-war years in that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house) you almost certainly saw it. and the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you. it's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days. it had a modern, space-age storyboard for the audiences of it's time. the set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a friday midnight show. it has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in the 'why can't they let us have fun' way rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-a-cause way. all characters were identifiable to us - teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the cops - were sympathetic to us. we could relate to them allit had a singularly horrifying monster. it's first victim is heard moaning 'it hurts.....it hurts' and we were convinced and frightened. the menace grows continually throughout the story. there are intense periods of suspense, colourful effects, a fabulous lead in mcqueen, and moments of humour, both intended and not. it even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying.i saw it in summer, age 9 or so, double billed with 'i married a monster from outer space', and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that i went back a couple more times before it left. everyone i knew saw it. everyone i knew loved it.

generally, i am not a huge fan of stop-motion films and at first ruka didn't capture my attention. however, knowing that this film was made in the repressive czechoslovakia during the soviet-domination era, the more i watched the film, the more i realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was. this subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement.the sad little film is done without any dialog, but it's pretty clear what is happening. a cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot--making it into a sculpture of a hand instead. well, the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing. however, over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man. and, by the end, the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand, in a sign of real hypocrisy, gives the man a hero's funeral! as i said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave jirí trnka to criticize his domineering government. not surprisingly, though czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise, the state (i.e., the hand) banned this little parable. sadly, trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co-called "velvet revolution".

my discovery of the cinema of jan svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of czech animation, of which jirí trnka was a pioneer. his ruka is one of the finest, most technically-impressive animated movies i've ever seen.a potter wakes up and waters his plant. then he goes about making a pot. but in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself. he casts the hand out, but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he's forced to sculpt a stone hand. he sets about it, fainting from exhaustion, but eventually completes the task.in a marvellous sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings, which keep him in thrall, and he escapes back home. he shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head.this movie doesn't hide the fact it's pure animation, unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic (why?). the hand, for instance, is clearly someone's hand in a glove. everything else is clay. strings are visible and are part of the narrative, making it a precursor of the movie strings. the atmosphere is eerie: that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined.the movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity. it's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which can't help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right.

i saw this film when i was a young child on television (thank-you canadian broadcasting corporation) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards.trnka was one of the mentors for bratislav pojar, one of canada's national film board's best animators. pojar was, in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great drouin. if you like trnka you should see "night angel".the symbolism is obvious, but deftly used. the oppositions of beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand. the poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda.what i most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor. the small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world. the invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world.beautiful and haunting film. i found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids. a must see.

jiøí trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism, which caused him trouble in his native czechoslovakia. the elements are few, the symbolisms simple, and his trademark ornaments almost absent here, allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable. a man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant. but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself. the man refuses and he's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand. in these days, where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world, it is refreshing to watch a film, which makes its technique part of the enjoyment.

an absolutely brilliant film! jiri trnka, the master of puppet animation, confronts totalitarianism in this, his final, film. it would be banned by the communist czechoslovakian government (at the time), despite taking the country's highest animation award.in this dark and entertaining short film, an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant. he happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose. all of a sudden, he here's a knock at the door, and in comes this giant omnipotent hand, that tries to force the artist to make statues in it's likeness. the artist resists as best he can, but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts, by the hand, to force him to conform. he becomes brainwashed; an intellectual zombie. at this point the hand attaches strings to the artist, puts him in a cage, and uses him to make hand statues. all the while glorifying the artist's work and awarding him with medals and honours.the artist's inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination, and enables him escape his prison, whether it be literal or in his mind, and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand. he shuts himself in, thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand, but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high, hoping it is out of the reach of the hand, and it ends up falling on his head, killing him. the artist is inevitabally destroyed by his own creation. all because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the hand's strings. once dead, the hand paints the artist as a great person, a national hero. unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered.trnka's condemnation of totalitarian society, and their lack of right for free expression is dark, damning and an amazingly animated. it is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire, and would perhaps even listen to. that was obviously not acceptable. an amazing example of an artists civil disobedience and the impact it can have. and still quite relevant today for many parts of the world, from the us to the middle east. a must see and definite 10 out of 10! talk about going out with a bang!

what great locations. a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens.this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days. good going folks!. i can not wait to see what your next feature will be. i'll be with you all the way.

savage island's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you! trust me.when the boy of the estranged savage family is run over by some city slicker tourists, pa savage wants revenge, and he'll stop at nothing until he gets it.this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments.also, the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film. the filmmakers chose the lighting and camera-work in order to reflect the dark, murky, and egdy mood of the story; in other words, to obtain a certain aesthetic. in fact, the film has won several horror film festival awards.

this is a good film for 99% of the duration. i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim.it is shot in a rather naive fashion. this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique.the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called joe. however, the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott.the film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacks of 'b' movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur. this is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence.after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed. i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film.give it a watch and excuse the ending!

i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it. it actually exceeded my expectations. considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways, especially given the plot. just like the blair witch project, this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film. another bonus: whereas most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre-to-unintentionally hysterical acting, this film actually had a talented cast (save one or two characters), particularly the two leads. the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline. it borrows heavily from better-known films like "deliverance" and "wrong turn" but if you're like me, films of this nature never cease to be terrifying. plus, the director keeps things interesting throughout. i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out...

very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.the script was very good as was the acting. the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film. this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending. i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever. this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good.

who ever came up with story is one sick person. i rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we're all in an acting class together, and we know a couple of the actors from class. besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night, i had freaky nightmares. i kept thinking oh my god, if i get up to go to the bathroom to pee i'm going to be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something. i couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie. i also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we don't any of the boys units? you should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and chopping off units. i would watch that over and over. call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. i'm only giving this movie a 9 because you freaked me out freaks.

i think this movie had to be fun to make it, for us it was fun to watch it. the actors look like they have a fun time. my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors. not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make. i see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more, or more because we laugh together. if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them. the grander mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man. he make us laugh together the most. i would give this movie a high score if you ask me.i don't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors, but the main boy is cute. the actor with the grand chest has to be not real. they doesn't look to real.

this is actually a groovy-neat little flick, made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness . it takes a little while to warm up to it. the acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen-like charm. after a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries. the characters all develop a quirky charm, especially "richard". forget anthony hopkins, maidens is the guy i'd hire to play a raving psychopath. he just seems to enjoy it so very much! mixed in with the scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character, "the midnight skater" zooming through the campus in a black hoodie, looking for all the world like a cross between the grim reaper and, say, the silver surfer. these shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the skater seem almost ominous. the soundtrack features some very fun garage-punk tunes and the raspy, raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film's mood. thumbs upish, i say.

b movie? yes. diy? yes. first movie? yes. but aestheically a+. this movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc. etc. problems. however, this movie has many positive things about it. first off, the most annoying character dies first! second, its made to be a parody/funny b rated horror movie. the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing.the problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece. take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie. for what it is, just that, it is really good.

what does the marquis de sade have to do with egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults? tobe hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film.genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in alexandria, egypt. genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker (and blatant lesbian) who services daddy on the side. daddy gets sent back to the site, where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it. genie meets a descendant of the marquis de sade, and falls for a hunky egyptian (providing the film's hottest scenes). eventually, genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going. wrapped around this story is footage of the marquis de sade in prison, talking to a portrait of what looks like genie.robert englund is terrific as both the marquis and his descendant. his acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements, so he is allowed to shine here. his best performance is still in "killer tongue," if you have not seen that yet.the rest of the cast, including young genie, are pretty and average. the script, however, is problematic. you will quickly learn that the marquis scenes are completely unnecessary, except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set. the mermaid cult that eventually saves genie makes no sense whatsoever. who the mermaid is is never explained, and its link to christianity (which is hyped throughout the film) is nothing. the film is very anti-christian, as the archaeologist is a bible spouting father, but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute. there are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence, but hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say. i know i have no idea.so why am i recommending this film? it is weird. there is an extended sex scene. for the ladies, hunky egyptian rides a horse completely nude. englund is marvelous. do you like snakes? this film is full of them. this is like roger corman with a bigger budget. knowing hooper somehow came up with "crocodile" after this is rather sad. "night terrors" is not perfect, but definitely worth a winking, unserious look.this is rated (r) for physical violence, some sexual violence, gore, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references, and drug abuse.

i'd read about flavia the heretic for many years, but i only got to see it early last year, when i went on an insane movie-buying binge, and, for whatever reason, it has been on my mind lately, though it's been some months since i watched it.it's a striking film, set in italy somewhere around the 15th century. definitely medieval-era (though i don't think any specific year is ever given). this being the time of christian ascendancy, the age is a time of utter madness, and the movie captures this very well.flavia, our protagonist, is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield. he seems a warm and intriguing fellow, and she's immediately taken with him. her father, a soldier of a a family of some standing, comes along, almost immediately, and murders the wounded man right before her eyes. but she'll continue to see him in her dreams.her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents, so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity, slowly go mad. flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. but in a mad world, only the sane are truly mad, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her. her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia, who, being young and apparently sheltered, is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped.the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world, showcasing a lot of unpleasantness. we see a horse gelded, a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig-sty, the pious torture of a young nun. through it all, flavia observes and questions, rejecting, eventually, the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic. i disagree with that criticism. flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror, for example, then-contemporary feminist commentary (the movie was made in 1974), revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions. it is, perhaps, difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time, but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor. flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era, or of any era, to empathize with her plight. getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees.flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive, invading the countryside, and she finds, in their leader, a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams. smitten with her almost immediately, he allows her to virtually lead his army, becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle-gear, and directing the invaders to pull down christian society, and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil.is she the herald of a new and better world? she may think so, but muslims of that era weren't big on feminism, either, as she soon learns the hard way. as they say, meet the new boss...this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic. the movie is quite grim, and with a very downbeat, rather depressing ending. not a mass-audience movie at all, to be sure. it's quite good, though, and doesn't belong on the "nunsploitation" pile on which it is often carelessly thrown. i think there's much value in the final film, and i'm glad i saw it.

post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism.spoiler alert! this underrated gem of a film tells the story of flavia, a fifteenth century girl of noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of medieval christian society by viewing a fallen islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure.unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent (explicitly stated in a scene where the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks) flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and, through butting up against a whole system of subjugation, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her.billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth. this is a film depiction the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal dominance, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit.i described it in the title of this piece as 'post-feminist' and in the end flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by men. even flavia's gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men (the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror.as to the much discussed violence: this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess. to have shied away from the violence would have limited the film's impact, would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse it is exposing. in addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society.beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted (notably by florinda bolkin and maria casares), containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years flavia is a classic of european cinema.

expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges, flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated.it actually has a feminist storyline, though i don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set. it certainly wasn't practiced. women (and the jews and the poor) are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society. throughout the story, sister flavia (florinda bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it, albeit with disastrous results.the pre-credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. she sees an injured "evil" muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to assist him. before she can, her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). after this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. though scenes do involve violence, rape and nuns, i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation. indeed, many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there, but the acting, camera-work, storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level. most "nun" films i've seen usually have the basic premise of: a good girl somehow winds up in a convent, where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell.flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her. much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited (but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me, but it's a lot easier for guys) sister agatha. when a group of muslims attack their abbey, flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns. their attackers actually function as their liberators (of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey). in fact, it is a christian, not a muslim invader, that impales dear sister agatha. it is agatha's death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her... her father treats her like dirt. her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time. i don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. this is a great film, so don't be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic. plus, how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong? i am not familiar with maría casares' other works, but sister agatha is a hell of a character.i have read many great reviews of the synapse (us) release, but i love my german x-rated kult dvd copy. it isn't anamorphic/16:9, but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse's release.and there are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many from sister agatha)"why is god male? the father, the son, and the holy spirit they're all male!" -flavia"these men are afraid- look at them, sister- afraid their power will be taken away from them!" -sr. agatha (regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive)"woman, where are you going? the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians haven't done! ha ha ha!" -sr. agatha (to a group of fleeing christian women)"lord bless these moslems- for putting fear into these pompous christians." -flavia"does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you $h!t your underclothing?" -sr. agathaclosing message: "flavia gaetani, not yet a muslim - no longer a christian - was punished as a runaway nun. the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the 800 at otranto"

"flavia, la monaca muslmana" aka. "flavia the heretic" of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that, to a certain extent, follows a somewhat feminist premise (though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists). set mostly in a convent, and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist (great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan), "flavia the heretic" may be referred to as a 'nunsploitation' film. however, this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time, as it doesn't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism, sadistic lesbian punishments, etc. personally, i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time, such as "mark of the devil", (even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witch-hunts), which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period.italy around 1600: after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier, young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent. when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later, falvia's disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church, and she joins a band of arabic scavengers...one thing is for sure, "flavia the heretic" is not for the faint-hearted, and neither is it for those who want happy endings. director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible, especially in its nasty scenes. the many torture- and execution-scenes are extremely disturbing, with skinnings, spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail, the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film. the violence here is never superfluous, however. after all, this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in. the film is very well-made, with realistic costumes, fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani. the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult-productions (including lucio fulci's giallo-masterpiece "non si sevizia un paperino" of 1972). she delivers another great, charismatic performance here, and i couldn't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does. the film has some minor inconsistencies (e.g. why does the rigid church let bizarre cult-followers into convents in the first place). however, it is overall amazing how realistic this film is. "flavia the heretic" should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema. this is a great exploitation flick overall, though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood. highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema. 7.5/10

there is so much that can be said about this film. it is not your typical nunsploitation. of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but that is almost incidental to the story.it is set in 15th century italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto. the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film. it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards, that the mother superior would ask, "why do you fear the muslims,; they will not do anything that the christians have done to you?" certainly, there was enough torture on both sides.sister flavia (florinda bolkan) is sent to a convent for defying her father. in the process, she witnesses and endures many things: the gelding of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect, and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew. the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun, and her nipples cut off.sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives. she even asks jesus, why the father, son and holy ghost are all men.eventually, she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent. here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time. but, tragedy is to come. she manages to exact sweet revenge on all, including the duke and her father, but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same. she is a woman and that is all there is to it.i won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end, but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decades.nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.

flavia the heretic is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre - equal parts sleaze, feministic journey, and "history" as we follow flavia on her strange trip.we start off with flavia in a convent...she ain't too happy there cuz she doesn't believe in all the male-dominated "rules" and macho-ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal, abraham. they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another "non-believing" nun in hastening a moslem invasion. flavia hangs out with the moslems who take over the convent and get "busy" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. eventually the moslems roll-out and flavia is punished as a traitor to christianity in another singularly brutal scene...this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70's era exploit film - some good gore, including nipple-removal, and a nice leg-skinning scene, some decent nudity - including the requisite full-frontal, and a decent storyline as well. i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points, but not enough to get truly bored with it. i would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit/70's exploit fans...8/10

too many sources routinely lump this thought-provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar "nunsploitation" which was a mainstay in '70s euro trash cinema, overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor. perhaps coincidentally it was also director gianfranco mingozzi's singular attempt at narrative film-making outside of many well-received documentaries.safely set within a historical context, flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century italian nun (florinda bolkan's career performance, even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulci's devastating don't torture a duckling), locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's budding sensuous nature. wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture, she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives, inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semi-crazed older sister agatha (indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casarès from marcel carné's les enfants du paradis) and - more constructively - by a muslim invasion. joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding, flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be, with expected tragic results.with its breathtaking widescreen compositions by alfio contini, who shot michelangelo antonioni's zabriskie point, this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman's fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remarks. a lengthy drug-induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russell's otherwise far more flamboyant devils notwithstanding, the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department, making something of a mockery out of its semi-porn reputation. this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation.

flavia(florinda bolkan of "don't torture a duckling" fame)is locked away in a convent of carnal desires by her father.tired of all of the sadism she sees around her(rape of a young woman in a pigsty,sexual cravings,horse castration)flavia decides to run from the convent with her jewish friend from the outside,abraham.the two don't get very far before they are captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced to repent.after punishment she joins up with a band of muslims called the tarantulas,who had invaded the convent prior and leads a crusade that turns into nothing short of a bloody battle behind the convent walls."flavia the heretic" is a well-directed and fairly notorious piece of italian nunsploitation.the film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at times.the acting is great and the characters are well-developed.overall,"flavia the heretic" is a genuinely moving and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and gore.you can't go wrong with it.8 out of 10.

reportedy based on actual historical events, this disturbingly violent, bloody, and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era. ms. bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force. her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences: her witnessing of the hated local duke's casual rapist activity, her forbidden love affair with a jew, her criminal defection to the invading moslem forces of the sensual prince ahmed (anthony corlan) there are some painfully realistic gory sequences (human flaying) in this film that are not for the squeamish, but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest. deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to hollywood depictions of the medieval world.

flavia the heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro-exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored. this is an intelligent and complex film, beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate! this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well. flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent, forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent. she refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this. after a fruitless attempt to escape, she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty muslims into the walls of the convent.flavia is a downright mesmerizing film! almost impossible to believe that director gianfranco mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing. i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer-feminism more intensely than flavia does. several sequences are quite shocking (on the verge of nightmarish, actually) as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes, torture and mutilation. yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds, mind you. i'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement 'flavia' is trying to communicate: humanity (the catholic church in particular) historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further. films like "flavia, the heretic" have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and i truly admire them for it. flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance, but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography, the glorious costumes & scenery and a breathtaking musical score by nicola piovani. florinda bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it's maría casares who steals the show as sister agatha. she's a man-hating and loud-mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field! amen, sister!

deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser. in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.technically superb horror comedy(?) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but lets just say its pretty gruesome. if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film. personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level. here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies.. its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on-as revealed in the end-i want to go back and see what it was i didn't catch on to. there is an internal logic rare in these films.7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs, its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else.

some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous, but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them, this is also a film a film of an acquired taste! my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the thing' i.e the parasitical aliens from outta space, infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible!you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre, however cleverly maintains its own originality, well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival! only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host! to then pick another fight with another infected host! and this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away.great! but like i said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the film. it is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty, with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons, i.e saws, drills, blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent. i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next!so if you like gore, you like aliens, you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere, then i must recommend this film as a must see. i just wish i came across this earlier then i did!

why aren't more films (especially american) more like meatball machine? this is my first official on-line review and i am charged with "electrical ecstasy" after having chosen "meatball machine" as my first endeavor. this is a review, so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion.i mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo! so what if it's not all original? i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. meatball machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. thank you jesus for japanese cinema!simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so. i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. this time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring.in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! there's more!!! fight scenes!! great music!! great point-of-view shots! decent acting by the woman cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times.oh, and did i forget to mention it's a love story! wow, i hate love stories but this takes the cake!i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. sadly, i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine. the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine.lastly, my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. normally she says something like "why are you watching that junk?" this time she had nothing to say. i was glad! this is not junk. this isn't just splatter (splatter for the sake of splatter is also great). this is art my friends. art.chacho

for fans of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you! there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film, also the effects can be impressionable and awesome. the plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days.also notable are the little aliens, who i found cute. all in all, it's a good film for fans of the genre. also recommended are films such as tetsuo:the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach, filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed. of course, seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two.

most of the feedback i've heard concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed. a couple even saying that they think "it sucked". well, to those people i say, get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself. this was a very entertaining flick.the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gwar-costume looking, deathbots called necroborgs. eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you, which then is able to control your actions due to hot-wiring your nervous system. unfortunately for two love-seeking lonely young adults, they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug, and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered. is there a way to stop the transformation? maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? why do the necroborgs fight one another? do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty? only one way to find out.going into meatball machine i was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions, but it turned out being a great surprise. a few unanswered questions, some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of. from the anime feel to it, to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel, this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses. with a ever-developing story that's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make-up effects and blood splatter, this is one flick fans of bizarro/horror/tetsuo/splatter fans should check out. 8 outta 10

wow baby, this is indeed some fine asian horror/gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and guts, there is a bizarre love story. it's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs. the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human, is they need to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that, with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun. the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's "the thing" in creature design and effects. i would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds, as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore. and a must-have for stoners, because you don't even need to read the sub-titles, the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip. the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter's movies, which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour. "meatball machine" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and i simply loved it.

don't be fooled by the silly title folks, this is one sweet ride! a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer, this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll. it seems that aliens are taking over people's bodies and modifying them into war-machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species. the winner of the battle eats the loser alive. that's mostly it for plot, but who cares when the gore is this good? i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used, but it's disgusting to behold. there is interesting and effective use of stop-motion when the takeovers are in progress, and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make-up effects. the cgi is a bit limited, but that actually doesn't detract from the overall quality one bit, at least for me. this was truly a fun and stomach-turning film that deserves much praise, and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics. find it and watch, you won't be disappointed!

the japanese cyber-punk films have never really done a whole lot for me, but of the handful that i've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. meatball machine is no exception.the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts, takes control of their bodies, turns them into "necroborgs", and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of said parasites. the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other, but whose love-affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites, and are forced to fight each other. it becomes a test of human-will vs. the parasite's control over their physical bodies...meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo (as most cyber-punk films are), and for good reason. there are definitely some thematic parallels, though the films are definitely different. there's plenty of fun, splattery moments in meatball machine, and the creature/borg fx are definitely the high-point - a mixture of tetsuo-meets-gwar that are both elaborate and inventive. depending on your taste for these types of films, meatball machine may or may not be your thing. if you enjoy hyper-kinetic cyber-punk films with a healthy dose of splatter - this one's for you...7/10

meatball machine is an amazing splatter film, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood, and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines.now the film isn't for everyone, people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo: the iron man will applaud it.the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film, but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously.yet, all in all it's a lot of fun, well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles.

i don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of " tetsuo " or not . why " tetsuo " ? because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious " tetsuo " rip - off . the concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors .there is lot more gore , less eroticism and , in the case of " meatball machine " , the transformation of human being into a creature that's partially a machine( sounds familiar ? ) called " necroborg " ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens .these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . they infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs . their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eat it .all in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn't expect much , but at the end i actually enjoyed this film .as i said before , this is a low budget flick , but it's still relatively decent . don't expect much from actors , they're mostly not very good , but it can be tolerated . i liked the atmosphere and gore , certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . although the story is not too original , it possesses certain charm - to me at least .7 out of 10 .

directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi (battlefield baseball) and jun'ichi yamamoto "meatball machine" is apparently a remake of yamamoto's 1999 movie with the same name. i doubt i'll ever get a chance to see the original so i'll just stick commenting on this one. first of what is "meatball machine" ? a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. it's not something you'll end up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema."meatball machine" follows the well known plot. boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. boy finally meets girl. girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save his love. will he succeed? who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death i'm satisfied.the plot is simple, relatively clichéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. and yes it too luckily shows more violence. i'm happy. acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. it's not exactly painful for the ears but it's not exactly good either.the movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like i haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. done by keita amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. the necroborgs as they are called in "meatball machine" look stunningly detailed. without the usage of cgi amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are a-movie class."meatball machine" is "tetsuo the iron man" mixed up with "alien" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. it's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.

a fantastic show and an unrealized classic; the league of gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times.with a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired, formulaic approach of it's inferior, yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor, little britain, the league of gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in british comedy.up until it's arrival on the scene, there had never really been anything like the league of gentlemen before. on the surface, a seemingly simplistic sketch show, the show soon unfolds as a vivid, sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations. what really sets the show apart from it's rivals, is it's approach to telling us it's story. rather than serve us re-hashed sketches, barely distinguishable from the next, here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines. no visit to them is the same, and each time they offer us up with a surprise.gradually, over three series' and a christmas special, the fictional town of royston vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace. and that's probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch (and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series') unlike other current shows like the catherine tate show or more importantly little britain, the league both know when a character has run it's course, and have the opportunity to deal with that. several fan favorite's, who could have easily been kept on to entertain further, bowed out before the series came to a close, giving room for fellow characters to grow more, or allow for the introduction of newer residents of royston vasey to make their mark.another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence. as mentioned before, all four members of the league have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations, and when it's time to call it quits in respect to certain characters. this awareness has also meant the league of gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution, not usually seen in a show of this nature. the narrative driven, and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series' and this bold move by the league really pays off. with the third series, there's less of an urgency for them to please an audience, and like the christmas special, they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative, unlike the more sketch-based previous series' that (succesfully) binded together various sets of sketches into a series' long story arc.the third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style, as well as a real treat for fans who've already seen the first two. despite some polarized opinion on the third series, any real fan of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer, as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes, that only delve deeper into fan favorite's, but pair up and inter-wine characters that might not have crossed paths previously.it might take a little trying to get into the change in style, but it's definitely worth it, and in my opinion, the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series.the show's not without it's drawbacks, and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place, but for the most part, the genius writing, dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters (that are often all too close to real life) make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent, catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame

the town of royston vasey is a weird, but wonderful place. the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well. most people will know others with a touch of some characters, but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as tubbs and edward, the stranger-hating owners of the local shop, or the pen-obsessed pauline who treats "dole scum" with much contempt.that was only a few of the strange inhabitants. the tv works consists of 3 series and a christmas special. there are references to many horror films, such as the wicker man. a more recent addition to the range of works is a film, the league of gentlemens apocalypse, of which i will not say much but highly recommend. all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters. i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it!

one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain. mark gatiss,reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy. ably supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson, they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. little britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas. consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on log. i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will reserve judgement.the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became. i don't know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird englishness of the humour

i can't believe it's been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror. this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor: dr. terrible's house of horrible; garth marenghi's darkplace; the mighty boosh; snuff box. many have imitated this show's style, and i don't deny some have surpassed its quality. but jermy dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend, with actors mark gatiss, steve pemberton, and reece shearsmith.together they created royston vasey, a sinister small town in england's idyllic countryside, where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers; where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center; where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows; where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure; where a gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on.this is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen. by themselves, the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters. the make up and prosthetics are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were. but it's also great acting: the way they change their voices and their body movement, the really become other people.most of the jokes start with something ordinary, from real life, and then blows up into something unsettling, sometimes gut-wrenching. sometimes it's pure horror without a set up, like in papa lazarou's character. just imagine a creepy circus owner on make-up barging into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives. no explanation given. it's that creepy. then there are the numerous references to horror movies: se7en, the silence of the lambs, nosferatu, the exorcist, etc.fans of horror will love it, fans of comedy will love it. as any traveler entering knows, there's a sign there that says 'welcome to royston vasey: you'll never leave.' any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree. once you discover the league of gentlemen, you'll never want anything else, you'll never forget it.

this is probably the best television show i've ever seen. i first saw it on comedy central several years ago. at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order, and having just watched all three series in order and unedited (thank you internet and your wondrous "series of tubes") i am so glad i rediscovered it! i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a "season"......and i tried to get friends and family to watch it, but nobody really seemed to like it (i need new friends). so, on my own, i made the best out of it that i could. even when i felt like it was waning a bit, i still felt compelled to continue watching. years after when i discovered little britain, i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters. also, i love the idea of writers who act the entire show....(not new, but done impeccably here). lb has nothing on log! (no offense, matt & david....love you)! this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius. serial murder, implied cannibalism.....you name it and it's probably found in this wonderful, unique piece of tv art. the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vasey.....you'll never leave! i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs, but each character as portrayed has it's own "charm". my least favorite was papa lazarous, that was until he re-surfaced in series three (clever and wholly unexpected)! it's best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before, becomes so compelling (while repulsing) that you really can't stop watching. this is not for those with weak stomachs, kids, conservatives or grandma (unless you've got one saucy granny)! i have always loved british tv, particularly comedies, from monty python to benny hill, red dwarf to keeping up appearances, absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office (but not their us counterparts....sorry). this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between what's funny and what's just sick and twisted. nothing, nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment. us broadcast tv is so sad and lame, i can barely stand to watch any of it. it's kind of sad that even our cable channels don't have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem (your loss, comedy central). thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the "across the pond" that redeem the entire medium every decade or so. basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently "crossing lines" with more graphic sexual content, drug use and adult language, but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life, adult behavior (instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up, sheesh, it's like the same basic show format for the past 35 years)! don't even get me started on us sitcoms! waste of time and lots of wasted money......did you know that "according to jim" has been on the air for 10 years??? 10 years?? anyway... watch this show, get it on dvd, do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well! you've never seen anything like it. there are three specials that i have not watched yet....i'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits. he'll watch them, even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement! lines and lines and lines and lines! note that series three departs from one and two....the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters, the laugh track is gone (thank bloody hell), the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey. don't be thrown by any of that as by the end, the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two. i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable. brilliant, confident and absolutely demented. you will want to re-watch it again and again. it's amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight-gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close-up facial expression. if ever i were to meet any of the writer/performers, i'd implore them not to recreate it or try to top it.....i'd just say "can i help you at all?" (then they'd probably slap me, so i'd ask them to sign the slap-mark)! 10 out of 10

the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. so much so, it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk, many of which have copied the style, but have never succeeded.unlike every other sketch show around, the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected. firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey, in the back of beyond of northern england. the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad, the pig-faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence. other oddities include: the denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and toads; hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat; pauline, a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; mr. chinnery, kind-hearted vet and menace to all things four-legged; geoff tipps, a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour, often involving guns, electric tubes and . . . . . . . plums!!!!! despite being a comedy at heart, the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people's material. there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds. even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic, vulnerable light. the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide they belong local.the equally underrated third series also takes a different route, instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van. although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they're certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be, and how unafraid to explore new areas.in short, the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look, as like the welcome signs says: you'll never leave!

about a year ago i finally gave up on american television. i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office, extras, blackadder, and the league of gentlemen. it was then that i decided to switch to british television. among all the shows listed above, the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all, providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i've seen yet. characters included are the most unhappily married couple, a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid (probably for the best), a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people, and the worst veterinarian ever. this program is one of the best i've seen.

i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family. funnily enough, my girlfriend lives in hadfield (the filming location) and she pointed out a few landmarks when i first visited.this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch. besides recognising some of the locations, i found myself not in the least bit surprised. once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world. tlog easily ranks up there with red dwarf, fawlty towers and monty python as probably the best.suffice to say i am hooked on the program now. the characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge. the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north (no disrespect to hadfield which i have found a very welcoming and warm place).i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run (which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the uk last night, it certainly is).well done the bbc!!

i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television: since then, i have never missed an episode.it's humour is very weird, like a cross between brass eye's social commentary, the fast show's excellent one-liners, and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere. the best example of this was hillary briss's special stuff - what was that all about?the humour will not appeal to all. some will say it's just too sick, and it's easy to see where they're coming from. nonetheless, give it a try. if you don't like it, don't watch it, but if you do like it you'll be very glad you took my advice.

this is what makes me proud to be british. this is by far the funniest thing on tv. the league consists of jeremy dyson, steve pemberton, mark gatiss and the lovely reece shearsmith. totally underrated, this horror-comedy is perfection. the characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre, "hello dave". it is a comedy that everyone simply must watch.the best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh, and always pushing the boundaries. it does not need to rely on catchphrases(unlike little britain) for it to be funny. the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they've got balls of steel.

well, i just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than "little britain" and i like it! "the league of gentlemen" is a sick british comedy that is about the most awful, insane and disgusting small town in all the uk. this place makes dibley and craggy island (from "the vicar of dibley" and "father ted") seem pretty normal!! the format of the show is a lot like little britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this one hellish town. both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired "little britain" (particularly the job seeking class skit). but the show differs because although it is crude like "little britain" (hence not a show for kids), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows. in particular, animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show.now if you haven't guessed, this is not a show for kids, the easily offended or normal people and that's probably why i liked it. however, you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max. funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief--you have to see it to believe it.

another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks, also aptly. yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non-critically and black comedy, also well worth consideration.watch the whole thing, all three series. at the end, all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel. the detail and intricacies are staggering. thoroughly post-modern. wickedly funny, and startlingly tragic. not for kids. not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity. thought-provoking. at once literal, figurative, and surreal in disturbing ways. the blackest comedy i can recall.and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see.

this series premiered on the cable tv station "comedy central" in the united states. it was chopped to death, and shown out of sequence. this was sad for the audience it should have attracted, it didn't and fell by the wayside. luckily, at the same time my cable company went digital and i got the bbc. thank goodness because i got to see "the league of gentlemen" in order, complete and uncut. "the league of gentlemen" troupe is right up there with england's "monty python's flying circus" and canada's "the kids in the hall". but..a warning."the league of gentlemen" though are one step beyond. it's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills, it goes deeper and much, much, darker. i can tell many of you now -- it will offend certain groups of people, it will enrage others. but remember, its only comedy..dark, dark comedy. if that is not your thing, don't watch. if you think you know dark comedy, watch this -- if you get angry and upset, then you don't quite know dark comedy. these guys got it right, and right on the button. they are brilliant, they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation. there's a complete story that is told here from episode one to the end. you cannot watch this one episode at a time, willy nilly, that is one of the charms of this series. watch it in order. see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are. no one and nothing is out of bounds. that, my dears, is "dark humor". bravo!

the plot is real horrific, the atmosphere really depressive, unusual for a low-budget production like that, and at least, for a german production. a little bit of indian spirituality, mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together. the development of plot and characters are great, the sets very close to reality, without any studio-atmosphere. it could be perfect, but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing, what don't inevitably have to be typically for low-budget movies:1.) the cast sometimes is not more than average. almost every actor look like a layman. some of them do a good, or a very good job, but some are acting like the actors of crappy german court-shows! but i was very, very disappointed of the acting of mathieu carrière! his acting ( in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine ) here was below-average! but that could be the reason, why he today takes part in crappy german soaps or tv-series on private channels.2.) the dialogs are sometimes on soap-opera-level. 3.) the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand, what the characters are saying. i saw it on dvd and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again. it caused by the set ( big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group ) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors!but all in all, it is an interesting movie, worth to watch it, far beyond the commercially movies, which are often more terrible.

this movie has its ups and downs, but to me the good stuff in this movie very much outweighs the bads...what's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue, the sounds, the lighting(am i the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur, and the acting....what is very good are the highly original storyline, the very intense atmosphere, the gore factor which is very high, and the effects which are done supremely.so, definitely worth watching, or maybe even a must-see for all you horror and gore fans....

tears of kali is an original yet flawed horror film that delves into the doings of a cult group in india comprised of german psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be "healed" through radical techniques (that can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to release the pent-up demons inside them.the film is shown as a series of vignettes about the taylor-eriksson group--the above-mentioned cult group. the first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film. the rest of it plays out like a mindf@ck film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix (full-frontal nudity, some gore) to keep you happy.i say check this out. may not be spectacular, but it's concept is pretty neato and it delivers in the right spots. 8/10.

its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me tears of kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. an anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional taylor-eriksson group, a cult of sorts based in india whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. with bookend segments set in india the film is made chiefly of three stories set in germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the taylor-eriksson group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place or even personality. good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. previous to this story we have seen lars eriksson and notably his wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient. the lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like erikssons. there are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others. there is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that i did on wikipedia). writer/director andreas marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film. as well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of bharti india and panama john has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, michael balaun as a sinister doctor and cora chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. the third story also has a fine turn from veteran mathieu carrière as a faith healer. the biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. so, the film isn't quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the pacing too, but mostly i thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance. well worth a look for adventurous horror fans i think.

one of the best low budget movies from germany! is this is the dark side of new age? if you believe in esoteric, please don't watch this movie! it blows all your positive fantasies away. this movie shows that beyond the peaceful façade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror. i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon! andreas marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, making movies with a few euros! i'm waiting for the second hit!

this is a trio of tales, "shakti", "devi", and "kali", about an experimental commune (or some such thing) called the taylor-eriksson group, which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown, and left a bit of damage here and there, i'd say. many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself. shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed. seems this woman is able to project some inner demon, or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". he's a skinhead, a speed freak, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune, which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire. this is probably the best of the three segments. kali tells the tale of a healer, who attempts to "heal" this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did it or if she loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer. all three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness. this has a sort of low-budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout, much to its credit. i watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares (and gore) came it hit pretty hard. i found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot. a good little find, this one, i'd give it 8 out of 10.

three horror stories based on members of a transgressive hindu cult that return home but changed in some way. in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult. somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other. reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants. what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story. things get quite bloody.second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy. the patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task. again, things slow down a bit and get weird. then there's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising.final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands. one of the patients is a former cult member, so the successful healing gets more complicated. again, we are surprised by a twist. has a pretty gory scene in there.there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason. i found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath.note: review of the german dvd.

i saw this movie on the bifff festival in brussel, spring 2004. what a surprise! this german production, a stylish and imaginative shocker, is one of the scariest flic i have seen. be warned: this is not a joke! this terrorizer has a big cast of good actors (as an example:peter martell as a european guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, nice production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movies in the eighties. flesh ripped clean to the bone...and the blood runs red ...this savage heart stopper will grip you...and give you some dark dreams ... a must-see!!

i had initially heard of tears of kali a while back and it sounded like something i'd be into, but with all the films i have coming in on a regular basis, it kinda fell off my radar. while roaming around the local wonderbook...i spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up. i have to say i'm pretty glad i did. tears of kali is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch.tears of kali centers around the fictional india-based taylor-erikkson cult group, that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's "inner demons" - but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough (depending on your viewpoint...) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed upon hapless victims.the film is told "anthology-style", with a short but memorable and "eye-opening" intro sequence, and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film.the first (shakti) is about a journalist who visits one of the cult-members who is being held at a mental hospital. the journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the taylor-erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home. when the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head...the second part (devi) concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma. we find that the treating doctor in question is actually a taylor-erikkson "alumni", and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm...the closing story (kali) revolves around a quack "faith-healer" and his assistant who perform "miracles" for a fee. when the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her, the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host...i gotta say i really enjoyed tears of kali. there are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is. my biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue. the dubbing is sub-par and i would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track. some reviewers have said the acting is poor, which i don't necessarily agree with. i think that the dubbing is so lack-luster that it makes the performances seem stunted, which isn't really the case. in fact, a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling (the "doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third readily come to mind...) and notable. the gore fx are very well done for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-via-cuticle-scissors, a pencil-in-the-throat-suicide, some decent (but irritatingly "shaky") self-flaying, and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure. not as rough as some of the more "extreme" gore films out there, but definitely stronger than your average horror fare. i also found the story concerning the cult-group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror-story nonsense. there are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the likes of which i haven't come across in a while. although flawed in some fundamental ways, i still think tears of kali will appeal to most "underground" horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer. definitely recommended - 8.5/10

i'll be honest with you...i liked this movie. it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but is also packed with bad zombie effects. part iv, entitled "after death" is also good. i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.10 out of 10fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master, skinned alive, slumber party massacre, sleep away camp, and other full moon pictures flicks. for other recommendations, check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section.

this movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.just remember this: when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies... be they good or bad... this is the formula that they are using. this is what makes zombie movies so great.and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know.all in all, it doesn't linger. there's never a point where you think to yourself "c'mon, get on with it"... it moves quick and corners nicely. this is the sporty, little italian number of zombie flicks.so awful, it's wonderful! if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it.as a great trivia note: if you're watching it on dvd, you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... well... that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop.

nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie-flicks, but  honestly  why would we bother? every single film in the zombi-"series" delivers great fun, nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and "zombi 3" is no exception to this, despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting. this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project, who had to elaborate further on his "zombi 2" success, but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films. the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every ingenious idea from george a. romero's "night of the living dead" and "the crazies" is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at. yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything! on a secret army base at the phillipines, scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus "death one" and prepare it for transport. after a failing attempt to steal the virus, the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie-ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village. the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's "nightmare city". truly bad...but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations. the undead birds were original, for example, and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well. the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick. recommended to the fans; don't mind the negative reviews.

we have high expectations with this one . . . because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci . . . however . . . its co-directed by bruno mattei (from night of the zombies) and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso (night of the zombies) and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies (hell of the living dead) a lot. as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2. fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi (?) and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic . . . zombi 3 is not magical . . . its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter. but over the years, i've grown to accept zombi 3. i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room . . . there was a senseless fulci-cut and the mattei/fulci-cut is the one on dvd.

wow this was a great italian "zombie" movie by two great director's luci fulci ("zombie") and bruno mattie ("hell of the living dead") lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen "hell of the living dead" directed by bruno mattie and if you saw "zombie" directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great "zombie" make-up witch equals great looking "zombies" has a funny "zombie" flying head!and "zombie" birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a "zombie" (that only happed to two people) but they are mainly just the great toxic "zombies" like in bruno matties "hell of the living dead".so if you like italian "zombie" movies or just "zombie" movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian "zombie" movie!

a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised. soldiers are able to retrieve the case, but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out. they eventually make it to where he's hiding, and "cleanse" the hotel and its occupants. unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation, and if you've seen return of the living dead, you know what happens next.zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike, as a complete mess of a movie. while that's a fair assessment, it's not without it's high points. for one thing, it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy. there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible. they're in the water, the rafters of houses, hiding in trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush, only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape. there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. you have to see it to believe it, as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo. it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting, especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen, but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind. zombi 3 fits that bill, and then some. it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers, and watch it with some like minded friends. i give it an 8/10, just because of sheer enjoyment.

yeah sure it's cheesy, it's not zombie, but it's not that bad either. it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus, and it's entertaining. i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience, as he was never completely satisfied with it. it is well worth a search out, especially for genre and fulci fans. it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand.

off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly. secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno (rats, night of terror) mattei. this is no dawn of the dead folks.that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen. the script is wonderfully horrible. just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("let's try putting these two molecules together"). the zombies come in all varieties. from moaning shufflers, to machete wielding maniacs, to birds! the gore is plentiful. legs are bitten off, arms amputated, stomachs burst open. the pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. then there's the head in the fridge. oh the head in the fridge! one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2.you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film. get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night.did i mention the head in the fridge?!?!?

although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor (zombi 2) i actually like this one better. this is because of it's faster pace, better settings, and cool 80's soundtrack. it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci. the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good. it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness; for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror? there's even a flying zombie head! how rad is that? definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. also check out zombi 4.

zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making. firstly, it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2, with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a. romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi. confusing enough? basically, none of the films have anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money. i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out. bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time.zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare. scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok. the scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet. overall, i actually liked this film. i heard horrible things, but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable. the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution, corrupted military, man playing god, etc. i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when mattei came on board.besides ripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies. you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with, "when you see the men in white suits & gas masks, run to them for help." this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies. later, they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake.the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner. how is it cool? let me count the ways1. zombie birth 2. flying zombie head 3. zombie birds. 4. zombie with no legs swimming in a pool. my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station. he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl.favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, the scientists asks, "don't you think that once the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground, and contaminate everything?" to which the sargeant boldly replies, "now you're talking science fiction." he also continues to mention the "science fiction" told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.extras: gallery, trailers, and interviews, most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes, yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details.bottom line: a must see for zombie and fulci fans.rating: 7/10molly celaschi www.horroryearbook.com myspace.com/horroryearbook

this movie is such cheesy goodness.a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school. they start getting killed off, they know they are being stalked, so what do they do? one girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat on her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) and go at it.and it comes through with the gore and the t&a.and it's also interesting from a historical/sociological point of view. where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves, or how adults view young people, or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective. this is a brit film made to be an american slasher. it's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak "american" unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents.if you like cheesy 80's slashers (like pieces) then you will like this one.

poor geeky marty (simon scuddamore) gets horribly burned due to a cruel april fool's day stunt gone very wrong. flash forward a decade and those involved (including caroline monroe, known to horror fans for her turns in maniac, faceless & the last horror film) in the prank are psyched for the upcoming 10 year high school reunion not aware that a court jester-masked killer is hiding out in the (now closed down) school and out for revenge.chaulk this one up to being a guilty pleasure, i knew it's a bad film. it has all the characteristics of one. yet there's just something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch it from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). i'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrid ending (which, i do have to say, i hate) i guess i like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool kills.eye candy (for the men): josephine scandi & donna yeager both get topless eye candy (for the ladies): a gratuitous cock shot of simon scuddamore at the start of the film my grade: b- lionsgate dvd extras: optional trivia track; trailer for this film; and trailers for my bloody valentine (1981), monster squad, dirty dancing

"slaughter high" is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty,who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters.the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned.five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion-just the ten of them of course,and low and behold marty murders them one after another.british actress caroline munro("maniac")leads the cast as the heroine(who dies anyway!).the acting is completely awful,there's also no suspense at all.plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore-freaks:a guy's stomach explodes,another female victim literally gets an acid bath,a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted,a guy is crushed by a tractor,one girl is drowned,and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye.the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester's mask and the setting(a beautiful old english castle)is really nice.however the dream finale is utterly pathetic.all in all it's true that "slaughter high" is a piece of garbage,but i enjoyed it.only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks.

a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty (a sympathetic performance by simon scuddamore) which leaves him hideously disfigured. five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion. of course, an angry and vindictive marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors. writers/directors mark ezra, peter litten and george dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clichés which make these 80's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun: fake jump scares, prowling steadican shots, a fierce storm, an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack, a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity, a totally ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, tacky make-up f/x, and one of those lovably lame "it was all just a terrible dream" fake-out non-endings. moreover, the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods: gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, a guy being crushed under a huge tractor, and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex. thirtyish british cult horror siren caroline munro is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick. the cast all give solid performances, with especially stand-out work from carmine iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader skip pollack, billy hartman as faded macho meathead frank, and donna yeager as foul-mouthed slut stella. co-producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as munro's sleazy agent manny. harry manfredini's moody, rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his "friday the 13th" scores. alan pudney's slick cinematography does the trick. good, trashy fun.

i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. i was actually surprised at how good it was.the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty. they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned.a few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.at the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. but, marty is in the hospital with severe burns. although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.the acting is terrible but that is fine.i love the story. i really sympathize with marty. it's like tamara (2005). the bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.i give this movie 8 stars out of 10. good cheesy slasher!

okay, sorry, but i loved this movie. i just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies, because you don't see many like this one anymore! i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what is it imitating? i've never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway.basically its about the popular group in school, who like to make everyones lives living hell, so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty. it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks.so, its like 10 years later, and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters. but...they are the only ones receiving them! so they return back to the old school, and one by one get knocked off by.......yeah you probably know what happens!the only part that disappointed me was the very end. it could have been left off, or thought out better.i think you should give it a try, and try not to be to critical!~*~cupidgrl~*~

my 10/10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked "slaughter high" even before watching it. yes, it's the typical revenge-several-years-after-a-dirty-prank story, but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here?! i couldn't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years.ok, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new. well, it doesn't pretend to. it's the sort of flick that the characters in "scream" probably watched, and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie. after all, who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things? obviously, it's got sort of a reactionary undertone, as people get punished for doing what the '60s championed. but still, you gotta love this stuff! so, with apologies to don mclean, this jester didn't sing for the king and queen!

i have seen slaughter high several times over the years, and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor, but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk, and i never knew that the actor that plays marty rantzen (simon scuddamore) committed suicide after the film was released. i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for americans, and a few of them aren't very good at hiding their english accents.all that aside though, this is the tale of the class nerd, marty, who is the butt of jokes from his classmates, and on one particular day, april fools day, he's lured into the girl's locker room by one caroline munro (yes, playing a teenager) and humiliated big time on film. of course, the coach catches the gang at work & they're all given a vigorous workout to punish them, but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint, which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab, but it's full of something that makes him sick & when he runs to the restroom, one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something marty is mixing, which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid, which leaves poor marty burned & horribly scarred.ten years later, this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old doddsville high, which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible, but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict...except there's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course, they eat, drink, and be merry. for soon, they will die, of course.the gang is stalked one-by-one by a figure in a jester's mask, but could it be marty? they don't know, they figure he's either in a loony bin or working for ibm, they're not sure which. but whoever it is, he's making quick work of them. particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer. she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version, because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time. i could be wrong but i believe that wasn't on the tape.at any rate, there's somewhat of a twist ending, and that also contains footage not on the tape, i believe. there's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised, but apart from that i didn't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version, probably so but it's been a while since i've last seen it.at any rate, if you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd, because it's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it. 7 out of 10.

it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school. if you liked this movie, then i would suggest you watch valentine. i just found out today that the guy who played marty(simon) killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job. i wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie. it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it. when he was changing in the showers, carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready, camera, electric shock, pole. when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked. he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it, grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling. they picked him up, dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed, and they electricuted him(slightly). when the kids are in detention, given by the coach, 2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up. skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him. while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was. the lab blows up disfiguring him badly. 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded. one by one the people get killed off. i don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have gotten back up after marty left. she almost got out the first time.

this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of them all, so when i saw it was free on demand, i had to watch it! it stars caroline munro, from both dr. phibes films (she was his wife that died!), dracula a.d. 1972, the golden voyage of sinbad, captain kronos - vampire hunter, the spy who loved me, maniac, and faceless.brought to you by the people behind don't open til christmas and pieces, heres my thoughts on this...it opens on april fools day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while hes naked!). the coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. but, the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive.cut to the future, and its th high school reunion, or so they think (bwahahha?). the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid, and its april fools day (or really, the day before april fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall. then they finally break into the school and it starts storming.inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and belongings, along with marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook. they also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends his time saying "oooh yesser! yesser! i don't want no trouble, sir!" and then is killed instantly. pretty pointless character, but hes still my favorite.the movie takes a page out of alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die, and they start freaking out, except for shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. of course, it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off (very cool, mind you) the rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask.. whats their plan? "all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon. marty wont kill us during mid-day!". seriously, thats what he said. apparently you can only kill at nighttime. but will they survive through the night? who will live and who will die? and why are all the bodies disappearing? rent, buy, or steal this great movie to find out! the movie is actually very good, filled with clichés (car wont start, dammit!) and just plain slasher fun. not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan. i recommend it to all of you! and, not to mention, it has a spin off! 1989's cutting class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell.favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't. "talk dirty to me, frank!!" she screams "uh... tits!" "dirtier!" "uh... tits. f*ck. tits. boobs. f*ck.". it seems to work for her and at her climax, the killer electrocutes them both!

slaughter high starts like any other day at doddsville county high school where little minx carol manning (caroline munro) has tricked resident nerd marty rantzen (simon scuddamore) into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower, while doing so carol's gang of friends come in & give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april fool's day joke. the school's sports coach (marc smith) saves marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame marty, they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face. years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school, they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there. they all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as marty is back & has revenge on his mind...originally shot under the title april fool's day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april fool's day (1986) made the same year this american english co-production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors, george dugdale, mark ezra & peter litten (after never seeing a film with three credited director's i've now seen two in a week the other being the jean-claude van damme flick kickboxer (1989)) & i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation. one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick, it doesn't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules, short comings & trappings & plays up to them. basically it delivers what it promises, a homicidal killer, blood, boobs & babes. i thought the character's were alright, the story was ok even though it's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of flak for. the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another. some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who's complaining?despite three credited director's slaughter high turned out pretty good, i liked the look of the film a lot. the isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good, the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the rundown school. while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made. there is some good gore here including burnt bodies, people melted with acid, impalings, stomach explosions, axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain! the special effects are also better than one would expect & i was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count.technically the film is better than i had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today, i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though. supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england. harry manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from friday the 13th (1980) & it's sequels. anyone living here in the uk will probably recognise billy hartman who played frank as a regular in emmerdale farm (one of our nations top rated soap operas) in which he plays terry woods! while most horror fans will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role. legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer... talk about typecasting! you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces (1982) which he also produced behind him in his office.slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot, did you see that? i didn't say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level & i'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so i can't recommend it but i can say i liked it, make of that what you want. make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out. if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high won't change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this.

wow, praise imdb and google, for i have been trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now. slaughter high, man! hells yeah!i'm not going to bore you with a plot summary, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, 'cause you all know what's up. that's why you're here anyway. what i will do, however, is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential 80's d-movie slasher joint.in 1987, when i was around the age of 7, my father used to rent all these horror movies. would he care that his kids were watching them with him? no. so, at that young age i saw slaughter high. what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time. i haven't seen it since, but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie. for example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) gets electrocuted. or, the guy being drowned in a cess pool. come on! my personal favorite, though...the exploding stomach from the tainted beer. amazing! how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like, 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? then his stomach explodes? what!? and that great line: let's take my car...it always starts. classic crap all the way. i mean, i look back now, almost 20 years later, and laugh at it. but when i was 7, i was scared sh!tless. that jester hat (or was it a mask?) that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f*ck out!all in all, yes, a crappy movie. but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me. either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show, or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr.

slaughter high is about a boy named marty. he was harassed, and picked on in high school. a group of kids played several pranks on him, and these pranks were really bad. the last prank ended tragically.cue to 5 years later. the gang of kids meet up again for a reunion. one of them set it up at the old high school. the school is now abandoned, and they have to break in. for some reason, the janitor is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer.they start partying ,and looking at their old lockers, and they see something of marty's. one girl feels sorry for marty but another guy calms her down.once the kills begin, it is great. every kills is creative and gory. we see a figure in a jester mask, hunting them one by one throughout the school. it appears marty is back to exact revenge. after the first person is killed, they find out they are locked in the school. they begin looking for a way out.now, there are a number of illogical things in this movie. first of all, i don't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion. second of all, after the first kid dies, a girl gets blood all over her. they all run away in a panic, yet she runs to the bathroom, and finds a bathtub. hrr friend has just been killed, and she decides to take a bath!? more importantly, why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom. anyways, the bathtub doesn't seem to really work....and she dies a horrible death this is an 80s movie. it is a horror slasher. who cares if it has some illogical parts. i for one don't. this movie has really great deaths. the ending.... there is a twist. having recently seen haute tension, i can compare the two. the only way they are similar is that there is a twist, which kind of left me disappointed.....then right after the twist, comes a great, if not the best kill, in the movie.after the last kill, the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy, and it was the perfect way to end the movie. it has me going "wow..."

i have lost count of how many reviews i've written on slaughter high. i've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie. simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide, and even though this was his only film, he is what made the movie so great. at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide. then i found out due to the current webpage at www.imdb.com he was born in 1957, in dayton, ohio. simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses. he did a good acting job, who can disagree? i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie. must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least. i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade. i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered, and that high schools do not have bath tubs! i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent, and unfortunately for simon's death he made no future films. the reason(s) for his suicide are a mystery, and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high. he looked like a teenager. i give this film two thumbs up, the best horror film made. probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business. -jacob young

yes, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. yes, the acting does range from average to laughable. yes, it has been done so many times before. however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie. in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing. i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be; a scary, funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none.

"slaughter high" is, perhaps, the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s. it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout. that being said, it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown.the reason why "slaughter high" stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top. marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates. they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower, jabbed at his crotch with a javelin, and, to top it off, rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him.so, the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get. when they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by marty himself -- you realize they haven't matured all that much. they're a bunch of sociopaths.it is mind-boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion, which, by the way, is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair. and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers -- as well as marty's -- on display? there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film. the ending makes little or no sense. and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works: the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon.in all, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all of its flaws. it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd, when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions.

god bless 80's slasher films. this is a fun, fun movie. this is what slasher films are all about. now i'm not saying horror movies, just slasher films. it goes like this: a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders, and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. disfigured and back for revenge, sporting a joker/jester mask (pretty creepy looking, might i add), marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later, after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion. that is basically the plot? what's wrong with that? that's the beauty of 80's slasher films, most of them i would say. a lot of things could be so ridiculous, but they keep drawing you more in an' in as they go by. especially this film.it features some outrageous killings, and some are quite creative as well. (poisoning of a beer can, acid bath, i can't remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either)it really is a fun, fun movie. that's all it is. nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots, never mind their stupidity, and never mind the outrageous, random things that occur in this film. such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer (when he's not even switching any buttons, you'll see) and toilets being able to cough up blood, baths being able to have acid come out of them, just use that as part of your entertainment! because thats what really makes it entertaining.movies like this represent 80's slashers. never again could movies like this get made, know why? it isn't the 80's anymore. that is why you should just cherish them for what they are, good fun! i highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of slahsers such as friday the 13th.one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well, marty rantzen. a disfigured, nerd, who kills all his old foes in a creepy jester mask. a good villain makes a good slasher. simon scuddamore, who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released. that alone adds something creepy to the film, and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character, i guess. all in all, great 80's slashers fun! it's a shame it will never be the same again...
