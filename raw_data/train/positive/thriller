this isn't the comedic robin williams, nor is it the quirky/insane robin williams of recent thriller fame. this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with robin's new love of the thriller. but this isn't a thriller, per se. this is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.also starring sandra oh and rory culkin, this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report, until william's character gets close to achieving his goal.i must say that i was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, or amuse. it felt more like i was watching a guy (williams), as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. in other words, it felt real, and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.all in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not friday/saturday night fare.it rates a 7.7/10 from...the fiend :.

yes its an art... to successfully make a slow paced thriller.the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening.fine performance by robin williams. the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film. however, the core plot is very engaging. the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering. the direction is good. use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!

in this "critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, gabriel (robin williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (toni collette). when troubling questions arise about this boy's (story), however, gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret" according to film's official synopsis.you really should stop reading these comments, and watch the film now...the "how did he lose his leg?" ending, with ms. collette planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to "deleted scenes" land. it's overkill. the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time mr. williams returns to new york. possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the "highway" or "video tape" scenes. the film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a "director's cut"? williams and bobby cannavale (as jess) don't seem, initially, believable as a couple. a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. otherwise, the cast is exemplary. williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a "gay impersonation". sandra oh (as anna), joe morton (as ashe), and rory culkin (pete logand) are all perfect.best of all, collette's "donna" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. ms. oh is correct in saying collette might be, "you know, like that guy from 'psycho'." there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed collette with some award consideration. she is that good. and, director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.finally, writers stettner, armistead maupin, and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.******* the night listener (1/21/06) patrick stettner ~ robin williams, toni collette, sandra oh, rory culkin

the night listener (2006) **1/2 robin williams, toni collette, bobby cannavale, rory culkin, joe morton, sandra oh, john cullum, lisa emery, becky ann baker. (dir: patrick stettner) hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand-out low-key performance.what is it about celebrities and fans? what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? in the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, williams stars as a talk-radio personality named gabriel no one, who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand (culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one's editor ashe (morton) who gives it to no one to read for himself. no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna (collette giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids. naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess (cannavale) whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate.written by armistead maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's novice director stettner) and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. it helps that williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.

you know, robin williams, god bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of "death to smoochy", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially "insomnia" and "one hour photo". "the night listener", despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release, is among his best work, period.this is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. in high school, i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result. i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist. when i saw this movie, the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic "caretaker". her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like "little miss sunshine". there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me. it takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award (as of 2008). it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.this is a good, dark film that i highly recommend. be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.

when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves. that being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood...writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded! with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(jess) and the world around him(donna).as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.it's to bad that most people will avoid this film. i only say that because the average american will probably think "robin williams in a serious role? that didn't work before!" please give this movie a chance! robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.oh and before i forget, i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in. he has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence. it's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!s~

there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times. constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis, have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades. occasionally, some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence. that is the premise of the film entitled " the night listner." it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon (robin williams) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles. perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself. feeling abandoned by both his lover jess (bobby cannavale) and his and best friend (joe morton), he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. it is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter (rory culkin). in reading the boy's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, noon is captivated and wants to help. however, things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare. this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d. logand, sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop, this might be comical. instead, this may prove to be one of william's more serious performances. ***

i enjoyed the night listener very much. it's one of the better movies of the summer.robin williams gives one of his best performances. in fact, the entire cast was very good. all played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch. toni collette is great as the mom, and never goes over the top. everyone is very believable.it's a short movie, just under an hour and a half. i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version. i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads. it is not a hitchcockian thriller. see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well. if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed.my only complaint with the movie was the ending. the director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but this is a minor quibble.

the night listener is probably not one of william's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie. i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before. some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie, but i think it's the great plus of the movie. it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006. it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content, dramatic feeling. this is no americanized movie. neither is it a predictable movie. you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be. this is no excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.

like one of the previous commenters said, this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery. such a waste because collette's performance was eerie and williams was believable. i just kept waiting for it to get better. i don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it could have just been the film. it came across as a canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of x-files. not cheap, just hokey. also, it needed a little more suspense. something that makes you jump off your seat. the movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax. i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the "reality" of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. this movie needs to have a director's cut that tries to fix these problems.

the night listener held my attention, with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (rory culkin) who is very ill. williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone. however, williams' ex-boyfriend (nice job from bobby cannavale) raises doubt about the boy, which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect. i will leave it at that. toni collette also stars.i enjoyed this film, with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin's adoptive mother. sandra oh also starred as williams' friend. the night listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout. at times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but i liked it anyway. i enjoy williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me. recommended. 8/10

popular radio storyteller gabriel no one(robin williams,scraggy and speaking in hushed,hypnotic tones) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from wisconsin named pete logand(rory culkin),who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents. to boot,pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still,since his partner jess(bobby cannavale,good)happens to be a survivor of hiv himself. he also acquaints himself with pete's guardian,a woman named donna(toni collette,brilliant!)and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin,he discovers some secrets he was(naturally)not prepared to find.based on real events that happened to armistead maupin(who co-wrote the screenplay with terry anderson)and directed by patrick stetner,this film moves a lot faster(90 min.,maybe a few minutes longer)than one might think a movie of this genre would run. that's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. it's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story. i'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that,if you are not familiar with mr.maupin's works or his personal story,you feel a little bit out of the loop here. still,the performances by williams( i would've loved to heard more of his narration,personally),collette,cannavale,culkin and much of the supporting cast(the waitress at the restaurant collete's donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has!)are top-notch and the mood established here--namely,the chilly,lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york--give a terrific framing for this story. it may have ends that don't tie together particularly well,but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with.

if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing. the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about. however, there is not much tension, and williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy.collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. the production felt rushed and holes are apparent. it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. the book is probably better.one thing is certain: taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.

i absolutely loved this film! i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it. i was completely enthralled through every second! i found the story gripping, the acting intense, and the direction spot-on. i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie. even though there was nothing "scary" about the story itself, i was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening. i found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it. there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.

this night listener is better than people are generally saying. it has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. the whole thing feels like one of those fireside "this happened to a friend of a friend of mine" ghost stories. one big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno? so there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations, no "showdown" scenes. thank heaven. you have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. williams isn't terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic ("no one") as he is the everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. toni collette's performance should be nominated for an oscar (even if she maybe shouldn't win it). give it a shot. for quality and content alone, the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.

when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky, and i'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. while every movie has its flaws, the night listener had an exceptionally low count.if you read the last review (it was hard, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie), you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review, you discovered the poster's reason for disdain: he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack...apparently).so, despite the fact that i have never written a review before, i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. let's go over a quick checklist first: 1. great plot? absolutely. i won't give a shred of it away, but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials. this is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. the story really will amaze you, even more so because it's true (and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events).2. wonderful acting? oh yes. robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast, and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago. he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well, i'll let you see for yourself.3. excellent direction? certainly. now, unlike the other poster to which i referred, i actually know something about direction. i've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. of course i really don't think that makes a lick of difference (the only thing that matters is if you like the direction), but i thought i should simply establish once again that i'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, lol).patrick stettner's direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of "tension and release" rather than the messy, fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today. some people can truly show you a story through their camera, while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.4. lighting, cinematography, and editing? great all around. i've already wrote so much, and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so i'll just wrap it up.in short, go see this movie. don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post. enjoy the show! -ben

though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original 'the vanishing' (spoorloos) it does have the same overall feel, except for that koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyric. the beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is in the end. a surprise emotional ending. as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film, but it is done all very beautifully. never explicit, but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour. it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one. where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject, 'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste. 'de grot' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years. when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved. what can we ask more of a film? anyway, this film even gives more....

tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei', a novel that was put on the screen twice ('spoorloos' and 'the vanishing'). one of the dutch writer's more recent works is 'de grot', a psychological thriller about two totally different men, egon and axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life. egon is a quiet, somewhat dull person, who spends his time studying and writing geography books. axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic 'party-animal', a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom. from the moment they meet, axel has a strong influence on egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything (such as reading thick books like egon); ultimately, egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country.after having read the book last year, i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it. in my opinion, the book suffers especially from the complex structure. while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle: the many episodes are not presented chronologically, so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode. because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote: you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her. another complaint was the fact that the main characters, egon and axel, are a little stereotypical. egon is 'the' dull intellectual, while axel is his exact opposite. in real life, such one-dimensional people rarely exist; in books and films, they always seem to be there, taking away a lot of credibility.despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book. the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography, humour and acting: fedja van huet (egon) is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting (which is, in my opinion, the highest an actor can achieve). the drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the book's: mainly because the characters are one-dimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying. guess who wrote the script? indeed, krabbe himself. it is obvious that this talented director (that's what the movie makes clear anyway) is hampered by a deficient screenplay. perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.7/10

'de grot' is a terrific dutch thriller, based on the book written by tim krabbé. another of his books, 'het gouden ei' was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called 'spoorloos' ('the vanishing') in 1988. this one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the american remake also called 'the vanishing') but there are times it comes close.especially the opening moments are terrific. we see a man, later we learn his name is egon wagter (fedja van huêt), coming from a plane in thailand. when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border. these scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this.from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. we see how egon, still as a child (here played by erik van der horst), befriends a guy named axel (as a kid played by benja bruijning). we learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how axel (as an adult played by marcel hensema) became a criminal. egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him.the movie is chronological in a way. it shows egon and axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. but from time to time, like i said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.minor spoilers herein.the title means 'the cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. like the beginning, the ending is terrific. the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the end. it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.

though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original 'the vanishing' (spoorloos) it does have the same overall feel, except for that koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyric. the beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is in the end. a surprise emotional ending. as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film, but it is done all very beautifully. never explicit, but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour. it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one. where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject, 'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste.

de grot is a very good film. the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen. some really top-class acting, not only by van huêt, but especially by marcel hensema, who mostly did tv-work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf. the film seems to kick of as a thriller, and sets an excellent mood. then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie. in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending, that will grab audiences by their throats. make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie. a must-see, especially if you liked 'spoorloos' (the vanishing's original screen adaptation).

just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion. every line, every phrase, every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con-man, so well cast. 10 out of 10!

"house of games" is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends. i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert's review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987. i had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. boy, was i in for a surprise. this was one of the smartest, most well-written movies i had ever seen.the screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development. on my second viewing, i began to realize that mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. the climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. it stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film. i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike, and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset. their work, plus mamet's extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's. it is truly a must-see.

just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before. it just keeps getting better and better. you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech, the slow deliberate action, everything being exactly in place.truly one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite!!!

unique movie about confused woman (lindsay crouse) who gets involved with sharp con men. joe mantegna gives an oscar-caliber performance as the slickest of the group. absolutely enchanting first hour, as mantegna shows crouse "the ropes" of his con games. story line unravels a bit later on, but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world. definitely worth a shot.

house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part. a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game.have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong? watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way. sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators. you're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie.this is both a quality and a drawback of the script. as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency. but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development.this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling.

plenty has been written about mamet's "the house of games"; most of it good. i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after 17 years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again. the film's success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film; a good story and a good scam. mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us, the audience, and the mark simultaneously. then he explains the art of conning only to do it again, etc. all the while building the story. "the house of games", now a freebie on cable, is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans. (b+)

this typical mamet film delivers a quiet, evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man (joe mantegna) good. explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist (lindsay crouse), it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences. the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet's films (steven goldstein, jack wallace, ricky jay, andy potok, allen soule, william h. macy), and they do their usual good job. i loved lindsay crouse in this film, and have often wondered why she didn't become a more noted player than she has become. perhaps i'm not looking in the right places!the movie proceeds at a slow pace, with flat dialog, yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending. you'd expect a real let down at the ending, but i found it uplifting and satisfying. i love this movie!

in the spirit of the classic "the sting", this movie hits where it truly hurts... in the heart! a prim, proper female psychiatrist, hungry for adventure, meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals. the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman, and begs to be involved in his operation. while the movie moves kind of "slow", it's climax and ending are stunning! you'll especially enjoy how the doctor "forgives herself"!

a film destined to be on late-night tv long after the present instant "money-makers" have long been forgotten. perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters, but in time they'll grow into an appreciation of this movie.

this movie should not be compared to "the sting", or other caper/heist/con game films. what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. it's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? highly, hugely recommended!

ask yourself where she got the gun? remember what she was taught about the mark's mindset when the con is over? the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning.when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her 80 thousand.the patient was in on the con from the beginning.mantegna does not die in the end - the gun had blanks.there - enough spoilers for you there? this is why people are giving it such high ratings. it's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience.

i'm a big fan of films where people get conned, and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned' genre. in short, it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing what's happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen. the film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it's still difficult to guess where it's going, and every twist comes off as a surprise. as mentioned, i'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler. she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and david mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city. the film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece. lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role. she may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. the way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. at times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film. another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks, say. all in all, house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride.

spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters. but who is conning who here? when does the hunter turn into the prey? this gritty, dark movie is slow moving and seductive. it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path, only to waylay you just as you think you are safe.it has a riveting script, with good acting (at least from the leads). i didn't notice the background music, but it was never jarring, so it must have been done right.i was very surprised that i liked this movie, because i don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end.

get ready for it: this is one of my favourite films of all time. i am relatively unaware of david mamet's (writer and director) other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times(it's always a joy to watch), i can say without hesitation that he is a genius. this film is extremely well written, and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit, con-artistry and back room hustles. the feel of the film is very similar to the sting (1973) and it also pays homage to film noir.it's quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters. it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch.generally, the acting is superb- especially joe mantegna- but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine (lindsay crouse) who is not only a gambler, a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80's hairdo. i agree, but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role.the less you know about the plot of this film, the better, just like mamet's most recent film, the spanish prisoner, because the ending will be even more impressive. just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.

opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama. all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained applies to this film. there isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad. mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor. if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended? as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.

this is very nearly a perfect film. the ideas would be repeated by mamet, but never told so succinctly. this is really about the failure of trust, of the human condition. the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society, every single day? the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller. except, there are no more innocent characters. the world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone is participating in the con. could anything be more true?don't miss the soundtrack. it is wonderful.

"house of games" is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head. "house of games" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate. so it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on, even though we think that we do. but that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities.it has a definite hitchcock slant to it. the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort "marnie", considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master's more thought-provoking works. one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse's character being the same as tippi hedrin's...ten year later perhaps. both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. as crouse's repressed, up-tight character says, "what's life without adventure?" put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!

wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it's hopeless to help her patients. a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better. here she gets involved with joe mantegna. to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and 'house of games' may very well be the best con movie i've seen. david mamet wrote and directed this gem that's full of snappy dialogue, great one-liners, and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end. crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man. and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie, the film is in utter control of it's audience; and we are loving the con.*** out of ****

house of games is spell binding. it's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens. there are few movies i've seen that can grip you so quickly. from the opening scene this movie just gets you.i'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don't read anymore if you don't want to know.i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen-bar none. from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. joe mantegna was also wonderful. the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. i also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.there were a few movies i've seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really, house of games is completely different in it's way. margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. you know something's going to happen but you have no idea what. and just when you think you've guessed what the "something" is, you realize you haven't even scratched the surface....house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well. as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion.in closing, i'd rank this 10 of 10, call it (although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list), most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best "twists" i've ever seen as well. although i love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to movies of the human psyche, it really doesn't get much better then this. see this movie.

here's my first david mamet directed film. fitting, since it was his first, as well. the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con. it's like "the grifters," but without that film's level of acting. (in that film, john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) the acting here is very flat (i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). at least in the beginning. it never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. early in the film, some of lindsay crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration, which they aren't. with the arrival of mantegna things pick up.the dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be. i was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don't. it all sounds very read, rather than spoken. maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. he's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. what's more strange is that other than this, the film doesn't look or feel like a play. the camera is very cinematic. my only problem with "glengarry glen ross" was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. everything flowed.i wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. it's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. that doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. the best chunk is in the middle.it's standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) margaret ford (lindsay crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. how she gets involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, billy is a compulsive gambler. she wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into the house of games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. i'll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (were they just expecting crouse to come in? were they expecting she'd write a cheque? was billy in on it? one of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)and from here the cons are start to roll out. i found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. we're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is. we see the ending coming, and then we didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending i didn't see coming but maybe you did. the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling.i'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. if the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. if you want a fun con movie, then here she is. if you want mamet, go watch "glengarry glen ross" again -- james foley did him better.***

if your idea of a thriller is car chases, explosions, and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire, then "house of games" is definitely not the movie for you. if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it."house of games" tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, dr. margaret ford (lindsay crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike (joe mantegna). to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense. frankly, i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming. just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance.the story is taut and well-crafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good (mantegna is superbly charismatic). some have complained that dr. ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive. but dr. ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot (at one point, i believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... i'll say no more)."house of games" is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity. it will hold your attention every second while you are watching, and stay with you for a long time afterwards.

house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels. it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna, and a strong, strong cast of supporting players, and it introduces ricky jay, card sharp extraordinaire, prestidigitator and historian of magic. its dialogue, written by david mamet, is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unrealness.on the face of it, house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men, diametrically different from the sting, which was played merely for glamour and yuks. at this level it does succeed admirably.however, you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization. the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin. that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus, hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs. house of games sticks to its business. as poe once said of a good short story, it drives relentlessly to its conclusion.there is another strain of movies-about-women, epitomized by thelma and louise, a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed, whether or not they realize their inner strengths. what tripe.as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater. it should be a natural for film festivals. nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. better she should see it on a tv than not at all.

`the united states of kiss my ass'house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. it stars lindsay crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, margaret ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, house of games.the gambler mike (played excellently by joe mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. he offers crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs david mamet.in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. house of games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. with lindsay crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of america earning a living by `honest' crime.the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema. and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10

david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `house of games,' a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. margaret ford (lindsay crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel, 'driven.' still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability. when a patient, billy hahn (steven goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf. this takes her to the `house of games,' a seedy little dive where she meets mike (joe mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. instead of the `twenty-five large' that billy claimed he owed, mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she'll agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. in the middle of a big hand, mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the `tell' of one of the other players. by this time, not only margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. the dialogue, and mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing. as mike leads margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. from that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a `tell' is and how it works, to the lessons of the `short con,' to the stunning climax of this film, mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. and nothing is what it seems. in the end, margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. she changes; and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation. mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does. crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, self-assured exterior, and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum (joey), lilia skala (dr. littauer), j.t. walsh (the businessman), ricky jay (george) and william h. macy (sergeant moran). `house of games' is the quintessential mamet; he's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. but this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. you'll find it under `perfection.' this is one great movie you do not want to miss. i rate this one 10/10.

when i read other comment,i decided to watch this movie...first, cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli; good enough...film,very intelligence and interesting because ,cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia...second,story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion...third,final chapter is not special or interesting,it's regular like other action movies...finally,i recommend to watch this movie...and i hope you'll love it enjoy :d

this movie had an interesting cast, it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job. im glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot. i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation. this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future.

for all of you that don't speak swedish: the swedish [original] title of this film; "rånarna" translates into something in the line of "the robbers". this fact is the main problem i have with the film, cause it's not really about the robbers at all. it's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies. a regular desk job one would think, but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers... exactly: we've seen this before. the fact that there's a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn't really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the film.what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it's masterfully executed in all ways, that the actors are as great as they are and don't overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story.one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it's music sets the right mood when it's needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car-chases spread throughout the film. a nice touch! the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he's not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background, but that's something you have to neglect.all in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you. 7/10

gotta start with ed furlong on this one. you gotta. god bless this kid. $5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life. he has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script. you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like furlong is even acting. maybe that's why his performance was good. same with madsen. you keep thinking, "i bet this guy is really like this in real life." does madsen even have to act? just natural. vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted mummy guy. i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance. her reactions are spot-on in this film. i battled if she was hot or not, but realized i would just like to see more of her. not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films. but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing. it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank, they kill hostages, and the good guys win in the end type of film. the twists keep on coming...and coming.the café scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it's really like in there. not glossed over a bit. think like bourne ultimatum "lite" style on some scenes in the café.and for those bo bice fanatics out there - actor curtis wayne (who plays karl) will make you do a double take. these guys are twins.as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town. made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents. but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of. and some of them are smoking hot. moncia dean? need i say more.

a very early oliver stone (associate-)produced film, and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman (co-founder and president of the world's only real independent film studio troma, creator of the toxic avenger and, at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival, lifetime-achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years). having raised the money for this film on his own, lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself. but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore. indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd's version of his own script - as one of the world's most original, daring, experimental and non-compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has. but as it is we have the gershuni-directed film. and weather it is due to the strong script, or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own, sugar cookies is a very intelligent, highly suspenseful and well-crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives. the shoestring budget the small studio (this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now, michael herz, formed troma) had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive, indeed does not have a "low budget" look at all. the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone (played by enigmatic mary woronow) and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won't reveal not to spoil a delightful story. this leads to a succession of plot-twists, mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock's vertigo and at least as inventive. the atmosphere is a lot grimmer, though, and some comparisons to nicholas roeg's and donald cammell's performance come to mind. in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end, which, along with a splendidly interwoven sub-plot with a nod to kaufman's earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what's the fuss, makes for a very exciting one-and-a-half-hour. certainly one of the best films in troma's library, and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste. the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry (later seen in george romero's the crazies), thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult-favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself. highly recommended.

this movie is not schlock, despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions. a dark fable for adults. exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies, and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme. a weird movie with enticing visuals: shadows and contrast are prominent. definitely worth a look, especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence. through all the cruelty and wickedness, a moral, albeit twisted, can be gleamed.

starting off, here's a synopsis: porno queen alta lee (lynn lowry) is murdered by her pornographer lover max (george shannon) in a game of sexual russian roulette. alta's other lover, icy lesbian casting agent camila stone (mary woronov), provides an alibi for max. but camila has an agenda of her own, and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie (lynn again) in a web of sexual mind games. when the lookalikes' identities are sufficiently blurred, the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter.though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention, i find it to be a sexy, suspenseful gem. cult goddess woronov has one of her best-ever roles, and she and sexy-innocent lowry play off each other well. the unsettling music provided by gershon kingsley, plus two original songs ("all-american boy," "you say you've never let me down") and the jaynetts' "sally, go 'round the roses" compose a memorable soundtrack. theodore gershuny's direction is sharp, with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society's upper crust. with tons of great new york atmosphere, ondine (woronov's friend and fellow warholite) giving a great performance in a small role, and exotic monique van vooren as max's ex-wife in a comic sub-plot. this sub-plot, though amusing, looks like it belongs in another movie altogether. however, i'm not complaining, as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic-thriller garbage currently being cranked out.trivia: sugar cookies was originally rated x (soft-core) and released by general film corporation in 1973. i am the proud owner of an original one-sheet poster--lucky me! in 1977, the movie was cut for an r and re-released by troma team, which now offers it uncut on videotape. mary woronov was the wife of theodore gershuny at the time, and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera. she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions, kemek (1970) and silent night, bloody night (1972).

the first von trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa. europa tells a story of a young german-american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war. he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. the society is suffering from corruption. his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. the atmosphere is astounding. the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene. just when you think you've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!!

it's cheesy, it's creepy, it's gross, but that's what makes it so much fun. it's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable. this movie is great to make fun of. rent it for a good laugh.the film centers around three women newscasters, during a time way before cellphones. they go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't get a room to stay the night. and that's when they meet ernest keller. he's creepy in a psycho kind of way. and he offers to let them stay at his home. but he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there.stephen furst's performance is so amazing as "the unseen", that he really carries this film. most of the movie is kind of dull, although finding out the truth of ernest's family is kind of interesting. just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look. barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy. i consider the movie an old gem, hard to find and worth a look.

this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick ("carrie" and others) and barbara bach. it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it. this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. it seems that 3 young newswomen (karen, vicky, and jennifer) travel to the small city of solvang, california to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller (lassick) and his strange wife virginia. vickie stays behind, feeling ill, as the other 2 are off to film their story. she is soon murdered at the house, in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement). soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover. jennifer is fighting with her (ex?)lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to murder her as well. virgina does not totally agree with earnest's plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior. here the film turns almost comic as junior (portrayed hysterically by stephen furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient, manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done. the actors/actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick, furst, and bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining!

three girls (an all-female media-crew, including cult-actress barbara bach, no less) visiting a small town to cover a festival, end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague. well-made little shocker, suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue-scenes and a rather thin plot-line (that doesn't do very well in hiding its secrets). one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock-material), and this is basically what the film thrives on. performances & cinematography are pretty much above par (compared to many other late 70's/early 80's films in the same vein), but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax-scene in the basement-setting. from the moment that "keller junior" character was introduced, his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close until the end of the film. a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick (who was funnily wacko in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest", and now utterly demented in "the unseen") take on one of the leading roles.

the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show. the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable. the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the movie worth watching. the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. i rated it an 8 out of 10.

it's true that danny steinmann's "the unseen" is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot, no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single cliché the genre has brought forward over the decades, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. on the contrary, my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting. the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival, but their hotel forgot to register their booking. in their search for a place to stay, the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion. one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house. "the unseen" can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics "psycho" and "the texas chainsaw massacre". the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films, like twisted family secrets in the cellar, voyeurism, crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens. still, i don't consider these to be negative remarks, as "the unseen" is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade. although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast, director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house "unseen" like the title promised. the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre. sydney lassick, immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller. his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed. also stephen furst, who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen, gives away a tremendous performance as "junior". he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving. "the unseen" is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70's exploitation and generally weird stuff.

gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast, a television reporter who travels with her crew (karen lamm and lois young) to solvang, california, to cover a danish festival. the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full. so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller (a phenomenal sydney lassick). wouldn't you know it, ernest and meek partner virginia (lelia goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their cellar: pitiable, deformed, diaper-clad "junior" (stephen furst, in a remarkable performance) who ultimately terrorizes the girls.a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax, delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour. the hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of "psycho" here - are great settings. most of all, the perverse plot involves incest and patricide, allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality. and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls. the final shot is especially sad."the unseen" is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery.8/10

get this film if at all possible. you will find a really good performance by barbara bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by  "the unseen". i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach, whom i'd just viewed in "the spy who loved me." i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. so: we start with a nice fresh premise. tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town, solvang, that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. she brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (the late karen lamm plays bach's sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching bach (mrs. ringo starr) and lamm (mrs. dennis wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) anyway  bach's disgruntled beau follows her to solvang, as he's not done arguing with her. there's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (maybe to bach's boyfriend, because think of it  where's he gonna stay?). the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor mr. keller (the late sidney lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home, insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. oh no! next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife, warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along. trouble in paradise! the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes, but one of the girls doesn't feel good. bach and lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about mrs. keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. speaking of which  under-the-weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. she hears him, thinks he's come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn't get a long enough look. after he's left, poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening round of action) by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  the unseen! lamm comes home next (bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and can't find anyone in the house. she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting the unseen again! well, at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into mr. keller's past and get the full story of what his sick, sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much. bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. meanwhile, lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can't let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.i cannot say enough for stephen furst, whom i'd never seen before; it's obvious that he did his homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; bach and goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie luster. not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. no stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners... a real treat for your collection.

los angeles tv news reporter jennifer (the beautiful barbara bach of "the spy who loved me" fame) and her two assistants karen (the appealingly spunky karen lamm) and vicki (the pretty lois young, who not only gets killed first, but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene) go to solvang, california to cover an annual danish festival. since all the local hotels are booked solid, the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky, but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky ernest keller (deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late, great sydney lassick) and his meek sister virginia (a solid lelia goldoni). unfortunately, keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement: a portly, pathetic, diapered, incest-spawned man-child mongoloid named junior (an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by stephen furst; flounder in "animal house"), who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc. capably directed by danny steinmann, with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast, a compellingly perverse plot, excellent make-up by craig reardon, a nicely creepy atmosphere, a wonderfully wild climax, a slow, but steady pace, likable well-drawn characters, and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame (the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch), this unjustly overlooked early 80's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out.

dolph lundgren is back! detention marks dolphs first film in nearly 2 years, and that is following the delayed hidden agenda. this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips, agent red and stormcatcher. however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda, which was better in almost every respect. what this film does have in it's favour from dolph's previous outing, is a sense of cheesy fun. the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role, and it's good to see dolph doing his own stunts again.the films story is ludicrous and prime b-movie material. an ex-military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching, whilst taking a detention class, he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal. the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches. if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy. thankfully the filmmakers don't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability, this film has a so bad it's enjoyable kind of vibe.where the film is let down is miss-using a fairly decent budget. the budget of around 10 million has not been well spent. it's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination. the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse. there are some good moments. you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning, with plenty of destruction. the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen. as for the cast. hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages. there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film. this however has problems. the actors are on the most part bad. the bad guys are terrible, but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness. the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters. they all hate authority, each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons, but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability. this movie is all about dolph though. while this film is nowhere near his best, it is nowhere near his worst. it also marks a turning point in his career. he is now back in good shape, and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action. dolph looks enthusiastic here, he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man (running from explosions in slow-mo, one liners, and handling large weapons) again in a movie like his older ones, albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one. it is good to see dolph looking energised. his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary, and using doubles a lot (he still does all the fights himself though) but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it.overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode. there's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm. **

this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren, however alex karzis is awful as the villain!. the story is very good, and i found the kids to be likable for the most part, plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this!. the action scenes are excellent, and it's almost like die hard except it's set in a school!, plus kata dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick!. the finale is very exciting, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, however i just wished it had another villain, because alex karzis just didn't cut it as the villain way too ott, and laughable for my tastes. this should be higher then 4.1 in my opinion, as i thought it was a great action film, and while the kids, were very stupid at times, they got quite resourceful as the movie went along!, plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well!. the ending is very amusing,and corey sevier's character was my favorite student!, plus dolph has still got it!. this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from lundgren!, but alex karzis is awful as the villain, still i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. sidney j. furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. there is a bit of blood and violence. we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,knife in the side of the head, bloody arrow hits, an impaling, and other minor stuff. the acting is fantastic!. dolph lundgren is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass as usual, had great chemistry with the kids, had an awesome character, is very charismatic, and he may not have shown a great emotional rage, he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors! (lundgren rules!!!!!). alex karzis is god awful as the villain, he is laughably ott, was boring, and not menacing at all, he also annoyed the crap out of me. kata dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do, she was the real villain in my opinion!. corey sevier is funny as mick, he was my favorite student, and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half, i liked him a lot!, he had good chemistry with dolph too. dov tiefenbach(willy),chris collins(hogie),mpho koaho(jay tee),danielle hampton(alicia),nicole dicker(charlee) all do great as the students. jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiancée. rest of the cast do fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick, it isn't going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie. our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day. sure the script isn't going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action. dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes, and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well. all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick, but youv'e seen it a million times before.

i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw. it was a cool fun movie.dolph looked superbly cool on the bike.he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies.he is now in a pretty good shape.the story was ok and the other actors were also passable.i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie.but it also had its share of problems. the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target.they should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way. another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing. i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers. there should've been more bad guys. last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget. overall the movie was a good movie.i enjoyed it.i would recommend others to watch it. p.s. now u r a dead beat cop. (some one-liners were also cool)

and i am a nicole kidman fanatic. i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book, which, for all i know, she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie. all four of the principals are excellent, but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing.while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this one asks too much of the viewer. it could have been very funny (which it is in parts) or quite frightening (which it is in one scene) but the director didn't seem to know which way to go.

i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film. for one, i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre, but given this, the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all. this is british comedy at its finest - dark, quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are. i must stop short, however, of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone; i went to see it with several people, some english, some european and some american and while some of us loved it (mainly from the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. if you think you're into this kind of thing then go. if not, don't. 10/10.

i didn't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film, apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet. that and it had nicole kidman in it. i absolutely loved the film though, and came out thinking 'wow'.refreshingly down to earth, the film moves along nicely, with a few suprises at each corner. the relationships in the film are believeable, with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully. the humour is subtle, with some great 'office'-like scenes at the bank, and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood.overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation. it's less about heroics and more about delicate relationships. brit-filmmaking at its best...(9/10)

as usual, hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie. but, this one is a classic - from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman!! well done. even facial expressions were great! language was perfect (even in russian language) and nicole did a splendid job!! hey guys - you get what you pay for:)

excellent movie, albeit slightly predictable. i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie. some of her other works haven't shown the amazing talent this woman has, but birthday girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest. even without words kidmans acting shines through.

i caught this on the dish last night. i liked the movie. i traveled to russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 kids). i can't put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing "bad" turn "good" and "good" turn "semi-bad". i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie. like "i can't belive this is happening to me" whether it's good or bad it the same look (and it works). great ending. 7/10. rent it or catch it on the dish like i did.

good, funny, straightforward story, excellent nicole kidman (i almost always like the movies she's in). this was a good "vehicle" for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both. a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories, great closing lines. chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good, but unpopular romantic comedy ("truth about cats & dogs"). maybe they're too implausible. ebert didn't even post a review for this. the great "screwball" comedies obviously were totally implausible ("bringing up baby", etc.). if you've seen one implausible comedy, you've seen them all? or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s. weird. birthday girl is a movie i've enjoyed several times. nicole kidman may be the "killer app" for home video.

this is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!. all the characters are great, and the story while bizarre, is fascinating and very interesting, plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this!. it's very hard to describe this movie, because it really is quite bizarre, it's a comedy/romance, one minute then it turns into a thriller the next, however it was still very entertaining all the same, plus nicole's russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together, and i loved vincent cassel's performance!, plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise!. the ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!. you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed, and i thought all the characters were really likable, plus the finale is especially good.this is nicole's movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. this is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. jez butterworth does a very good job here, with great camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. the acting is wonderful!. nicole kidman, is stunningly gorgeous!, and is amazing as always, she is incredibly sexy, very likable, had one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, had very good chemistry with ben chaplin, and had a very mysterious character!, she was amazing. (kidman rules!!!!). ben chaplin is great here, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, had very good chemistry with kidman, the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on kidman, even though what she did was wrong, and i loved how he got revenge in the end!. vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was ott, but he was very intense and quite creepy at times, this role was perfect for him. mathieu kassovitz is ok here, but didn't have much to do. rest of the cast are fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5

i've had a lot of experience with women in russia, and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like, unfortunately. they are very cunning, ruthless, and greedy, as well as highly unfair. from the robotic sex, the hustling for gifts, to the lies and betrayal, i've experienced it all in russia.i know what i'm talking about. and here are my qualifications: here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride. it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met, black comedy, scams i was privy to, and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv.http://www.happierabroad.com/photojournals.htmit's like reality tv. you will love it. i spent a ton of time putting it together. so check it out. the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals.my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell, so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia? however, there is one factual impossibility in this film, and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport. it doesn't work that way at all, so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way, and i challenge anyone to find one that does. the fact is, you can only order the russian lady's contact info (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. from there, you correspond and then visit her, and if you want to bring her to your country, you start the immigration process at your ins office, and wait months after that. that's how it works in real life. you can't just order her to arrive at your airport. us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen.wumaster - i got everything i wanted by going abroad! you can too! http://www.happierabroad.com

nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great. i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too. this is not great cinema but i was most entertained. given most films these days this is high praise indeed.

every time i see nicole i like her more. i love a movie like this. a woman you just won't give up on, but she keeps breaking your heart. first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage, the kim novak - laurence harvey version. the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can't speak russian, i'm sure. funny how people miss the point. the no-goodnik russian guys were well cast too. finally, i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin, as somebody else noted, he plays a sap with great dignity, and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole. to think, guys get paid for that, mind-blowing.

modern, original, romantic story.very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin.miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent. ben chaplin is also good as the shy, dull clerk. for the men (and some women) : miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic. i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is. it's not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her. some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense. although i hoped for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me. conclusion : good movie. les pays-bas : huit points.

a small funny film. it is totally incredible, unbelievable, impossible. but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms. of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet. you must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never, ever, ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally. most of their "businesses" there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you. but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly silly. but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning. one think is sure too. security in english airports is not exactly what it should be, but i guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically. then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and don't expect to get fair compensation. or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous. i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener. funny, isn't it? dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could, only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it. i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control, with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment--imho. thus for instance, dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home, or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention, or other pet causes of kidman's. here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job. i don't how or who was able to restrain her, but apparently it worked. the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman. and consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable. of course, the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy, but his transformation is adequately believable. it isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego. instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, apart from their criminal mission. her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture. and while they are his adversaries, they are never really his enemy. in effect, they teach him to be compete.i really marveled at kidman's ability to physically appear russian. it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian, but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it. maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing. i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film. despite my gratuitous digs at ms. kidman, the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime.

lars von triers europa is an extremely good film. how's that? von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least he did have with europa. to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen. even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list. i also think it is perhaps the scariest, the most gothic and complete film around. all right there are other good ones too, but this one is my favorite. the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever.

this is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. nicole kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well. the final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course. worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.

the critics didn't like this film. it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain. which was a great shame, because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain first.nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian. ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from 'the graduate', and 'birthday girl' has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic (despite being a totally different story!).sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it's memorable, moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster.see it with an open mind!

from what critics and audiences indicated, birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker. still, because i love nicole kidman, i decided to rent it last night. it proved to be quite worthy of watching. sure, it isn't your basic american comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie, but that's why i liked it. it was a change from all the other movies around, a breath of fresh air. sure, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked. first off, kidman was fabulous again in a very different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy role. she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood. not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective, but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn't know it was nicole kidman, you would never question her authenticity. harrison ford should have taken note in "k-19." overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz.

this film is definitely an odd love story. though this film may not be much to shout about, nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten, though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans & hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area. what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series"heartbeat" soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick.nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends-up as fairly decent weekend entertainment. a good one to watch, and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character.

are you a giraffe?... ask john to nadia, and she, sure of responding well, responds him: yes. in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other, and at the same time, the questions and doubts in "birthday girl". a film that i heard a lot of times, but i don't dare to see... until two hours of write this."birthday girl" is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count, at the same time, that nicole kidman is one of the best actress (besides she is pretty and intelligent) that i have ever seen. "birthday girl" is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet. the woman that he finds comes from russia. she seems to be that delicate woman, normal, not more. one day, in her birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. the man, begin to discover certain things. since here, he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been.much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot. much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel. but "birthday girl" is just the opposite. this movie is full of good surprises, good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined. this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind. "birthday girl" have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes, but at the same time, certain touching nature, and makes it so deeper."birthday girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but at the end, is totally satisfactory. and i'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.*sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.

the trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be. this movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. kidman, being one of my favorites, of course i'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. three out of four stars. 9/5/02.

this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching. the story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention. the acting is first class and the characters are represented well. sometimes it feels like the director couldn't decide himself between drama and romantic comedy. ben chiller's portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s.m. magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs! as does the look in nicole kidman's eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time... other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant.

for a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was pretty good. it's another one of these modern-day british crime films that are quirky ("snatch," "sexy beast," etc.). it's not wild like "snatch" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters.it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. basically, it's about a low-key british male who sends away for a russian "mail order bride" who winds up, with the aid of two russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.ben chapin and nicole kidman co-star, and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman's russian cohorts. this is a different kind of film and well-acted. kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face.

john (ben chaplin) is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from london. though the internet, he contacts a russian agency of brides. he selects sophia (nicole kidman  the guy could be lonely and shy, but certainly has a good taste, doesn't he?) and when they met each other, he realizes that she does not speak english. the communication between each other is basically limited by sex (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the guy, just have some kinky sex with nicole kidman!). on her birthday, two russian friends of her visit them. then, lots of surprises will happen. i liked this movie: first, it is almost impossible to be 'labeled'. is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? i believe all the choices are correct. nicole kidman is gorgeous as usual, and i am very curious about her russian: is she speaking russian in a correct accent indeed, or just faking? anyway, i found it an enjoyable movie. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "a isca perfeita" ("the perfect bait")

this movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.this guy john (ben chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for nadia (nicole kidman), ordered by email from russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by johns plan. however a glitch turns up - nadia does not speak a word of johns language. although calm and emotionless on the outside, john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message "you would have probably acted likewise".kidman, cassel & kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, "almost" only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.the pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. to sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. like the idea of the "rude awakening" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society's machine, the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings ("welcome to the machine!"). i bet that in the end, john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all.thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! please make a sequel! and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, i am sure of it.

this incredibly formulaic flick from the "walker, texas ranger" squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie. in addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. however, it's a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. that's all it was meant to do and it does so. the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad. the acting is also decent, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal. if you're a fan of the genre (and of "walker, texas ranger"), you will definitely love this. if not, then don't waste your time. 8/10

a true hero of modern times , chuck norris has left tv "walker , rexas ranger ", and is looking new steps for his artistic career. the president´s man is the second movie of a future tv series , with norris in the title role, and with young actors like jennifer tung or judson mills ( one of the young rangers of "walker " ) . the old master teachs to young aspirant . it´s one of the most powerful themes of "the president´s man ". in this tima, "a line in the sand " has reached world surprise for his tratment of terrorism in usa , months before the tragic september 11. eric norris, son of chuck is the director . the movie is amusing, a good action work , plenty of fights and heroism . chuck norris have many plans for the future . bells of innocence , his next picture, will be the following.

good show, very entertaining. good marshal arts acting. good story plot. the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich, to chuck, norris, jennifer tung, and especially a big hand to judson mills. an especially fine tribute to robert urich, in his latter days. a great ! actor who will be truly missed.

there are a few spoilers in this comment!!contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex4u and a few others, i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series.i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little, the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired.the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed. i do fail to see how that many "professionals" weren't able to hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and deke, being the hero, had to survive.as for the comment about needing to "get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs." this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the u.s.if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it, maybe they would have realized the plot of the story: rashid, a bin laden like character, planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states. the president's man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem.perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it.

i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film. although the acting may not be superb, the fight scenes are fantastic. i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him. in my opinion, the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production! i hope you take the time to view this movie!

ooverall, the movie was fairly good, a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes, but chuck norris did hardly anything, except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. the movie was very similar to the events of sept. 11, with a bin laden-like terrorist sending a video to the president (urich) and threatening to detonate it. judson mills had some superb action roles, taking out rashid's compound and various kick-butt roles but, there was a lack of chuck norris. judson took over most of the action, leaving joshua (chuck) with que on her computer. but, overall, it was realistic and didn't lack the action, but only did it on mr. norris' part. i gave the film 7/10.

if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris & judson mills then this is the movie to see.it has a lot of adventure in it.it is a great follow up to president's man.the chemistry between the main three stars(chuck norris,judson mills,jennifer tung)is incredible.my personal opinion.this movie along with the original,has turned out so well,that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series.if you've seen president's man,i recommend this movie for you.if you've seen president's man:a line in the sand but you haven't seen president's man,then let me suggest that you do.you will not be disappointed with either one.

`europa' (or, as it is also known, `zentropa') is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen. the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless... a true feast for the eyes. the picture was a contender for a 1991's golden palm in canners. the award went to barton fink (by coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to zentropa. here's an exercise in class: rent both films and be a judge for yourself.

johny to makes here one of his best style exercises, making a strong film with a good yakuza's story. the election of the new yakuza's boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization.in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context, making a very strong gangs film. i specially love the way he tells the history, moving around all the roles inside the yakuza's family, and making that we see the violence, like the only way they have to solve their problems...talking about, the technical aspects, the film is a good example of paused, rythmic and planified way of shooting a film. one of the hong kong films of the year. is like infernal affairs, but without the easy action-violence scenes, and the confused storyline. strongly recommended to all asian films lovers.(sorry for my english, better do in spanish lol)

enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man, no doubt representing modern society. i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long. i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest. on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone, they are still there.

not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name, this is a stylised look at hong kong's triad gangs. called election because a new leader or 'chairman' is elected by ancient traditions every two years. two candidates are up for the position and through ego, bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least. expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. the asian godfather this is not, but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence. subtitled volume 1 i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals. either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right.

this isn't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective.there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on.the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows.the violence when it comes is brutal, no guns or martial art scenes with special effects, this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation.the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable.

there can be no denying that hak se wui (election in english) is a well made and well thought out film. the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film where john woo's hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled (1992) and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the 'bad' point of view, they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable, a good example being city on fire (1987).election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes, spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful (if that's the right word) manner as well as the clever little 'in pieces' of film-making. it's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure: there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say, goes. the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run. needless to say; certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds, some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular.election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third. trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points. i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested. this happens a few times: a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested; there's a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested; some other triads are having a pre-election talk but the police show up and guess what? you know.once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would, it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving. the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it's been hotwired, another chase involving a motorbike and a kung-fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable, realistic and violent but like i said, they are in a 'tasteful' manner. where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail. when the triads are in jail, the bars are covered with wire suggesting they're all animals in cages as that's how they behave on the outside when in conflict. another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol, elevating themselves above other head gangsters who'd use champagne (the long good friday) and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate.election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise-en-scene as you look at what's going on. some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies. the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film; hinting at chinese tradition in the process. i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly: two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic, unpredictable and violent: in a tasteful manner, of course.

election is a chinese mob movie, or triads in this case. every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader, and at first it seems a toss up between big d (tony leung ka fai, or as i know him, "the other tony leung") and lok (simon yam, who was judge in full contact!). though once lok wins, big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader. unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters, this one is not an action movie. it has its bloody moments, when necessary, as in goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. there are a lot of characters, which is really hard to keep track of, but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit. a 100-year-old baton, which is the symbol of power i mentioned before, changes hands several times before things settle down. and though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70-minute mark, there are still a couple big surprises waiting. simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture.election was quite the award winner at last year's hong kong film awards, winning for best actor (tony leung), best picture, best director (johnny to, who did heroic trio!!), and best screenplay. it also had nominations for cinematography, editing, film score (which i loved), and three more acting performances (including yam).

first off, i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence. i say unfortunately, because after seeing election 2 first, election seems a bit of a disappointment. both films are gangster epics that are similar in form. and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema... it's just not nearly as good as it's sequel.in the first election installment, we are shown the two competitors for chairman; big d and lok. after a few scenes of discussion amongst the "uncle's" as to who should have the chairman title, they (almost unanimously) decide that lok (simon yam) will helm the triads. suffice to say this doesn't go over very well with competitor big d (tony leung ka fai) and in a bid to influence the takeover, big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side. this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war. lok is determined to become chairman but won't become official until he can recover the "dragon head baton", a material representation of the chairman's power. the current chairman, whistle (chung wang) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first.much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton. as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides, which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election, which involves an underling named jet (nick cheung), a machete, and lots of bad guys. nick cheung's presence is attention grabbing to say the least... i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election, as he does deliver more of jet's character in the sequel.while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance, i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film's actors. election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting. simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo, tony leung ka fai, and the under-appreciated suet lam. there really aren't any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they're watching real gangsters.although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to's eye for the camera. there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots, as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles. all of which makes election, above all, a great looking film.my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election. it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren't integral to the plot. while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles, underlings, and police officers crowding the storyline. maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad, or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more. bottom line- all in all, this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast, excellent direction, and leisurely pacing that packs a punch. it's just a little more complicated than it needed to be.

it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films, but i think it's the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena. it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku's yakuza opus the yakuza papers (aka battles without honour and humanity), in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic, dark and gritty. but it's also a johnnie to film, and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur.every two years the hk triad elects a new boss. only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police. that's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that. as in the yakuza papers, there's a great deal of scheming, back-stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances (sometimes all it takes is a phone call - in one of the most memorable scenes i've seen in recent time) which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict. fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect. election is not as action-oriented as one might expect; although it is violent. and i'm not talking about the glossy, glamour version of hollywood violence. this is dark and grim. to's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims; after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not.if you're familiar with to's style, then you should know what to expect. the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. the cinematography is great, slick and dark in equal measures, utilizing dark hues (brown, dark green and orange) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it. in the end, election occupies a peculiar place. it's not exactly a character study and it's not an action-oriented gangster film. it explores a situation (the election and its aftermath), but does so in style, and is both realistic and romanticized (the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather).

this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety. those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides.it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren't familiar with hong kong films, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one. i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story-wise but overall a good crime film. some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east. people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior. it's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film.

johnnie to's election has some cool music on the opening creditsand a nice opening credits' design too, a kaleidoscope of chinese characters and those asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff; as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored. i have found about to from bishop seraphim sigrist and was quite eager to see a to movie. the one with which i began, election, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsmoderately and also essentially violent; the story of an asian godfather's scheming, it uses a puzzle play of elements, violent facts from the mobsters' lives, the race for the scepter, true details, and as with coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable. the performances are reasonably amusing and colorful.election is well made in the enjoyable, somewhat careless style of the hong kong fare; the ending is bitter, true, straight and will scare the kids.

i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival, where i went when i was in hollywood, that this film was in screening. basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up, so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this. the struggle is between "candidates" lam lok (simon yam) and big d (tony leung ka fai) for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society. also starring louis koo as jimmy lee, nick cheung as jet, cheung siu fai as mr. so, lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun. there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments, just about enough action, apart from maybe when the cops get involved, but a sequel followed, so it's a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller. very good!

i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes, dude, i was wrong. "election" is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama, taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals. characters are constantly on the move, and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider, it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. although there's hardly any action, the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality. cool movie that deserves more attention, and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit.

the first of two films by johnny to, this film won many awards, but none so prestigious as a cannes golden palm nomination.the triad elects their leader, but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations.tony leung ka fai (zhou yu's train, ashes of time redux) is big d, who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes, even if it means a war. well, war is not going to happen as that is bad for business. big d will change his tune or...good performances by simon yam, louis koo and ka tung lam (infernal affairs i & iii), along with tony leung ka fai.whether masons, made men in the mafia, or members of the wo sing society, the ceremonies are the same; fascinating to watch.to be continued...

personally, i find the movie to be quite a good watch. it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized.not only that, it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads.overall, the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture. nevertheless, the movie stays true to the real world, thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens.i'd recommend this movie to any triad/mafia movie fan. another good watch would be dragon squad. that movie has more guns than this, as in this movie there's more knives than guns (in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun).

despite a tight narrative, johnnie to's election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved. some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel, election 2: harmony is a virtue, but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions (though not the violence) in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call. it's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander.simon yam, all too often a variable actor but always at his best under to's direction, has possibly never been better in the lead, not least because tony leung's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful.

election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by johnnie to.to marvellously casted simon yan and tony leung kar fai as lok and big d, as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for ho sing society, a 100 year old trial society.while lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times, big d is not only impatient, but also thinks that he is on top of everything. lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. to have the total control of the gang, the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a dragon baton, which represents power and authority. big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. he ordered his man to get the baton before it falls onto the hands of lok.while big d is getting the baton, lok has other plans for him.this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. johnnie to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie, where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. however, no single bullet is used, hardly any gangfights are involved in election. it's the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest.apart from maggie shiu, the only actress in election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie, masculinity rules the whole movie. louis koo and nick cheung, who was seen in to's previous film, are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively. together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script, it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes fil festival 2005.election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie.

this film really deserves more recognition than its getting. it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. this film is a movie goers film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end. it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting, martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china. it features an arrangement of great characters, actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film. all in all 8/10 great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action(there is action by the way) so it loses some points for that.

i must admit, i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of 'cut' last night, though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem. i am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found 'cut' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody/comedy films of late.my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could. i am certain this was intended as humour....hoping this was intended as humour.and of course, there was the gore.the use of the 'customised' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. in short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth.the appearance of both kylie minogue (short that her appearance was) and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as simon bossell ('the castle') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician.all in all, i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end.loved it. go see it!

australia's first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang. and a stab. and a slice. and a scream or two. and plenty of blood, frights, red herrings and lots of laughs.in fact, there's lots of first surrounding cut - it's the first script of dave warner's to be produced, although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation; it's the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall; and it's also the first film for producer martin fabinyi. and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time, they sure know their stuff.cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film, hot blooded, that was never finished because its director, hilary (kylie minogue), was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film.despite their lecturer (who was assistant director on the night hilary died) warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies, director raffy (jessica napier) and producer hester (sarah kants) decide to go ahead and complete the film. they put together a crew and manage to get the original star, vanessa turnbill (molly ringwald), to return to australia - in fact, to the original location - to complete hot blooded  14 years after shooting shut down.of course, this being a slasher film, lots of bloodletting ensues  long with plenty of laughs, a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack. cut shows that australia can make a good, mass-market horror film just as well as hollywood.it's a finely crafted feature, with excellent special effects, a taut plot and a killer - scarman - that's a welcome addition to the ranks of michael, jason and freddy.

i was really excited about seeing this film. i thought finally australia had made a good film.. but i was wrong.this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever. i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie.the acting was terrible (especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent), and the plot was also pretty bad.when i first heard about this film coming out, i thought that the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheesy film "stab" in scream 2), but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie.warning!!! major spoilers!!!probably the worst thing about the film was the ending. i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was.. but the killer wasn't even human.. which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie.don't see this film.. you'll probably be disappointed!

i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously, basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job.. there seems to be another movie coming out like that too, umm... scary movie?? well this is aussie, and original!!! jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting! i hope to see more of them. molly ringwald was a good move, and kylie was an even better move. the impossible princess was queen of the screen!! i recommend seeing this flick, as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy, hilary and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago.

personally, i enjoyed cut thouroughly. it was the first time i've seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick. a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films.with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything. i didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies. it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street, not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief. i think it's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres.cut was original, scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun. i'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious. it did what i expected it to do, entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying. i enjoyed it.

i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it, which was sometime last year. anyway i got to see today, and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so. i thought that the movie was pretty good. but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created, i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends: final cut, i almost died it. mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved. cut is 100 times better than ul:final cut. the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes. the killer kicks mo f***ing ass.i give cut a 8 out of 10

it isn't the worst film ever made, the actors aren't apalling and the script and director are not completely inept. it isn't the best film ever made, the actors aren't excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant.it falls somewhere in the middle. a fun somewhere. an enjoyable, well constructed somewhere.no need to say "don't take it seriously" or "so bad its good" or "it wasn't scary". none of these comments are relevant. cut has atmosphere. it's that atmosphere which is actually very unique, and the one really original aspect of the movie, which personally is what makes the film, for me.

"cut" is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do. most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the old creepy house, the woods, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of gore, and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex (that's hardly a spoiler).the set-up is simplicity itself: film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher "masterpiece", unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast. this also neatly - okay, messily - disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel. they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines. the rest of the cast fit their roles well, especially the lovely jessica napier, who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her.there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments, and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace. it also has an appropriate low budget look, including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate. good soundtrack, too. if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre. probably a bit of both.

this is not a bad movie. it follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is the movie within a movie, the well known actress running for her life in the first scene. this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose, and manage to do something new, and interesting with it. it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack.so this might be an example of what the genre has become. cut hits all the marks, and is actually scary in some parts. i liked it i gave it an eight.

this is surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. all the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy. the finale was really cool, as i loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well, plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable!. it's decently made and written, and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. this killer didn't mess around, and i loved it, and slasher fans(like myself) should really enjoy this film, plus the opening was really wicked too, with them filming the movie!. this is a surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and i say it's well worth the watch!. the direction is good. kimble rendall does a good! job here with solid camera work, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. the acting is solid!. molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and i had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, i'm surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!. frank roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, creepy and had one hell of a mask, and this guy didn't mess around, he was fantastic!. kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine. rest of the cast are fine. overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5

for a slasher flick,this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre.yes it is predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree,people die,yada yada yada.however there are some good positives in this film.first off,i really liked the mask the nut job wore.it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique(although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made)also,the genesis of the bad due is something i haven't seen before,and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept,as far as i know.i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko,for most of the murders.the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre,but that'a small concern.the movie does not take itself seriously,which is something most slashers suffer from.oddly enough,while watching the movie,i was reminded of the early "friday the 13th films,which did take themselves seriously.there are a few concerns about this movie.in several scenes,the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons.by this,i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot,and also the way he walked.of bigger concern,however is a scene very close to the end,where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance(actually a complete rip off)of another famous horror titan.and in the very last scenes,we have our scumbag,once again,looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned.in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon in the slasher genre. these scenes were weak and unoriginal(obviously).by the way,the movie is set in australia,so if you're a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent(like me)you'll be in heaven.if you not,than it just might grate on you.one other great thing about this movie:beautiful kylie minogoue(just don't get too attached to her)there is one non aussie accent,courtesy of molly ringwald.overall,there are more reasons to watch than not.i enjoyed it and had some fun.so,i have to give "cut" 8/10,which may seem too high to some people.

twelve years ago, production stopped on the slasher flick "hot blooded" since almost everyone on the set started dying. now, a couple of film students have decided to finish the film, despite the fact that there's a rumor that the film is cursed. well, they're about to find out that some curses are real.when scream was released, every country seemed to want to cash in on its success, even australia. the concept, which today has been done to death (a slasher film within a slasher film) was at the time relatively cool and original. this movie was released right before urban legends: final cut and scream 3 (well not in the us but in australia) so it felt like the first movie with this concept. when urban legends 2 was released, most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn't even good, the movie flopped disastrously. now, cut is not the best slasher flick ever, and nor does it try to be. it knows that it's a rip-off, and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role. but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story, they've decided to rip-off some 80s slasher flicks like "nightmare on elm street" as well and surprisingly enough, this actually works. the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer! and instead of trying to scare the audience to death, they've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie. there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn't able to fully ignore, the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie. spoiler ahead; i mean, they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene? it makes no sense i tell you. end of spoilers. all in all, cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip-offs that never made it big. i'm surprised that this one never got a sequel, but i guess it simply came out too late. suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares. cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it's completely ludicrous.

when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure-type movies, the first thing i think of are '80s slasher flicks. really bad slasher flicks. the formulaic type of film, where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made.flash forward to the late '90s/early '00s. the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996's "scream". like in the '80s, these films were formulaic, masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as "hip, tongue-in-cheek parodies" of the original slasher flicks. of this recent blend of "hip parody" neo-slasher flicks, the only one worth seeing is the low-budget, direct-to-video "cut".like most of the other "new" slasher flicks, "cut" relies on the production of a slasher flick, in this case a fictional 1985 film "hot blooded", to make its commentary on the genre. "hot blooded" never finished production, because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer, scarman, a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark, pupil-less eyes. now, 12 years later, a group of film students, whose professor was involved in the production, have decided to go into the vaults, tap the original surviving actress, and finish the film. but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot, "scarman" returns and someone dies. to quote the tagline, will they finish the film before it finishes them?this all sounds really bad, and to a degree it is (really, is there such a thing as a good slasher flick?). there is no character development (the "new" director is revealed to be the daughter of "hot blooded"'s original director, whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled; this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot, yet it's never mentioned again) and, like in all other slasher flicks, there are just too many bodies to care about. the actors aren't great, even by direct-to-video standards, but most are having fun with their characters (and for those who aren't, it's inadvertent character acting, since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on "hot blooded"), particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman. "cut"'s climax has no big "who dunnit" unmasking of the killer like in the "scream" films. it doesn't have the gimmick killings of the "urban legend" films. what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a "this way we can write a sequel if it sells well" ending. but that's par for the course.by any sensible viewing standards, this is a horrible movie that should be avoided, but this "quality" is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre, and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo-slasher flicks.

a horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well. it's about a masked killer. the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew. he goes crazy and kills two people. he's killed himself and the film is never finished. twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it--but there's a curse. people who try and finish it are killed themselves. the students ignore that. guess what happens next?the plot is old hat but this isn't bad...for what it is (a low budget slasher film). it's well-made with a young and fairly talented young cast. no one is great but no one is terrible either. it also avoids the obligatory (and needless) female nude scenes. it moves quickly, the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence. also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress.no great shakes but not bad at all. i give it a 7.

this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war germany utterly captivating. you get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits. the plot necessarily comes second, but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised. just wonderful.

trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn't yet seen. renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse. my son is so jaded with current "b" science fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet.it must be noted i didn't see anything about cypher when it was released in australia. it must have been very quiet or i just missed it.well this was a really pleasant surprise! this is also no b movie. it's not a "blockbuster" of the epic variety and doesn't try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it's plot to be fully savoured.the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view, but they get it right at it's 2nd appearance, & that aside everything else is top notch. in any case the affects are secondary.i won't give anything away about the plot. the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct (though with very different content).just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke. the actor was born in cambridge england, and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect, it's a tad off key. see the final twist of the plot and you'll see why that is such a brilliant choice! and lucy liu is also just right with her "will she kiss me - will she shoot me" edge.i rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them.

don't read anything about this movie (especially nothing that could contain any spoilers). just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience. if you like to see an intelligent, twisted story: go, get the dvd and you'll truly not be disappointed. "cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business. it's about corporate secrets, how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them. the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness. cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what belongs the story and the ending - also much, much more satisfying than vincenzo natali's other movies "cube" and "nothing". actually it's one of the best movies i've ever seen (and that's something i really don't say this about every fifth well-made flick). sorry, can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience. just give it a chance. ;-)

"cypher" is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future. while thematically not complex, this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty, ruthlessness, and corporate conspiracy. to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf.the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man, morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative. after an initial briefing with digicorp's security chief, sullivan is then given a new identity (jack thursby) and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies. upon successfully completing his first assignment, sullivan/thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered. however, on one of his "business trips" he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster, (liu) whom he had met on his previous assignment, and from there things go extremely topsy-turvy. the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp's espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp's main competitors, thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies.((spoilers end here))what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes. vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic/household settings, while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover-up. i was also very impressed with jeremy northam. not too often have i seen him in the lead role, and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant. personally, i think he's one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn't been given more challenging roles. lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak-and-dagger tone. additionally, the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job, however, my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated. for example, i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second "wife." overall, this is a cleverly developed cloak-and-dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted. with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work, this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future. i'm surprised that i had never watched this "hidden gem" before. this is a brilliant, not-too-overly complicated spy thriller, and therefore i'm giving it a 9 out of 10.

cypher is a clever, effective and eerie film that delivers. its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands. although one could immediately label the film a science fiction, there is a little more to it. it has it's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir/detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story.the film, overall, plays out like it's some kind of nightmare; thus building and retaining a good atmosphere. we're never sure of what exactly is going on, we're never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we're not entirely sure of certain people, similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i haven't seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before, bar terry gilliam's brazil. going with the eeriness stated earlier, cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective, noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there's something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well.there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story. the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster (liu), who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale, can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero: people whom appear as friends actually aren't, people who say they're helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look. despite a lot of switching things around, twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they're not carried out; the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu's character  and she's trying to help out(!) the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage, spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents. the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini-cold war; something that resembles the u.s.a. and the u.s.s.r. in their war of word's heyday and it really pulls through given the black, bleak, often cgi littered screen that i was glued to. what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and foster's own motivation this sequence disappears because he's breaking away from the computerised, repetitive, controlled life that he's being told to live and is branching out.cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film. to say it resembles the first jason bourne film, only set in the sci-fi genre, isn't cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities; despite them both being released in the same year. like i mentioned earlier, there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict, you will find yourself enjoying this film.

cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill sci-fi flick. the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. the close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. the sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. the technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, however, the director makes good use of the props. the character development is intentionally shallow. the main character, jeremy northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. it's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end.

damn, i've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still don't get bored watching it.the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me.the cgis are quite bad imho, but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just... just a genius perfect combination for such a movie. the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good.however although, the movie had little flaws, like e.g. sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too "slow", but i don't mean the scenic parts by that, i totally loved those.also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story, like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps, where all their data is saved, and has this conversation with the guy down there... but that may also just be me :d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized, they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and "louder" but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again...

this movie is a gem because it moves with soft, but firm resolution.i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there, it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace. it's not about explosions, car chases, or flying bullets. you must be patient and instead, note the details here. it's sedate because that's what the main character is. the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds.i will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching. the plot is what you've read from the other postings: an average white-collar guy, seeking change and adventure, signs on for a corporate spy job. just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data. take it from there.this movie starts at a surreal walk-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential, underlying suburban paranoia.then it begins to accelerate.the acting on all parts is superb-- and yes, some of the acts are caricature characters. but they all fit, and they entertain. and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft, soft key sinister theme: all is not right at the beginning.and at the end: all is not what it seems.get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one-- and turn up the sound: this movie wants you to listen.

this is my first comment! this is a fantastic movie! i watched it all by luck one night on tv. at first 5 minutes i thought it was a b movie, but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was.i suggested to some friends to see the movie, only to tell me that it was a bad b movie. how wrong. superficial critiques.i think that the movie is almost a product of genius! the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time.

i've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot. but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now, and i wan tell it's one the best movies i've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!! what you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie, if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end. the end is what makes this movie so good, you can't expect it.congratulations to the producer !

who can watch a movie, look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed. that woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress. that's a tough combination to find now a days. and jeremy northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. my advice to hollywood is : "use him more".now about the movie: i watched it in one of my graveyard shift. i don't recommend that to anyone. it's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming. i'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this is spoilment enough.now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. i love the dark mystic story, the actors did a good job & i love the directors (natali) work in the past. there's not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty risky. you know what, i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this. then again, 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement.

wow. one of the greatest movies i have ever - ever seen.absolutely loved it! before the opening credits were done i was glued to the screen.it's a sci-fi thriller - and edge of your seat whodunnit. incredible.i wish'd it would never end.lucy liu is a throwaway role. anyone could have played it. the lead actor, jeremy northram was the perfect geeky guy. this movie appeals to me who loved war games, sneakers, and track down.incredible!8-22-06. walt d in lv

it's actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond, as i'm sure he wouldn't be able to keep up in the nowadays spying-business, where fast cars have been replaced with hi-tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment. "cypher" is a pretty inventive sci-fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible. you know the trend in these types of movies: nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot, the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again. the events in "cypher" supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world, where the major companies don't really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other's thunder. company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity, only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor, the sunways corporation. sunways, on the other hand, constantly tries to unmask the digisoft-rats and recruit them again as double-spies. in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan; a seemingly colorless thirty-something employee who's been selected by sebastian rooks (the über-spy) to diddle the secret policies of both companies. trust me, it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali (the dude from "tube") carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters. the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem "seconds"  starring rock hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style. even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60's film, with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless. there's also plenty of great action and suspense, most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing-techniques during boring conventions. the middle section of the film drags a little, mainly because you already realize that it's all just building up towards multiple misleading plot-twists, and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not-so-distant future. jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side. regular director's choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c. dunn. "cypher" is well made and adrenalin rushing sci-fi entertainment, highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time.

this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp. this wimpy guy, morgan (jeremy northam) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy. he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies' plans. instead, morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by lucy liu) and pretty much being double-crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent. how will morgan get himself out of this? can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster (played by lucy liu)? and more importantly, can morgan make it out alive? wow! what a nifty movie! i was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie. it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgan's fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive. the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgan's head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening. morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished. from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man actively fighting for his life.the ending, wow, the ending is incredible! the twist is so much fun! it left me gasping and cheering like crazy! good performances from all around, especially from jeremy natham, lucy liu and nigel bennett.i highly recommend this film!

this is the definite lars von trier movie, my favorite, i rank it higher than "breaking the waves" or the latest "dancer in the dark"... i simply love the beauty of the picture...the framing is so original; acting is wonderful, a must see.

if you came into the film with expectations, throw them away now, because no amount of hype will do this film justice.to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal. it's a spy thriller, has elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative, mind-bending plot twists, and gorgeous cinematography.a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative, both in good and bad ways, of other movies. but as they say, every story cribs from shakespeare, so once you can get past that, you're in for a hell of a ride.you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are portions (read: the elevator) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals. don't misconstrue that to mean it's on the same level as cheesy sci-fi channel movies, though, because this is on a much higher level.if you're looking for action, you should turn away. this is pure psychology. but if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience, by all means, do it now! watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it!

canadian director vincenzo natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube, which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s. it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. i've been eagerly awaiting natali's follow-up, and although its taken five years for him to mount another project, i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait. cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world, and how through a completely logical chain of events, finds himself in a situation beyond his control.i don't want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down. it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head. cypher is such a film.morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet, is hired by the company digicorp. they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars. to his bewilderment, they are unbelievably boring. covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.while morgan is waiting for one seminar, he runs into rita foster (an impeccably cast lucy liu), the definition of an ice maiden. she gives him the brush-off, but there is something to her he finds irresistible. that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in. when rita turns up at another one of morgan's seminars, she tells him his life is not what it appears. and i'm not saying anything more about the plot. to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us, as well as the tortuous path that's so much fun to follow.as with cube, natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown. and cypher follows similar patterns. but it's not a carbon copy of cube. it has it's own inspiration.cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge. when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him.one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is. where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns, cypher is also on a low budget, but natali economises it as much as he can, allowing him to broaden the horizon, and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity.natali's direction is exceptional, with a deft hand on the reins. there are some amazing camera angles from above, such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast, robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside. all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture, which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir.the acting is uniformly excellent throughout. jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity. his performance is excellent because it's so modulated. he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes. from a clinical, spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity.david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube. he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black. his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia. he is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents, and it's a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly acted by hewlett. all he has to do is look at morgan, and we're drawn into his complex mind game.but it's lucy liu who's the scene stealer here. too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect. but in cypher, she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove. rita is an aloof, guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish. i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control, and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone.things come to a very gratifying end, that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did. but morgan deserves his happy ending. after he's been put through the ringer like this, i cheered for him in the final scene. it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes.cypher succeeds on all counts. engaging, shocking, always entertaining, it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't. and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix.a fine follow-up from natali. and now i'm a committed fan of the man. superb stuff!

director vincenzo natali's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which, although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration, manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience.morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife, decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high-tech company digi corp. his job is to travel to conferences across the country (under the assumed identity of jack thursby) and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses, via a nifty little electronic pen-gizmo.in reality, however, the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities. morgan, along with his fellow conference attendees, is being brainwashed. the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma, during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities. once they are totally convinced that they are someone else, they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies, where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion.but digi corp's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire rita foster (lucy liu), who opens morgan's eyes to what is really happening. she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques. she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby, then he will be 'eliminated'. morgan plays along, and applies for a job at rival business sunways.however, arriving at his new workplace, he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy. fortunately, the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent.from hereon in, things get progressively more complicated; the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone. in an exciting finale, all eventually becomes clear (but only if you've been following events very carefully).director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget. he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast; jeremy northam,in particular, is fantastichis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection.cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects, high rise and necropolis.

listen, i don't care what anybody says, as cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie. cypher is not, i repeat not, a b movie. cypher is an absolute masterpiece. suffice it to say, i am a connoisseur of the world's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight. i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is. cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made. the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime. in fact, i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me. in fact, i've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. other critics, of whom some downplayed the movie, have no idea as to what the hell they're talking about. don't listen to the haters. and actually, for the most part, reviews of cypher have been largely positive. and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie, but it is also a fantastic movie. cypher is the kind of movie that's so advanced and so magnificently crafted, that it's over the heads of most critics and all the cynics. there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever. again, the cinematography, the backdrops, the technology, the storyline, and the acting are all 100% world-class top notch. naturally, i won't give anything away. this is not a spoiler. and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters, i believe quite the opposite. cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way. cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves. blade runner, 1984, brave new world, total recall, logan's run, jason bourne and impostor and deja vu... look out! cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research, 5 star eternal spy movie hall of fame. cypher is counterespionage at it's absolute best. hands down and hats off. nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. the future is now.

in a near future, the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan (jeremy northam) is hired by digicorp, a huge corporation, to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors, sunways. along his training, morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures. in one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster (lucy liu), who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be. morgan acknowledges a new reality, where he does not know who can be trusted.the unknown "cypher" was a great surprise for me. this movie has not been released in brazil, but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex, with many plot points, and with great screenplay, direction and performances. in the very last twist, i recalled arnold schwarzenegger's "total recall". this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once, and i really did not like the last scene, when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea. in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic "cube", and this second work i see is also stunning. my vote is eight.title (brazil): not available

this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci-fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali. the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen. the film is superbly shot, i love the cinematography in this, it feels fresh and original. plot-wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall, dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci-fi stuff. morgan sullivan (jeremy northam) is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp, a large technological corporation. he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do. it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen. it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife. after his first job things become strange, his habits change, his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares. he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster (played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu.) he takes an instant attraction to. however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems. he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp. the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies. sullivan, whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain-dead day dream while the speakers drone on (the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages.) suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else. digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence. sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby. digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it, they now effectively control what these spies do, except for sullivan. when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp, make sullivan a double agent. they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down. samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system. the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn. he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him. when a mysterious third party becomes involved, the person it is revealed that foster works for, sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent, who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for. the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires. the cast are great. northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent. he brings a great visual aspect to his performance, his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby. lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact. the rest of the cast are also good.director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci-fi flick cube, has a real visual flair. he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look. for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively. the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci-fi films, it is up there with them. the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this, that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident. the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along. this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states. ****1/2

this filmfour funded sci-fi movie is most definitely a must see. while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise; it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive, despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film. it's good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they aren't getting wide releases), and cypher is refreshing for that reason. the plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher's mystery. the plot follows morgan sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. however, his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita...this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future. this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type, with it's only real close affiliate being kubrick's a clockwork orange. the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing. you never quite know where you are with the plot, which serves in making it all the more intriguing. the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars; jeremy northam and lucy lui. northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale, and does well with his role. lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent, but she has a look about her that just fits this movie.cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an inventive recent sci-fi film; cypher is the way to go.

jeremy northam's characterization of the stuttering, mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch. his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face, neck and lips. no matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. love also cannot be "brainwashed in" with either of his two fake wives. in gradual stages, he begins to dispense with his glasses, to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses. the music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriately driving at times. the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi "film noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu's portrayal, whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states, the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith, some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part. she is just no match for northam's talents, but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author.

you'll notice by the stars i've given this great film that '...before you see it the first time,' is implied. i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much great coming in). i'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too. still, it did.this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. the entire film is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns. i would have given this film 10/10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. i don't hold that against this film too much, but i don't think it deserves a perfect score.lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). i think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed, as well.jeremy northam does really well, at first, as quite a geeky corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. however, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. i know some fans of clive owen, jude law, or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this, but northam would/could/should fit that bill. he's suave and cultured. he's got a great bond posture and voice. i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it, and rather down-to-earth, as well.great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films.

there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers. this film also included one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes in recent years. the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller.although the plotting of the film was convoluted, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed.in 1949, george orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state, which would control minds and diminish human liberty. it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the state, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.

when the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration. that didn't really happen, surprisingly, and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear. but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.the story is of a morgan sullivan, who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called digicorp. his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company, while under an assumed and false identity. his home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing. however, things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what's going on, he starts to question who he actually is. this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up...twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated, and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable.it's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future, and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat.highly recommended.

i enjoyed watching cliffhanger, at the beginning when that woman (sarah) was full of terror when she was slipping, i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see, your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster. i did like watching cliffhanger, i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he'll be known as playing rambo and rocky.

this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle. stallone is gabe walker. cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists. renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie. stallone needed this role to get back on track. snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than finnish man. action is good! music in the film is spectacular. the bad guy is john litghow, other stars micheal rooker ( the portrait of serialkiller), janine turner ( strong medicine). the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie. overall good movie ****/*****remember extreme ääliöt: special collectors edition, with good extras. comig soon in finland straight to video.

good action show, but nothing new. this one took place high in the mountains, which showed some nice scenery and such. one man takes on a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks butt. it could have been called "rambo goes to the rockies", it was that pat. it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror. not a bad picture, but just same ol', same ol'.

this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded.this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights,a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well,an exciting plot,and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways.the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play.the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human,much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters.they chose to humanise stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style,weakens the excitement factor.also,the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times.the script should have been more realistic and less "talky".another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses.they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie.instead,they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala "a-team" tv series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.this movie had a lot of all time great potential.crisper action sequences,better dialogue and more rambo/rocky style emotion/determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level.i know this was not stallone's fault.i sense the movie's director wanted to tone down stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer.sill a good movie though........

this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie!stallone was good as always!michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain!the music is fantastic especially the theme!the movie is action packed and never dull!if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger,you won't be disappointed!

cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor. it's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars. it has great action sequence's, edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies.

after the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber (michelle joyner). eight months has passed... the rocky mountain rescue receive a distress call set by a brilliant terrorist mastermind eric quaien (john lithgow). quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside. two experienced climbers walker (sylvester stallone) and tucker (micheal rooker) and a helicopter pilot (janine turner) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by quaien and his men. now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek. while quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped tucker to find the money. once tucker finds the money, tucker will be dead. against explosive firepower, bitter cold and dizzying heights. walker must outwit quaien for survival.directed by renny harlin (driven, mindhunters, a nightmare on elm street 4:the dream master) made an entertaining non-stop action picture. this film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action picture with plenty of dark humour as well. this was one of the biggest hits of 1993. this is one of harlin's best film. lithgow is a terrific entertaining villain. stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller. this is probably harlin's best work as a filmmaker.dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd has an running commentary track by the director with comments by stallone. dvd also has technical crew commentary as well. dvd has behind the scenes featurette, two deleted scenes with introduction by the director and more. do not miss this great action film. screenplay by micheal france (fantastic four) and actor:stallone (the rocky series). based on a premise by john long. excellent cinematography by alex thomson, b.s.c. (alien³, demolition man, legend). oscar nominated for best sound, best sound editing and best visual effects. panavision. (****/*****).

after the success of die hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of 'die hard on a .....' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. that is what they did with cliffhanger, die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly 'stop or my mom will shoot' stallone's career.cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. all in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! however, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.you've got to love john lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, rex linn as travers.he may of been henry in 'portrait of a serial killer' but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' and whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like ralph waite's frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.mention too must go to former 'london's burning' actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, hal needed a good kicking.so forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! and if you're looking for qaulen, he's the one wearing the helicopter.

forget credibilityyou must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats, being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed, and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons... especially when renny harlin is directing."cliffhanger " is no exception. but the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin ( janine turner ), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall, but also rex linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, leon, craig fairbrass ) good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.as roger ebert wrote ( about another film )"it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much."

the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo. but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion.the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before.the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes, the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years.

this movie is just great. it's entertaining from beginning to the end, you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics.sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy gabe walker. together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker. and then, john lithgow, one of the best performances i've seen of him as a villain.and the fact that 75% of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action! brilliant movie!

cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director renny harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains. sylvester stallone is impressive as gabe walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief. the rest of the cast including john lithgow, michael rooker, janine turner, rex linn, caroline goodall, and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. the action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. the villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. if you're a big fan of harlins or stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, thrills, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.

was this based on a comic-book? a video-game? a drawing by a 3 year-old? there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. nothing. we have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ("tango-tango"). a film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. oh, yes: and the unintentional humour.the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a "swell" time. then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. and then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell. stallone's melodramatic exchange with turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clichéd, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. the entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. after the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker. they send stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). do these gangsters want their money fetched or not??? very silly. apparently they don't trust stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using rooker as a hostage. nevertheless, our gangsters make stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. everyone convinced? good. you'd better be. otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone.the old guy who flies the chopper... how the hell did he fall for the trap? firstly, he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard stallone's and rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. "get off my back!" lithgow: "i haven't even started climbing on your back." or, lithgow to stallone: "we had a deal, but now we only have each other!" and as for lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. they are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on. stallone co-wrote this thing. i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. i'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i.q.

since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it. the setting has a lot to do with it (the colorado i know would be jealous), but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes. there has not been a movie i can compare this too. john lithgow plays a smart villain, but i love how he is completely out of his element--he has to follow tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting. this is an action movie at it's best. i don't think i'll see another that is so entertaining.you don't need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie. it just has to keep you captivated, not shell-shocked.

to be honest, i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time. but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater. big mistake ! because the #1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and #2 is the cinematography. try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system. the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential). the more i see it, the more i like it.it's definitely one of renny harlin's best movie. this guy knows about action. die hard 2, the long kiss good bye, etc. and it's particularly good in this movie. the special effect are great and spectacular. stallone really needed that movie get back with success. still good to see him !

i'm far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role. and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though i feared the worst.when gabe (stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. for almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. at least, that's what the rangers believe. in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. i know him best from the tv-series "3rd rock from the sun", but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. overall the acting is ok, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. i loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests... perhaps that's why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. i give it a 6.5/10. if you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.

watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as "die hard in a /on a." cliffhanger is "die hard on a mountain," and pretty good, for what it is.but unlike passenger 57 and under siege, which are decent die hard clones on their own terms, cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that, in their immensity, threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks.years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations, cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings.the opening sequence has already received substantial praise, all of which it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening. not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke (and which he repeated in deep blue sea), or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face, can dim the sequence's power.the next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet. as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin, the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected. as roger ebert has observed, the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. so far as i know, no one was killed in the making of this movie (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot. but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin (or more likely one of the second-unit directors) knew exactly where to place the camera.i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain, and at the same time actually feels that pain. the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths: he plays an older, more vulnerable kind of action hero, giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself.in contrast to many of today's post-matrix, comic book-inspired action heroes, stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities. in cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes to death, and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another. he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut, particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains.it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness: when i first saw this movie as a teenager, i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust (or rather, the ice); at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold-blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise.lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter, but he's fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue: in one scene, looking at his hostages stallone and rooker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, he actually says "you, stay! you, fetch!" even a better actor, such as anthony hopkins, might have had trouble with that line.even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside, it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show.early in the movie, for example, lithgow openly says to one of his men "retire [stallone] when he comes down." no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously: his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face, and this precipitates a gripping tug-of-war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg.lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means, but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor.done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or (at times) a western, cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film.besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before, the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative. finally, harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless, since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes.it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies, because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later. but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time, without a sequel: there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already. there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit: compared to that clinker, cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list.rating: 8 (very good, especially considering most of stallone's other movies.)

sly's best out and out action film. it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured. stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's, a definite genre classic. as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories. plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form. action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner, michael rooker and john lithgow. ****

wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge, an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker (stallone) comes back for his girlfriend jessie (janine turner), while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening, a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing stranded off the snowy peaks, and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash, the high-trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit unfortunately, gab and hall (michael rooker) have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake, and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (john lithgow),are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money with breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures, "cliffhanger" is definitely stallone's best action adventure movie

i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin. 'die hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. that's right, you little punks, 'cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.sly plays gabe walker, a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend, hal tucker (michael rooker), assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen (john lithgow). qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u.s. government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back...essentially, 'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone. just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. naturally, that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough, as stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease, and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. after all, isn't that what action movies are all about?'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. a showcase of great scenes and stunts. one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.'cliffhanger' is easily one of stallone's best efforts, definitely renny harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10

when i was six yo, i learned about a series called "los campeones", and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch "the champions" and "the avengers" once every week. i think that was the golden age of english series... (i already own the complete cycle of "the prisoner"!) but lasted also a few years later with "the tomorrow people", "the worst witch" (i just me, or this is "harry potter" in girl, of course, before as much as i want "the campions" to be in zone 1 or zone 4, i'm also waiting for "dr. who" (pack the whole series in a set of, uhm, maybe 300 dvd's, please, i couldn't expend more for it, 8), "people of tomorrow", and several other 'low budget', but great stories to be available within my reached zones. i speak and understand english, but not all my relatives do, including my parents, whom introduced me into these great stories... i hope someday, someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them... dubbed or subtitled, but in the same format i saw them. remember, zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set!

i wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history......i was hooked. the premise was pretty simple; two hardened nemesis agents, richard barrett and craig stirling ( william gaunt and stuart damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) doctor and biologist (sharron macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. whilst making their escape, their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio, thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come...the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived, one season run that has set it up for cult status.monty berman, the producer, was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in episodes such as "happening" ( a studio deputising for the australian outback) and the 'snow' sets of "operation deep freeze" and "the beginning" but if you can get past this, and focus on the characters and the story lines, the show was really a lot of fun. it had a great mix of adventure, and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt).the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig!!). they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. i have to say, i was always a richard barrett fan - i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross, and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv. i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since. however, craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too.the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with, including donald sutherland, jeremy brett, peter wyngarde, burt kwouk, anton rodgers, kate o'mara, jenny linden, paul eddington and colin blakely.notable episodes for me were : "auto kill", "the interrogation", "the fanatics", "the mission" and "the gilded cage" but i am sure every one has their personal favourites.if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time, or to re watch it after many years, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don't think i will ever tire of it.enjoy!

my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970's. we absolutely adored it. there was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual american re-runs (petticoat junction, green acres... you get the idea). it had a similar feel to the avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also british and in the spy/adventure genre).i would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. i've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence. but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.

well, what can i say, other than these people are super in every way. i quite like sharon mcreedy, i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes, i did not realise that they had made so many, i also think that it is a great shame, that they have not made any more. i wish that i got given these powers, imagine me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and being knocked out cold, then waking up in a special hospital. later on, i discover that my body has been enhanced. just like richard barrat. these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you cannot fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry. the music is well written, and to me, puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind, the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats, improved sight, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon. who i thought was beautiful and intelligent. when i was a boy, i had a huge crush on her!!!! now i can see why, on my dvd set. the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series. i also thought that trymane was a good boss, firm but he got things done!

monty berman and dennis spooner followed up 'the baron' with this, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted 'the six million dollar man'. it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster, and i enjoy watching it still. stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett, while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready. the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne. by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson, terry nation and brian clemens, while spooner's own 'the interrogation' compared favourably with 'the prisoner'. i regret that there was never a second series; the concept had so much life left in it. would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron's affections? what if tremayne had learned of the champions' powers? did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw? we never found out, alas.

i was 10 years old when this show was on tv. by far it was my favorite. the actors were very credible. alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous.... i just order the dvd (15 episodes). they didn't have super-powers. they just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight). the 3 actors were very good in their rolls, very believable. there was a good story in each episode. at the time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was suppose to be good, and the characters performs were great. there was no fancy stuff, like in other shows. they didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff.

the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing, that is what i guess makes him so mean. i don't think most men will like this movie, especially if they ever cheated on their wife. this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end. but then, there you have it, a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say, "hokie as hell." a pretty good movie until the end. ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning. and then there is the aftermath of what happened. guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending. i'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end.

this film made john glover a star. alan raimy is one of the most compelling character that i have ever seen on film. and i mean that sport.

successful self-made married businessman harry mitchell (a superbly steely performance by roy scheider) has an adulteress fling with sweet'n'sexy young stripper cini (the gorgeous kelly preston). harry's blackmailed by a trio of scummy low-life hoods -- sleazy porno theater manager raimy (a splendidly slimy john glover), antsy strip joint owner leo (well played by robert trebor) and crazed pimp bobby shy (a frightfully intense clarence williams iii) -- who have videotaped his affair with cini. when harry refuses to pay up, the hoods kill cini and make it look like harry did it. this in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between harry and the hoods. director john frankenheimer, adopting a tough script based on elmore leonard's gritty crime thriller novel, expertly maintains a steady snappy pace, delivers plenty of gripping tension, and effectively creates a compellingly seedy'n'sordid atmosphere. the leads are all uniformly excellent, with stand-out supporting turns by ann-margret as harry's bitter neglected wife barbara, vanity as brash jaded prostitute doreen, and lonny chapman as harry's loyal business partner jim o'boyle. the tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout. the wickedly profane dialogue, jost vacano's glossy cinematography, gary chang's stirring score, the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well. as an added bonus, both vanity and preston take their clothes off. a very strong and satisfying little number that's well worth checking out.

life's going not to badly for harry mitchell, he's an ex-air force major (plus nifty little pension i imagine), who's raking in the cash for a patent he's developed (fusing titanium and steel via explosive process, creating super metal fit for nasa), and his wife of twenty-odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick. he's got a nice little pad in la. i like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream, and you get a good slice here, what with the restored silver jag (a series 1 e-type roadster) for him, and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her (as well as i'm sure other trinkets and boys toys). there's always got to be more though hasn't there? so harry let's himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans (you're only as old as the woman you're feeling). as in many films noir, one mistake, in an otherwise blotch-less life, leads to a downwards arc for harry.three blackmailers leech onto him. these are where the value are for me, great character actors playing very believable roles. bobby shy (played by clarence williams iii) is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers. he's reminiscent of pluto, the vicious black ex-con psychopath from carl franklin's well-regarded neo-noir "one false move" (1992). there's a similar character motivation i believe. both men have had enough of the man, and well pretty much everyone, in extremis. robert trebor plays leo franks, a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour, and $50 for a whole hour (did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount?). he's in over his head, and it's great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat, believable breakdown. john glover wins as alan raimy, who is the brains of the plot, an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui. he's a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie, including what i believe is a pretty well-implied rape (pay attention to his rap sheet readout, it's easily missed, and read between the lines for the motel scene with "slim").in common with one false move, though not exclusively, i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence.so far so good but i think there's a real problem with the film. harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his "tit in the wringer". my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider. roy scheider protagonists never lose, they're self-sure and smooth, but not in an annoying way. i feel i'm being asked to believe that his character is in peril, the movie relies on this for dramatic tension; however i didn't believe it. for me it's like being asked to believe that sandra bullock's character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama, or stephen seagal's character is going to get taken down by the baddies (did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value). roy scheider doesn't convince as an adulterer either, you don't feel any annoyance with him at all, his character is teflon-coated.it also felt like a movie that took some cuts. at 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped: harry's wife, ann margaret, is pretty much a cardboard cutout, an extension of harry, her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention. the effect that the affair has on harry's marriage isn't properly communicated. this could be a frankenheimer problem, he's not known for character development. i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs. there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film, but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better (no disrespect to the great roy scheider). the film felt short, even with the long running time, and i think could have taken some more fleshing out.but you really can't forget the sleaze, like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour.

52-pick up never got the respect it should have. it works on many levels, and has a complicated but followable plot. the actors involved give some of their finest performances. ann-margret, roy scheider, and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals. notable too are vanity, who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows, and kelly preston, who's character will haunt you for a few days. anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this.

this is a great "small" film. i say "small" because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a john woo film. great performances by roy scheider and the three "bad guys". john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. the film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around, it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens. wonderful ending, very positive. i never read the elmore leonard book, but it can't be much different from the film because it feels like i'm watching an elmore leonard movie.

this slick and gritty film consistently delivers. it's one of frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking "but i loved get shorty" you need to be punched in the face). in my opinion, no one captures the "feel" for leonard's characters better then john glover in 52 pick-up. the relocation of the story from detroit (novel) to hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights. be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are: swag, rum punch, cat chaser, city primeval, and 52 pick-up. my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate. i also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for dead bang and black sunday.

i've always liked this john frankenheimer film. good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of frankenheimer. his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference, he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant! you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made. i've always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance. clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out. frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts. what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? a guilty pleasure to say the least. vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance. a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn't be forgotten.

based on elmore leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action film. the story: a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals. roy schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit's got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath. i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action film. also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are kelly preston as the young bate for schieder's character. vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers. i'm glad to say that ann-margaret still hasn't lost it - this lady is a true babe. don't look at the rate of this film. i really don't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under-rated film. you will enjoy it, that's a promise. recommended a+.

spoilers!from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news, i wanted to see it. i don't remember who it was, or which local omaha newscast carried the review, but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going nebraskan. they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann-margret when she's swimming in the pool. glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth, using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out. i was hooked. there was one problem, though. i was only 13 years old at the time, and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable. let's just say, it was worth the wait!if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine, this movie is it. to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement. the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman. roy scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains. john glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. he's sleazy, funny at times, and always on the brink of doing something crazy. then there's robert trebor's (nice name, by the way!) character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme. he is a whimpering, sweating, coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models. then, you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy, a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason. who could forget the wake-up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear?after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against, scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation, that is until glover goes after his wife! the conflict is played out brutally, with virtually the entire cast getting shot, raped, or blown up. i don't know why i love this movie so much. it really should creep me out, but it doesn't. maybe it's because these characters are all interesting, and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try. it's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover's running around out in l.a. looking for trouble. just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle. "hey sport, have a nice day!"this film has plenty of shootouts, cool cars, great dialog (like the line in my opening statement), and decent acting. plenty of cameos by real life porno stars. look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover's place. another thing i must add: how hot are the women in this film??? wow! travolta did right by marrying kelly preston. yum! we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian. and ann-margret. what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty. 9 of 10 stars.so sayeth the hound.added feb 14, 2008: rip roy scheider!

before dogma 95: when lars used movies as art, not just a story. a beautiful painting about love and death. this is one of my favorite movies of all time. the color... the music... just perfect.

horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination. we all know that killers like freddy, jason, michael and even leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day. most of us don't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains. and let's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them. this is where imagination wins out over fact. horror, and most films in general, requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow. this usually isn't a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c. scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville. but what i do have a problem digesting ( without wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this film. to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself, but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed. there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is. but the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done, suspenseful, blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough. if the film would have offered me a different killer, then i would actually be raving about it. this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film, but believe me, anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me.john cassevetes plays dr. sam cordell. he and his daughter jenny ( played beautifully by erin flannery ) have just recently moved to this small new england town. cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died. we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour. her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed. again, i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway. cassevetes, it has to be mentioned, is strange to say the least. cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental. there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities. it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent, but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug. thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy. casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan. he has a deceptive smile and a virile, commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice. but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene. he just has that slimy, disingenuous, phlegmatic, uneasy way about him. he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film. i guess that is a credit to the writers, the director and to cassevetes himself. there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get-go. the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry. there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see, something or someone is watching them. when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck, the young woman wanders into the shed, just to play a prank. once she is there, she is attacked. the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail. hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in. he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding in the corner, and then smacko, the guy gets it. it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note.also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces. tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place, he has another dream. toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother, a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen.throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time, the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped. this is my first feeble (and careful) attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement. it just didn't strike the right chord.the incubus is a well done film. it is tense, tight and even most of the performances are very well done. i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders. but when you get through all that was good in the film, you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth. and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones. 7 out of 10-- this could have been a nine. too bad.

shocking, well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces.small town doctor tries to discover who, or what, is committing a series of violent sexual murders.incubus is a tight mystery, with some horrific murder sequences, that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist. the murder scenes are intense and gory, so this isn't a film for the squeamish! the direction of john hough, along with a bizarre music score, combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film. it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well. nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight.the cast isn't bad either. the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town. also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter, helen hughes as the town historian, and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen.all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated.*** out of ****

when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud.this is not steven kings best work. i thought that his best work was the shining. i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking. as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick. i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius. making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool. people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all. don't expect something from a movie that it isn't. it still in a general area wasn't that good. i still recommend people to watch the movie

there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else. maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable. but as i keep watching it over and over again, it never gets old, and i never get bored. from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending, there is something insane, sad and scary at the same time, and it keeps ringing in your head: sometimes dead is better! i don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again. all you need to know is it starts from point a (the most perfect situation for a happy american family) and step by step drowns to point b (which is, believe me, the very end of all joy). the music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be. like i said, sometimes dead is better!

overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct. the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts. i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie (because i hadn't found out about the movie yet) but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal-mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected. overall i give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall making sense) and for its bad parts (large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies).

personally, i absolutely love this movie and novel(i read the book first and decided to see the movie). first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. the acting is also great and i love the cast. judd crandall (plays fred gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. there are also a few corny lines thrown in there (idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh. the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie. not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again, i recommend this 100% to any horror fan!!

ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; they're a main part of a wide variety of horror films.this one, has a lot of them.still, it's stephen king, one of the best masters of horror. this movie was really good, just too predictable. and what horror movie doesn't have stupid people? this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken. pet semetary i found to be creepy a little. the way everything is set up was really spooky, but not terrifying. for the most part, the acting was somewhat believable, the suspense wasn't that suspenseful, but the entertainment level is set at a major rank; my eyes were practically glued to the screen.all stephen king fans must see this movie, but as for anyone else, expect an okay thriller.

probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet. not surprising, since king himself wrote the screenplay. the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house. one of the other residents is jud, a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area. one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. the other is a path leading to the pet sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. soon enough, ellie creed's cat, church, is found dead. luckily, this happens while the family, with the exception of louis(the father), is away for thanksgiving. jud takes louis to another burial ground, beyond the pet sematary, where church is to be buried. later, louis is greeted(not so politely) by church. he's returned, appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in. maybe he was buried alive. maybe not. nothing more i can say without ruining the story.of all the king adaptions i've seen this would be the most terrifying. the characters are real and the situations are normal. mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film, due in part to the plot development. the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever. then, of course, we have the conclusion. easy to determine what's going to happen, but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments.overall, this is a good film and an excellent adaption. if you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then "pet sematary" is just what you're looking for. non horror fans will want to avoid this.

so often with stephen king adaptations, you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books. this really captures the heart of the book. maybe because they don't use large chunks of text straight from the book, but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story. a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage. dale midkiff and denise "tasha yar" crosby really act like his parents. there's a scene where louis is cuddling gage, and they are very natural together. fred gwynne is wonderful. he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody, and is wise and warm just like jud should be. (8 out of 10)

ok, first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was 9 years old. if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time, i´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-tv horror film with some well-made scenes. but when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts. this scared the hell out of me back then, especially those aforementioned zelda- scenes (and they still do). nowadays i´m kind of hooked to this film. i have to see this maybe once in a month, and on every new year´s eve i watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends. it´s like an appetizer for a good party! i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense. midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like, but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which "the creeds" underact. what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary, and i don´t mean the zombie stuff here. the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind. honestly, how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-tv one, but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there? alright i busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago, but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection. but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary! i really would love to know...and i don´t mean night of the living dead here...this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff.

*****spoilers herein*****what really scares you? killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?maybe. but those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child. "pet sematary" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.i've read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. i disagree. the acting is actually first rate for a film like this. maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. but the film's events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. this is the true horror of "pet sematary": it isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does. despite warning, or even past history.the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect. and the results are horrifying. in fact, when the film dives into slasher territory near the end, it's almost a letdown, although i believe it's perfectly logical how it got there.i am a true horror fan, and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. if you don't think so, see it again after you have children.

minor spoilerunderrated little stephen king shocker. it's not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination--even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better, there'd still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with. the old micmac burial ground, rachel's terminally ill sister, and the jacob-marley-an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent, and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed. but few horror movies really are perfect, and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock. `pet sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda. it's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's gratuitous--and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way `safer' horror movies never can. add to that one of fred gwynne's best performances and mary lambert's witty direction, and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie--even with the hokey ending. highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.

"pet sematary" succeeds on two major situations. first, it's a scary horror movie. those that just aren't produced in these days. second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. so if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan. probably, the best adaptation to any of king's novels. the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel, but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete horror/drama accomplishment. stephen king's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time. the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members. then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title "pet sematary" does not offers appiness!) a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere, now it turns very dark. the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and "pet sematary" proves it dramatically. the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. sadly enough, the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead. the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much, much worse. what will happened with the lives of our all american family? could pascow prevent this tragedy? what is it with the surreal nightmares? watch "pet sematary" to witness one of the most touching, emotional horror movies of recent times. you won't regret. the acting is very good although i didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father. he didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation. but that's just my opinion. denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble, tender mother. baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts. *shivers*. overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a feeling of desperation.something is for sure... i don't wanna be buried, in a pet sematary!!

making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is never a good idea. when people read the book, they automatically start making their own "mental movie" of who the characters look like, the places they exist in, how the situations progress. and everybody's mind's-eye opus is different, which is why when the 'real' movie finally comes out, you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up.all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is, and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see.there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king. when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (carrie, 'salem's lot, the dead zone), or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (kubrick's version of the shining; the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers). although it's not even close to being the perfect king adaptation, pet sematary has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book, that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. for that, we have music video-turned-film director mary lambert to thank, (she also directed siesta, not exactly a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list), working from a screenplay by the 'man-ster' himself, and probably one of his better ones.since the majority of you know the story, i won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. dr. louis creed (dale midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well, even if you haven't read the book, do the frickin' math. it is a king story, after all, so no mystery where this is headed. it's not so much the destination that counts here, but the spooky stops along the way. certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery, scream-inducing life here: rachel creed's (star trek's denise crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill, crippled sister; louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow (brad greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip into the "other" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. and that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse.good performances by all here, especially the late fred gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor, jud crandall, who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: "sometimes, dead is better."about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis's son, gage (miko hughes). knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this, lambert and crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, hughes at the time was just too damn cute to "sell" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie. this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up, though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged, (especially gwynne's death scene.)other than that, everything else is still about as good as it gets. carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i'm concerned; but sematary is right up there in the top five.still, will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story? not bloody likely...for now.

this is one of the creepiest, scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie ever! dr creed (louise) and his family moving in to new home with his wife (rachel), daughter (ellie) and little son (gage) everything seems normal until dr creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury,then he is haunted by the ghost know as victor takes him to the pet sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life.louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to ellie who worried about her cat that could be killed by lorry and then later on rachel tells louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister zelda who was really sick (as we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever!) the next day louis gets a call from jed saying there cat as been killed by lorry and jed take him to place where victor the ghost told him not to go! and bury the cat, his wife and kids have go to see their grandparents and louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see jed then jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too (as we seen other flashback).later on in the movie the family out having picnic, gage is playing with kite and gage say's i drop it", the wind blow the rod near the road where a lorry coming at fast past, gage is get closer to road, louis is rushing to get him, the most heartbreaking scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on floor or shivers will go down your back when you hear louis screams, soon he missing him so much, louis then buries gage in same place where is buried the cat. the scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life. this movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great! 10 out 10

i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out. and the "no fair" uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance.

"pet sematary" is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title. the story follows the creeds - an all american, middle-class family, who move into a house out in the country. the family consists of louis and rachel, and their two young children, ellie and their toddler son, gage. the house couldn't be better, and the family meets a strange but friendly old man, jud, who lives across the road. he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves. and just beyond there, lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power. when the family cat, church, is killed, louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough, soon after, church returns to life. but there's something evil about him now, he isn't the same cat he used to be. and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage, louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son... unfortunately, he gets more than he bargained for.having read stephen king's novel, i can say that the book is much better than the film. not to say the movie is bad, because it isn't - the book is just a little bit better. the real strength in this film lies in it's story, which is both bizarre but extremely original, something that king's stories are typically known for. the script is very well adapted from the story, and while it minorly differs in some aspects, it's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation. there are a few plot holes here and there, nothing major though. besides that, this movie is actually pretty scary, and it succeeds in it's intention to do so. there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film, and i'd have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel's sister zelda is the number one. honestly, that is one of the most disgusting, disturbing things i've ever seen in a horror film - it's not gory and bloody, it's just flat out sickening. one thing's for sure, that image won't leave your head anytime soon.the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there. this film is actually on the gory side, there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there, including the shocker of an ending. i really liked the way they ended the film, it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive, but it worked better that way with all things considered.overall, "pet sematary" is a good horror movie that i'd recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general. the story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too. one of the better stephen king adaptations i'd say. 7/10.

louis creed, a doctor from chicago, moves to a large house near a small town, since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine's. along with him, is his wife rachel and their two kids, ellie and gage,as well as ellie's cat, church. soon, they met their new neighbor,and old man named judd crandall.judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house(that is constantly a way used by big trucks) but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house. judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery, but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children, since she has traumas from her sister zelda's death.during the first week of the family in the new house, louis already has dead people to deal with: victor pascow, a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident, addresses his dying words to louis personally, even though the two men are strangers. on the night following pascow's death, louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow, who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not "go beyond, no matter how much you feel you need to." louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream, until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. anyway, he dismisses the dream. many strange things starts to happen and church, ellie's cat, dies while walking on the highway. louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church's death with ellie, but judd, sympathizing with him, jud takes louis to the pet cemetery, supposedly to bury church. but instead of stopping there, jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to "the real cemetery": an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac ('...indians...'). there louis buries the cat on jud's instruction, with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life. and that is where the real horror story begins...i personally find this movie very good. it's not the most horrifying of all, but it is one of the best horror movies i watched. the way gage dies, is almost impossible to not stay in your memory, specially being a toddler. it's cool to see stephen king's cameo as the minister of the funeral.of course, there are some script errors: how can a rich doctor with two small kids, goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? things like that doesn't make any sense, but i can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.a good thing i saw in this movie, is the necessity to talk about death with the children, no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist, and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything. because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie, confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again, all the nightmare began.

as this happens to be one of most favorite novels , i was very excited to see the move. i was not disappointed! yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on , but i think that the movie stuck true to the book, and was a really good movie. it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones. it is such a dark story , which i guess is why i like it .. and what is better than the dead coming to life.. and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too. if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book!! it is a well written screen play , the actors could have done a better job ( i only say this for rachel , and ellie .. she was so whinny ) i liked everyone else a lot.. and most important to me .. it stuck true with the novel.

in the trivia section for pet sematary, it mentions that george romero (director of two stephen king stories, creepshow and the dark half) was set to direct and then pulled out. one wonders what he would've brought to the film, as the director mary lambert, while not really a bad director, doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of king's novel, of which he wrote the screenplay. there are of course some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister zelda, likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film), and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. but something feels missing at times, some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably king-like atmosphere, which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he'll save that for his final novel...) as mentioned though, some of the casting is terrific, notably miko hughes as gage creed, the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie, to being a little monster (i say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). and there is also a juicy supporting role for fred gwynne of the munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. and applause goes to whomever did the make-up on andrew hubatsek. but there are some other flaws though in the other casting; dale midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicted, disturbed father figure creed, and his daughter ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all.in terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces, only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil, it does involve a cool ramones song), and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining. for the most part it's a very polished directing job, though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script. if thought out in logical terms (albeit in king terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. but it doesn't add up like it could, or should. still, it makes for a nifty little midnight movie.

pet semetary (1989) 9/10 the creed family have just moved into the small town of ludlow. the family consists of a father, louis, a mother, rachel, a brother gage, and a daughter, ellen. they are greeted with kindness by jud crandall. jud is 89, and could basically tell you about the entire history of ludlow.behind the creed's new house, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery (spelled pet sematary). when ellen wants to go up to see it, jud willfully takes the family on a trip. that is the start of hell for the creed family.when rachel and the kids are gone, ellen's cat church dies. jud feels that ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat, so he suggests louis follow him further up the path, past the pet cemetery.jud tells louis of this burial ground, once used by micmac indians. louis buries church, without jud's help. a couple of days later, church returns, alive, but from hell.this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me, aside from "the exorcist." the greatest performance would ever be zelda, rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or victor pascow, a ghost who tries to help the creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead.the music in this movie plays an extravagant part. it is at the same time sad and mysterious. it goes along with the movie wonderfully.9/10

i am a big fan of stephen king's work, and this film has made me an even greater fan of king. pet sematary is about the creed family. they have just moved into a new house, and they seem happy. but there is a pet cemetery behind their house. the creed's new neighbor jud (played by fred gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. that burial ground is pure evil. jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being (or any kind of pet) up in the burial ground, they would come back to life. the only problem, is that when they come back, they are not the same person, they're evil. soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary, everything starts to go to hell. i wont explain anymore because i don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film. the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good, but needed a little bit of work. the story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. this film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie, and frightening. one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. there is one character in this film that is truly freaky. that character is "zelda." this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. zelda is rachel creed's sister who passed away years before, but rachel is still haunted by her. the first time zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the living **** out of me. there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. pet sematary delivers great scares, some pretty good acting, first rate plot, and mesmerizing make-up. this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.

pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel. mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king's creepy story pretty well. most people may avoid this, but they should check it out.

one of the best (if not the best) stephen king's screenings. dark as dark can be, surprising non-hollywood ending, terrifying atmosphere, amazing book adaptation, outstanding cast, educational (don't play with afterlife), in short - everything an excellent horror should be...my favorite horror movie, straight 10+.

this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by dale midkiff,fred gwynne(who sadly died few years ago)and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects.director mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style,and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing,but genuinely unnerving.the depiction of the zombie child gage(miko hughes-later in "new nightmare")is equally noteworthy,as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky.as for the people,who think that this one isn't scary-watch it alone in the dark(eventually with your squeamish girlfriend)and i guarantee you that "pet sematary" will creep you out.some horror movies like this one or "the texas chain saw massacre" shouldn't be watched in group.recommended for horror fans!

europa (zentropa) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago. this film is truly unique, and a work of genius. the camerawork and the editing are brilliant, and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film, creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience.the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed. max von sydow provides his great voice as the narrator.a one of a kind movie! four stars (highest rating).

terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt, good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines, well acted and well cast, tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion

very entertaining, and a great cast as noted. i'd like to add that bruce dern did a fine job also, as is usually the case. worth renting if you can find it, which has proved difficult for me. also note that the amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name.

tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud. the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself.there are a few surprises. as cynical as we are today, i fully expected the 'good girl' to be crying over his grave, instead of his buddy's. especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend', when she first meets matt. and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr. allen's face, blinding him (interesting role by bruce dern). wrrrooonnnnggg!!! some of the other hollywood endings do happen, but the writing is so excellent, the acting so carefully wrought that you're blissfully unaware.and the music is out of this world. taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley. even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago, but at a club called, wonderfully, 'biloxi' with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks. i'll be watching it again, just to hear the music. good thing i have the factotum sound track, so i can listen to that in the car. watch both together, and you'll see how matt has matured....playing bar room characters in both. now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc, he probably has great opportunity to do his studies. great actor, just coming into his own. he shows finely nuanced performances ...the good and the bad in his characters. his 'young boy off the farm' is a great study, made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes. he makes love, convincingly as well. since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen-ager, i wonder how that it ...making love to an actress you kinda grew up with. adds conviction, i'll say that.

considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film. the acting for the most part is great, although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best. however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent.

what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be. this is the type of film that i've been looking for ages. particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking chicago, which i still keep thinking about. the back cover doesn't do this film justice, it's superb, and in my top-5 for sure.

illudere (to delude) comes from latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, i was able to finish the book it was a revelation! at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (i really started to love le carre after that novel). the main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of green's 'our man in havana' wrote by lecarre with 'the tailor of panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. the bbc has done a superb work with these series from lecarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste is bitter.

i have just watched the whole 6 episodes on dvd. the acting throughout is excellent - no question. there was not quite enough action for me i must say. no real suspense as such, just plenty of first class character development. nothing like tinker tailor in terms of "whodunnit". if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you. peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent.the film portrayed the life of a traitor. a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things. as a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man. pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). pym is fatally damaged by his father's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away. he has no real love or loyalty in him.heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series. very well done though.

having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go, one can do nothing but doff one's hat - a pure masterpiece, which compared to the other le carré minis about smiley, has quite different qualities.in the minis about smiley, it is alex guiness, as smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him, one can say.here it is ensemble and story that's important, as the lead actor, played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes, isn't charismatic at all. egan just plays a guy called magnus pym, who by lying, being devious and telling people what they like to hear, is very well liked by everyone, big and small. the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex, his czech handler.never have the machinery behind a spy, and/or traitor, been told better! after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy', as his czech handler calls him. and, by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path, once you've veered off it. he trundles on, even if he never get anything economic out of it, except promotion by his mi5 spy masters. everyone's happy, as long as the flow of faked information continues! magnus's father, played wonderfully by ray mcanally, is a no-good con-man, who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money. in later years it is his son who has to bail him out, again and again. but by the example set by his dad and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mom is sent off to an asylum, magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving, not telling the truth. at first he overdoes it a bit, but quickly learn to tell the right lies, and to be constant, not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad.his czech handler alex, expertly played by rüdiger weigang, creates, with the help of magnus, a network of non-existing informants, which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years, and years, just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned, liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 men.the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, little more cynic, and tired, pym, played by egan. but you buy the difference easily, as that is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to sorrow, or indifference.indeed well worth the money!

as a fan of author john le carre i've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them. i found this 1987 adaptation of le carre's masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking i would know what to expect. i was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries, a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama.peter egan gives a great performance as magnus pym, the perfect spy of the title. carrying on in the long tradition of le carre's strong main characters, pym is also quite possibly the best. egan plays pym (who in fact contains many shades of author le carre) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming "a perfect spy". egan plays pym to perfection as a man always on the run, if not from others then from himself. egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone.surronding egan is a fantastic supporting cast. ray mcanally gives one of his finest performances as pym's con man father rick who (as le carre has said) is based strongly on the author's own father. mcanally plays a man who comes in and out of pym's life and is one of the those responsible for pym becoming "a perfect spy". in fact if it wasn't for mcanally's performance a year after this in a very british coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career.the rest of the supporting is excellent as well. from caroline john as pym's mother to alan howard as his spy mentor to rüdiger weigang as the young pym's friend turned controller to jane booker as pym's wife the supporting cast is fantastic. special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger pym (jonathan haley, nicholas haley and benedict taylor) who establish the young man who would become the man played so well by peter egan.the production values of the miniseries are strong as well. as the miniseries adaptations of tinker, tailor, soldier, spy and smiley's people proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format. the locations are excellent from the english locations to the those scattered across eastern europe and the usa as are the sets by chris edwards. the cinematography of elmer cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries. yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script.screenwrtier arthur hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently. the novel was largely (at least in its early parts) autobiographical in that pym's early life echoed much of john le carre's life. the script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of magnus pym from young boy to "a perfect spy". never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage. if one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight, fist fight, or james bond style car chase this would be the proof. while the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it.though it might be overlong for some for those who don't have very short attention spans here is a must see. from the performances of peter egan and ray mcanally to fine production values and a fine literary script a perfect spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see. it is a fascinating trip down the history of the cold war yet it is more then that. it is also a trip down what john le carre has called "the secret path": the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive. as much a human drama as a spy thriller a perfect spy isn't to be missed.

this is my second time through for a perfect spy. i watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. i like it still. it's natural that it gets compared to the beeb's other big le carre' series, tinker tailor soldier spy. tinker tailor focuses on the "game" spies play; perfect spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person a spy is. there are a number of themes that these movies share, along with others in the genre.ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - which creates a multidimensional space of true vs. false, inside vs. outside, love vs. responsibility. in a way, these characters are happiest when they are being treated the most shabbily by those they love and respect - "backstabbed" in its various nuances.the theme of fathers and father-figures is also important. one of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is rick, the main character magnus' perhaps ersatz father. throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed. a rogue who always manages to climb back up the ladder when he's been toppled, who seems impervious to what others think of him, asks magnus each time they meet, "do you love your old man?" and never, "do you love me?" maybe it says this somewhere else, but a perfect spy is a love story.another theme is that of malignancy. the nature of the business is to turn others - turn them against their government, against their friends and associates, turn them against their values and beliefs. in each of the le carre' movies i have seen, the spy who came in from the cold, looking glass war, tinker tailor soldier spy, smiley's people, and a perfect spy, turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy. finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot, or perhaps two shots bookending the story. violence, torture, cruelty are always just beneath the surface. we see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells but in the the objects le carre''s characters cling to as they are ineluctably sucked down into the morass.if you haven't seen the films above, and you enjoy a perfect spy, you are in for a treat. i'd also recommend the sandbagger series (yorkshire tv), the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity. the ipcress file and burial in berlin are nice, though light weight. for political intrigue try a very british coup, house of cards and yes, minister/yes, prime minister. if only a brit would set his hand to making the three kingdoms - there would be a film with intrigue and complexity.

this is an extremely long movie, which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies.if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart-wrenching, because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak. if you can love a monster you'll cry for magnus pym, the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country, his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people.there isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story, not one loyal, 'moral' personality to sympathise with. but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable.i really enjoyed it in the end. well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character.

it's been a long time since i saw this mini-series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time. most of the components of 'a perfect spy', the adaptation of lecarré's finest novel, in my opinion, are top-drawer. outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay, the latter written by arthur hopcraft who was also, i believe, the screenwriter for 'tinker tailor soldier spy' with alec guinness a few years before.the actors are mostly very good, some superb, like alan howard's jack brotherhood and ray mcanally's ricky pym. peter egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle. the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done. so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter egan was at the time of filming. the only jolt comes after the character of magnus pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named benedict taylor to those of a noticeably too-old peter egan, just fresh out of oxford. but this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole.egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be "upset" emotionally, ie cry. none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments, aside from the wonderful frances tomelty who plays peggy wentworth for all she's worth and steals the episode with ease.jane booker is annoying as mary pym. she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife, which mary pym is. rüdiger weigang is splendid as axel, amusing, ironic and brilliant. i also enjoyed sarah badel's camp turn as the baroness.the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes. when the yanks have come abroad to confab with bo brammell (head of mi6) the american contingent are portrayed as empty-headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with american jargon and psycho babble, much to the bemused scorn of the english. the humor and sadness are subtly blended. lecarré has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy, yet wistful, atmosphere of the original.not a perfect production (what is?) and yet the best of the lecarré adaptations to reach film or television to date. highly recommended to all spy-thriller lovers and especially lecarré fans. dvd available from acorn.

this is without doubt my favourite le carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for. i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but i believe this misses the point. all le carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception. it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody. pym upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching. peter egan is in his finest role and the late lamented ray mcanally is unbelievably good. even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour, tim healy and jack ellis are spot on. this cast is a theatre impresario's dream. the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason. all my sympathies lie with magnus pym and his sole (non sexual) love for poppy (rüdiger weigang-as wonderful as always. his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals. outstanding! rent it, buy it. love it.

without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. performances by peter egan (magnus pym, the perfect spy), rudiger weigang (axel, real name alexander hampel, magnus' czech intelligence controller), ray mcanally (magnus' con-man father) and alan howard (jack brotherhood, magnus' mentor, believer and british controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award. even the small parts, such as major membury, are performed to perfection. it says a lot for the power of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u.s. intelligence. i have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the movie almost as many times, and continue to be mesmerized by both. if i had one book to take on a desert island, a perfect spy would be the choice above all others.

i haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. when asked about my favorite films, this is the one that i seem to always mention first. there are certain films (works of art like this film, "dark city", and "breaking the waves") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend... this film "shook" me when i first saw it. it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.

this movie probably had a $750 budget, and still managed to surpass titanic. i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car, and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief! it has to be tied with 'the assult of the killer bimbos'. things to look for are: 1. the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2. the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3. the flinstone-like screech out driving 4. the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed (don't worry, i'm not ruining any surprises, for it's soooo predictable) 5. the guy who finds it necessary to howl. 6. the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen. 7. the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall. 9. last, but not least, the wonderful special effects--especially the stab in the boob that made a... heaven help me... popping noise.enjoy!

this movie is great. if you enjoy watching b-class movies, that is. this is a classic college 80's slasher movie, in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack. a horrible film, but worth renting to make fun of, or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives. kinda funny, if you ask me.

a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film. also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original. i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies. a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film. also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original. i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies. a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film. also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original. i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.

just kidding about the weight loss thing; well, you might lose weight you never know. anyway, what can i say, i love this film. it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies. jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them. the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery, and horror they perceive. jake's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with. watch it with friends; watch it with loved ones; build a fort - wine optional.

i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster. i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family.i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions.the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults, has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create.i found the film to be delightful!

jake's closet has the emotional power of kramer vs. kramer combined with the imagination of pan's labyrinth. even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan's labyrinth. but this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today. jake's closet is about a boy, an only child, practically alone on summer vacation, dealing with his family falling apart. it's a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense, a horror movie for the thinking person. if you're looking for a slasher movie, this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting, this is the movie for you. at the screening i saw, i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed. i highly recommend catching this film.

answer: despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth.the acting in this independent film actually is quite good, despite the less-than-wonderful script. it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten, clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable. young anthony de marco, as jake, puts in a particularly good performance.fortunately, the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog. try it, especially if you're not a monster fan. this is not a horror flick. even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous, and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film, "jake's closet" is suitable for mature adults.the whole, this time, is much better than the sum of its parts.

i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing, acting and cinematography of jake's closet. the emotions were very real and intense showing, through a child's eyes, the harsh impact of divorce.a definite see!i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing, acting and cinematography of jake's closet. the emotions were very real and intense showing, through a child's eyes, the harsh impact of divorce.a definite see!

i saw this at "dances with films", and it was awesome. i really felt for jake. talk about adding insult to injury! not only are your parents getting divorced, but there's a monster after you. it was both heartfelt and scary -- there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright. it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film, except that the story was actually good.and that's what separated "jake's closet" from the usual indy film pabulum -- an excellent script with compelling characters. also, by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama, the movie gets the best out of both genres, and avoids the clichés of both.if it's not coming out in theaters, definitely get the dvd.

anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. is jake (a mesmerizing anthony demarco) simply "transferring" the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? or could the creature be real? writer/director shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia.brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry, but loving parents. however it is the creepy minor characters, mrs. bender(barbara gruen), an unhinged babysitter and sam stone (ben bode), a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind. jake's closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.

every child experiences trauma growing up and every child's active imagination has gotten the best of them, but for jake (anthony de marco  of the forthcoming clint eastwood film changeling - who resembles henry thomas circa 1982) the combination may prove deadly. a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents peter (sean bridgers, late of "deadwood") and jules (brooke bloom, "cbs: miami") suddenly decide to divorce, leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant  a zombie in his closet.jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon (matthew josten) who provides him with a print out off the internet of faq re: zombies. jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it's too late.indie newcomer shelli ryan  who wrote and directed  blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former (smartly) outweighs the latter, with a decent story buoyed by fine acting(de marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not 'acting' - all his nuances are very evident of the awkward, shy, introverted child that many can relate too (i certainly can). bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality  it doesn't help when dillon's mother ruth (monette magrath, who resembles laura dern) is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between jake and his dad. magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i won't go into detail but shows why she is the way she is (and more importantly how she has also affected her own child).the fillmmaker's subjective camera is also well employed (many angles shown form jake's pov at waist-level or somewhat skewed; i.e. the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard), and the editing is relatively flawless. ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears, anger and stress onto their children. here the film is very successful in getting its theme across.however the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a. romero's zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan (jake's mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead unspools, causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home). the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy-handed but again, the child's fear of a thing under his bed is universal.

as much as the movie was good, i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already. all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark. maybe i wrong and in that case i'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me.

"kolchak: the night stalker" is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a pushy, sarcastic, forty-something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) forces. based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character, this series died a quick death in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today. but will the average modern-day viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? that's actually a tough question to answer fairly. detractors of this series tend to argue that it's formulaic and hopelessly dated. on the other hand, fans argue that it's cleverly written, well-acted, and sometimes genuinely spooky. and me? i've got a foot in both camps. i thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of kolchak on dvd recently, though i can plainly see that the series has major flaws.i'll address the question of kolchak being "formula" fiction first. now, i think we can all agree that most tv shows have formulas - just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern, for example. repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; in fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy, and actively seek out, repetitive entertainment. however, the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid - it's too repetitive even by the most generous standards.in almost every episode, kolchak investigates a murder, and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster. he tries to publish a story about said monster, but his editor vincenzo blocks him, always on the grounds that kolchak doesn't have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work. and, alas, kolchak is also obstructed by the police. so, in the end, kolchak does some independent research on the monster, figures out how to kill it... and then kills it. without ceremony, or reward, or writing a big story about it.you can see where this ever-so-strict formula might get tiresome, right? i'm particularly mystified by vincenzo - if kolchak's always raving about monsters, and vincenzo never believes it... well, then, why doesn't vincenzo fire kolchak, or have him committed? that's what any normal boss would do. but the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical antagonists. as a result, many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable - though they are also quite funny.the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula, however, usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist. these select episodes are good enough that i think they're largely immune to typical criticisms of the series. some of my favorites include: horror in the heights - an episode that's noteworthy for being grimy, inventive and socially aware. kolchak's dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. though it adheres closely to the kolchak formula, the script (written by hammer studios veteran jimmy sangster) is remarkably literate, and it delves deeply into the monster's backstory.the devil's platform - a possible inspiration for the "omen" films, this episode stands out to me because the villain - a very young tom skerritt - tempts kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies (and, in so doing, reveals a lot about the reporter's character.) firefall - this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans, but i enjoyed it because it's got a great red herring and a really creepy, almost unstoppable-seeming monster.though i've singled out these three episodes for praise, i'd say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least. for my money, there are only two complete turkeys in the 20-episode run: primal scream, which is about monkey-men running rampant in chicago, and the sentry, which features the dumbest-looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment (and this assessment is coming from a lifelong doctor who and godzilla fan!) on balance, then, this is a good series. a little repetitive, a little cheesy perhaps, but it has elements of greatness. even during the weaker episodes, darren mcgavin's wonderful performance as the caustic, world-weary, endlessly funny kolchak truly shines. he carries the series effortlessly, in a way that, for example, sarah michelle gellar never managed on "buffy." mcgavin was one great character actor, and this series is worth watching for him alone.

since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed. this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's tv series "x-files"- but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach. but don't get me wrong, some of these episodes have full on horror themes, many in which have some pretty greuesome plots (left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television).some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting, but that is the charm and attraction to this series. whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi/horror themes, this series brought all that together. each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so (1 hour with commercials) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more. a great classic show that is underrated in my book!

piece of subtle art. maybe a masterpiece. doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. the life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.leopold kessle is another joseph k. images of trial and same ambiguous woman. and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.methaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution. war, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. hypocrisy is a mask. love- a convention. the sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.

if mulder was looking for his real father here he is darren mcgavin, the first x files, pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker, the x files. both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren mcgavin, as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero,s solving cases. paying homage to the man i think so, well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker.

i barely remember this show, a little ,but i remembered it was great! my eldest brother, reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the d.v.d set coming out. the network, again screwed up in pulling this from the air, so that they could put what else in it's place? it should have gone at least 3 seasons. why not, right? i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the 'gods' of the entertainment world. but they mis-guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time. let it be said that, they have a lot more flops than 'hits'. this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line-up. anyhow, i am getting this for my collection.

as a forty-something urban explorer/photography and longtime fan of the original kolchak: night stalker series since my early childhood, one aspect that hasn't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration carl's character undertook during the series. he always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment, sewer or tunnel after another. armed with only his trusty penlight (okay, so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel) and his camera, he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier.like many here, i recently purchased the dvd box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent tv episodes, and have been slowly revisiting all the shows. and although i remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired, its been over 30 years passed...so many of them seem new all over again. campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining. they just don't make stuff like this these days. now its all regurgitated spin-offs with predictable characters and plots.thankfully, my 16-yr-old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she enjoys the genre). it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come.

kolchak is sheer entertainment. great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down. darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him. simon oakland, jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having. some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes - erik estrada in legacy of terror, phil silvers in horror in the heights, antonio fargas in the zombie. it's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files. darren - rip. simon - rip. ruth - rip.

there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written, seminal tv show (the "godfather" to x-files and buffy, etc.); as a monster show (it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid!), or as a well-written/acted gumshoe/film-noir. it works on both levels. the scariness may have been diluted over the years (it was made in the mid-70s), but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show (via dvd) that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons. the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak, an eccentric, tenacious, rumpled newsman/monster-hunter who, in pursuit of a story, always finds a supernatural angle; much to the pain of kolchak's over-stressed, put-upon boss tony vincenzo(played with tremendous world-weariness by the also late, great simon oakland; you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers!). the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty (much like star trek's spock and mccoy, only more acidic!). over the course of two pilot tv movies and a one-season series, kolchack fought vampires, robots, werewolves, witches, zombies, government conspiracies, aliens, and ancient legends (sounds like the entire 9 yr. run of the x-files! in one season!). and kolchak did it first! and as for composer gil melle's cool, partly-whistled main title music... well, x-files creator chris carter calls mike snow's (very similar) x-files main title theme an 'homage.' both themes work well; leave it at that. and unlike many modern horror/sci-fi shows, most of kolchak's monsters are shown in shadow, and in quick cuts(effectively, and sometimes thankfully; as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny; but some still do). modern horror shows take note: less is more! one of the few flaws of the show (and it's a small one) is the over-use of sunny, california locales passing for windy city chicago. night gallery had the same issue; unavoidable for a modest-budget, l.a. based show. and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are (now) viewed as clichés (the effeminate reporter, ron updike, always used for comic relief; sweet, old lady/advice columnist emily). but, they all do have their moments to shine (unlike many supporting tv characters since, cliché or not!). kolchak is a timeless show, that serves as a template for many that followed. and carl kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre tv show (agent mulder's real dad). and as a footnote, i tried watching a few episodes of the new, "re-imagining" of the show. it's an x-files clone (a copy of a copy?). and a bad one, at that. carl kolchak is now a model-pretty, angsty 30-something (played dismally by a boring stuart townsend). and giving him a scully-type partner is also a lame idea; it undermines kolchak as a lone, don quixote crusader! and kolchak and vincenzo getting along? where's the tension? the interplay? that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this regurgitated bit o' crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake: take a beloved cult series, scrape off everything unique about it, drain it of all character and color (but keep the name! need that cult cred!), and voilà! instant re-hash! it gets an 'f' in 're-imaginings 101'! this new version deserved the axe! stick with the short-lived, but classic original. it truly gets better with age.

a couple of years back i had purchased (and enjoyed) the mgm double-feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies, the night stalker (1971) and the night strangler (1972). when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out, i had intended to buy it immediately – but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd-18s kept me from adding it to my collection; recently, i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak 3-discer as well.having watched it now, i can safely say that i didn’t regret acquiring this beloved (if short-lived) crime/horror series one bit: it may follow a standardized formula – dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak, marvelously played by darren mcgavin, gets into everybody’s hair with his attitude (flustered editor simon oakland, long-suffering colleagues, assorted authoritarian figures, a plethora of monsters and villains), faces up to the inevitable (and usually supernatural) threat alone but, finally, is pressured into keeping his story under wraps – but a winning one (further boosted by an impressive line-up of guest stars and notable behind-the-scenes credits), making the show a great deal of fun.that said, quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make-up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired (for instance, the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment) – not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50-minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes (in the case of the werewolf, again, he’s never seen biting anyone but, somewhat foolishly, is made to merely throw people around)! while the hero’s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots, there’s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, revolving around mcgavin’s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage) – to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere (the setting, for the most part, is chicago) and suspense. to make the ride even more pleasant, there’s a bouncy score by gil melle' and jerry fielding.for the record, the monsters encountered (but not always defeated) by kolchak throughout the series are: a revived jack the ripper, a variety of cults (voodoo, native american, aztec), aliens, vampire, werewolf (going round its over-familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise-liner!), doppelganger, satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcyclist, succubus, a knight’s armor taking a murderous life of its own (the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast – featuring john dehner as a morose police captain, hans conried and robert emhardt), helen of troy(!) and crocodile. some of the actors (other than those playing kolchak’s co-workers) return in the same roles – keenan wynn and ramon bieri (both as officers of the law), john fiedler (as a shrewd morgue attendant) and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero. if i were pressed to choose the finest (or most entertaining) episodes, i’d lean towards horror in the heights (co-starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer) and the afore-mentioned the knightly murders – while, as the weakest, i’d go for the werewolf (due to reasons i’ve already explained) and chopper (based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale!).unfortunately, the set contains no extras: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak: the night stalker, as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing, or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci-fi series popular today. in fact, kolchak himself – in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise – returned in a 2005 revival; this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet…but, for various reasons, i’m not sure i’d want to check it out so soon after the 1974-5 classic!

"kolchak" was a tv series that really didn't fit into any category. part horror, part comedy, some social awareness thrown in, and what we have is something that i think people weren't ready for. it's a shame really, as i've started to watch these shows on the chiller network, (i never saw the originals), i realized how different and interesting it really was. starring darren mcgavin as kolchak a reporter for the international news service, and simon oakland as his always angry boss, tony vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of a chicago news reporter who more often than not, became a part of the story himself, as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night. the underlying charm of macgavin really sets the show apart. a somewhat goofy guy, who always wears the same suit, you cannot help but love him. his jokes are great, and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor, oakland, are downright hilarious. the stories are for the most part pretty good, and the acting is very good. the 70's were not a *great* period for special effects, and the show suffers for it, but if you suspend disbelief, what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it's time.

i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter. kolchak was hard-bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big-city reporting, and his gritty determination and wise-ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable. my personal fave was "the spanish moss murders" due to it's totally original storyline. a poor,troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country, takes part in a sleep research experiment, for the purpose of dream analysis. something goes inexplicably wrong, and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state, and brutally suffocates them to death. kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth, much to the chagrin of police captain joe "mad dog" siska(wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn)and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder, severn darden, to droll, understated perfection. the wickedly funny, harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system, and is a series highlight. kolchak never got any better. timeless.

i'd love to give kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went from scary/suspenseful to silly. abc's fault. they moved the show to friday nights at 8:00 p.m., then known as the "family hour". never should have been on fridays in the first place. i was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes! it was first up against police woman on nbc. abc had huge problems with friday nights. bad season for them overall until barney miller, baretta, and swat debuted in january of '75. kolchak should have been a hit. darren mcgavin begged to get out of his contract to end the show. too bad the writing wasn't up to richard matheson's in the original tv movies. still, mcgavin made kolchak his own, as actors can do. jackie gleason as ralph kramden and caroll o'connor as archie bunker come to mind. that ins set with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and ancient today, yet that was part of the appeal. they were very lucky to have simon oakland reprise "vincenzo" from the tv films.

it's a genuine shame that this spin-off tv series inspired by the superior made-for-tv pictures "the night stalker" and "the night strangler" only lasted a single season and twenty episodes, because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor (carl kolchak's spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear), clever writing, nifty supernatural menaces (gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in "the spanish moss murders," "the sentry," and "horror in the heights," plus you can't go wrong with such tried'n'true fright favorites as zombies, vampires, werewolves, and witches), colorful characters, lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars (legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in "the energy eater" while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn, john fiedler, john dehner, severn darden, and william daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of genuine suspense (the sewer-set climax of "the spanish moss murders" in particular was truly harrowing), and, best of all, the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash, aggressive, and excitable, but basically decent, brave, and honest small-time chicago, illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchak.kolchak was the quintessential 70's everyman protagonist, a wily and quick-witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble. moreover, the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman; he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat, yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes. kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters: simon oakland was perfect as carl's chronically ill-tempered boss tony vincenzo, jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil, ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles, and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein (who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes). granted, the show did suffer from lackluster make-up and special effects (the titular lycanthrope in "the werewolf" unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier!) and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters (the headless motorcyclist in "chopper," cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in "the youth killer'), but even the second-rate shows are redeemed by the program's trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavin's boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence.

i loved kolchak: the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13, 1974. i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle (hey, where's the soundtrack guys?) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple, important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level. when darren mcgavin's carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. it's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force. he's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works. sometimes, he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are. in one episode, he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it, he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly, he must go back and defend himself. he's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him. he's a regular guy, doing a job, trying to make a buck, not a monster-hunter. he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural, which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do. if his plan to defeat the creature didn't work, you will often see him running for his life to get away from it, which is of course what i would do in the situation. that's why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid. kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him. you were scared for him and for the other characters too. the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit, scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters. darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a "monster of the week" show and he decided not to continue. i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but, as an adult, i can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long. i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling, determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the ins, known as carl kolchak. i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show. it's not the monsters, darkly-lit sets, creepy music or goofy guest stars, although they are all vital ingredients. the secret to it's success is right there in the title - "kolchak: the night stalker". without mcgavin's lovable, bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't a night stalker.

weak scripts at times? yep! cheesy special effects at times? yep! deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? yep! more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin? yep! i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but found so much of the dracula/frankenstein/mummy/horror stuff as just so much crap. it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the "dark side" of entertainment. the duke had rooster cogburn, eastwood had dirty harry, garner had maverick and rockford, selleck had magnum, and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak. mixed in with all those weak scripts, cheesy special effects, that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars, there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak. he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger, was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth, and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. additionally, unlike 98% of us, kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his demise, the end of his journalistic career, or jail time. for all his faults, including no taste in clothes, carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang (which was an old used car at the time) on his way to save the day for humanity. as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin. now that he's passed on and his show is on dvd, i hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again!

when originally screened in america in 1972, 'the night stalker' became the highest rated made-for-t.v. movie in history. based on jeff rice's unpublished novel, it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak ( the late darren mcgavin ) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day las vegas. when it arrived on british television four years later, it did not quite have the same impact, but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning, as indeed was i. we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen. i did not know of the existence of 'the night strangler' until it turned up nearly a decade later. i.t.v., who screened the 'kolchak' movies, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt 'barnaby jones' starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw, and anyway, viewers might confuse 'kolchak' with 'kojak'! for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine. i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels.then something wonderful happened. in 1990, b.b.c.-2 put out the show as part of a late-night friday series devoted to the supernatural called 'mystery train', hosted by richard o'brian. 'kolchak' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'the brain eaters' and 'earth vs.the spider'. the opening titles were trimmed, removing kolchak's whistling, and the closing credits...well, there were none.the first episode screened was 'werewolf'. i cannot say i was overly impressed, but stuck with it, and am i glad that i did!i really wish i'd seen it in 1974. my twelve year old self would have adored it. creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder it fired chris carter's imagination. the show's biggest asset was, of course, mcgavin. unlike the recent kolchak, the original was an everyman figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. he was to the supernatural what 'columbo' was to crime. the late simon oakland was great too as kolchak's bad-tempered boss tony vincenzo. the scripts overflowed with wonderful, dry wit. i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror. when the twenty episodes ended, i felt bereft.'the x-files' came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent. i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back. i am glad that the show was never revived though. without oakland it would not have been the same.i have the rice books now and have read them several times. i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first ( in his book 'danse macabre' ) as it is as good as anything he has written. alright, so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art, but so what? the new 'kolchak' totally missed the point of the original. what you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do...best episode - 'horror in the heights' worst episode - 'the sentry'

one of my favorite shows back in the '70s. as i recall it went to air on friday (or possibly saturday)night on the nine network (?) here in australia. darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together.each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. to their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible.i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which/who 'came back' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital. the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames. oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best.definitely deserves a place in tv's "hall of fame". to quote tony vincenzo .... 'kolchack you are on it '... or, in the case of the hall of fame,'in it' !

a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up truck."mirage" is obviously inspired by spielberg's "duel" and craven's "the hills have eyes".still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.the film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck.there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences.the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak,but the film is fast-paced and shocking.b.g.steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.overall,if you like low-budget horror films give this one a look.8 out of 10.

i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it). i don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (todd schaefer, kenny johnson and kevin mcparland). i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck. it's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. but where do i find it? how can i download it?

well, this was one of those films i caught on the off-chance, and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time... if, like myself, you enjoy many 80's horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm (i.e. not just another glut of generic sequels) then i think you may enjoy this. when the bad guy eventually turns up in person, he was definitely not what i expected to see! all in all, i wouldn't go out of your way for this one, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, i guess. i'd give it 6.5 out of 10.

this movie, which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less, moving vehicle, has quite the quirky little personality to boot. the cast of seven (although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert (an odd but effective choice of setting), who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. it predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("the trip", "joy ride", "jeepers creepers") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. the killer himself is quite creepy, and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire, as scanty and stonewashed as it may be). director bill crain does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast tries their absolute best. there's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough t&a from a couple of the girls to please t&a fans. overall, this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video. highly recommended.

mirage (1990) is a very rare horror/chiller from 1990, released here in the uk on the "new world video" label.it's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck!!! this film has some creepy scenes, and some gore here and there, but i have to say that the acting was so lame, even by low budget standards! but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it, and i never fell asleep or turned it off, which is always a good sign! i nearly gave this movie 6/10, but seeing as it built up steam along the way, had some good moments of gore and suspense, had some good nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too! i'll give it 7/10.

bill crain's rarer than rare 'slasher' movie certainly doesn't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts. the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons; - a sin that's virtually unacceptable in most post-halloween genre pieces. but there's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you've grown to expect. just as wally koz's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family, mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director. looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature. but despite fairly good distribution across the globe, the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market. nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert, which as i'm sure you'll agree is hardly the most exciting location. with that said though, i must admit that there's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly. four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way. chris (jennifer mcallister) and her boyfriend greg (kenny johnson) meet up with amusing new age hippies trip (kevin mcparland) and mary (nicole anton) at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune-like wilderness. greg's older brother kyle (todd schaefer) and his buxom girlfriend bambi (laura albert) soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave. kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn't seem too keen to forget. sound like a motive for a massacre? well what did you expect? before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve. will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel? i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature. i don't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others. mirage certainly doesn't appear on his official filmography, so your guess is as good as mine. judging by the credible work behind the camera, i'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience. the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain, and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it's necessary. r. christopher biggs' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome, and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent 18 rating. a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre. one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade, while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck! there's also some black humor that's surely unintentional. we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters. but when he's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted's bogus journey, i didn't quite know what to expect. thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically.there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast. the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b.g. steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse. the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn't come at the cost of thespian potential. the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation, which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs. watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film-making at it's freakiest.mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite. when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck, you have to say that they did a damn good job. the flaws are numerous, but never detract credibility from the net result. unfortunately you've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy. if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store, then make sure you pick it up. recommended.

i couldn't agree more with the other comment, it's like falling down. peter weller is ok and william hurt great as always, except in lost in space. this is a good movie. with pretty good performances. very recommendable. if you like falling down you're going to enjoy this one. 8 of 10

the story has been told before. a deadly disease is spreading around... but the extra in this film is peter weller, his interpretation of muller on the run is real. he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child. this person could be working next to you.

man oh man... i've been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term, there's a long list!) to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so. and "news" are: marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!for any von trier's "follower": both rigets, element of crime, dogville, dancer in the dark, the five obstructions, etc... europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms. everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic! you really get the feeling of being inside this "imaginary" nightmarish time warp. taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel, bergman, till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant-guard von trier leads the art-film scene as the "well intended totalitarian" movie maker of nowadays. his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues, without being irrational, hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world.as utopian as it seems, i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it could be the start of a new era: "the age of emotional control over our fears". this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over.bravo!

william hurt may not be an american matinee idol anymore, but he still has pretty good taste in b-movie projects. here, he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean-ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run --played by former pretty-boy weller-- who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. current pretty-boy hardy kruger jr --possibly more handsome than his dad-- is featured as weller's arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving. natasha mcelhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable & high-cheekboned love interest for hero hurt. michael brandon pops up to play a slimy take-no-prisoners type whose comeuppance you can't wait for. the coca-cola company wins the product placement award for 2000 as the soft drink is featured throughout the production, shot lovingly on location in a wintery picture-postcard hungary.

the contaminated man is a good film that has a good cast which includes william hurt, natascha mcelhone, peter weller, katja woywood, michael brandon, nikolett barabas, hendrick haese, désirée nosbusch, arthur brauss, and christopher cazenove.the acting by all of these actors is very good. hurt and weller are really excellent in this film. i thought that they performed good. the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. the movie is filmed very good. the music is good. the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. this is a very good and thrilling film. if you like william hurt, natascha mcelhone, peter weller, katja woywood, michael brandon, nikolett barabas, hendrick haese, désirée nosbusch, arthur brauss, christopher cazenove, the rest of the cast in the film, actio, thrillers, dramas, and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today!

now i had the pleasure of first viewing contaminated man when it premiered on tv back in december of 2000.an infectious disease expert (william hurt) looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them. now some years later he is now in russia or someplace. i'm not sure where exactly, all i know is it takes place somewhere in that area. anyway, because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory, they are forced to lay off most of their workers. one of them, a disgruntled security guard named joseph muller (played peter weller, best known for his role as the indestructible robocop) goes in there and demands that they give him his job back. he needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support. so he goes in there, a fight breaks out, and some things get knocked over, dangerous things. it's soon discovered that muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen. in fact it's so deadly, one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds. soon word gets out and the disease expert (hurt) is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an american reporter. now muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire russian population.now as i said before this film is a lot like falling down. we have a disturbed person (weller here, michael douglas in falling down) who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process. next we have a hero-type person (hurt here, robert duvall in falling down) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist.contaminated man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances.8/10

it was extremely low budget(it some scenes it looks like they recorded with a home video recorder). however it does have a good plot line, and its easy to follow. 8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward, with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with. the doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car. but within the first 20 minutes of the movie amanda kills him and buries him in her backyard. then she see's her neighbor richard sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him. she acts innocent but after another neighbor buzz finds out that amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill richards wife laurie (this is after amanda and him get it on in the hot tub). then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for. and you'll have to rent the movie to find out if amanda dies or not. overall good movie, reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling for the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you have him part.

the premise is simple. this movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport, then things take a 180 degree turn...i for one, really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater. and it is my humble opinion that wes craven, based on his previous meta-horror films (sceam) does too...following this logic, it's not surprising to find that craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love'-story, only to have an awesome cillian murphy wreck that whole sugar-coated dreamworld... the scope of his character jackson ripner (jack the ripper, get it? lame, right?) in this film is impressive, he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko, which is a plus in my book. as he proceeds to freak out his victim (jennifer garner lookalike rachel mcadams, who i found pretty annoying by the way), you can't help but sympathize with the guy...this is wes craven, embodied in jackson ripner, through cillian murphy, bashing all brainless chick flicks...mr. craven, i salute you.best quote:jackson ripner (after beating the snot out of rachel mcadams in the airplane toilet): "thanks for the quickie!!!"

rachel mcadams. cillian murphy. wes craven. the dream team. this is one of the best thrillers of 2005. a great plot. a great twist. a great eye candy. this is one of wes craven's greatest movies apart from "scream" and "a nightmare on elm street". this could be the best. the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple. lisa reisert (mcadams) a struggling hotel manager, boards a late red eye back to la. little does she know that she has been followed by jackson ripner aka jack the ripper (murphy). they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secreteary of homeland security who is staying in lisa's hotel. and what does this have to with lisa. well, she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him, if she doesn't ripner will murder her father (brian cox). the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it. overall, definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. definitely worth the see.3 1/2 out of 4 stars

wes craven has been created a most successful killer-thriller movies of all time. after watching he's movies, you will find your new fears. people don't know, which wes craven's thriller movie is the best, because they all different.in this movie, lisa is terrorize by fellow-traveler. he coercible her to kill and if she don't do this, jack will kill her father. lisa is in the huge mess, because whatever she choose, she will kill.acting was unreal. rachel mcadams and cillian murphy acted unbelievable good. the emotions was in right choose. idea and script of this movie is great too...sometimes it reminds a "scream", but he definitely better, than both "screams" sequels together.and what can i say - this is the best killer-thriller movie in 21's century yet...

like most people, i've seen jason priestley on tv and i think he's great. but i didn't know he had a sister! justine priestley is simply "mah"velous as the scorned other woman. good music, intrigue, and a death scene involving amanda's revenge on an abusive dr. that will stay with you for weeks. i'll leave it at that. kudos.

great little thriller. i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time. mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed. o such foolishness here. yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals. such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled. we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel clerk was. we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose. the flight atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead. the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight. the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too. the only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane. that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot. from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge. even when jackson shows his true colors she doesn't panic. she thinks what she can do to stall time. any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots. but not this one. it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast. thankfuly none of them were used. the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do, which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything, or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her. was craven should do more of these types of movies. also one last comment. brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was. i had to come over here to see that he is lisa's father. he is completely unrecognizable.

i was bored one night and red eye was on and thought why not.red eye is one of the best movies in a long time.i mean i just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant.the story is new and different.the movie also has two great leads in the movie with rachel mcadams as lisa reisert and cillian murphy as jackson rippner.the acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie.the music is just excellent, it give you chills and can also make you feel relax.i just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring.red eye is just phenomenal. nothing more and nothing less.it's a excellent thriller.overall, i enjoy red eye so much that i can watch it over and over again.if you like red eye, then i recommend elektra and cry wolf.i give red eye 9 out of 10.great movie

cillian murphy and rachel mcadams star in this action/thriller written and directed by the master of suspense, wes craven, himself. the whole movie starts with some trouble at the lux atlantic, a hotel in miami. the problem is all fixed by lisa reisert, the manager of the hotel. then she goes to the airport, and that's where all of the trouble begins. she meets jackson rippner, who doesn't like to be called jack because of the name jack the ripper, if you know you him and i mean. then they board the plane, and crazy enough, rippner and reisert sit next to each other. for the next half-hour, lisa is terrorized, tormented, and terrified by rippner. i won't give anything away. then we move on to where jack is chasing lisa in the airport. then lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay, and crazily enough, rippner is already there. there is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene. in total, about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the end.not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it. like i said, i will not give anything away because it's so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing/frightening. and the acting from every single character in the movie, even the ones with no lines at all, were all pitch perfect. it was incredible. everything was awesome in this movie! the acting, the music, the effects, the make-up, the directing, the editing, the writing, everything was wonderful! wes craven is definitely the master of suspense. red eye is definitely a must-see and is definitely worth spending your money on. you could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never ever get boring.red eye i have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars.original mpaa rating: pg-13: some intense sequences of violence, and languagemy mpaa rating: pg-13: some very intense sequences of violence, and languagemy canadian rating: 14a: violence, frightening scenes, disturbing content

(you'll know what i mean after you've seen red eye...) overall, red eye was a better-than-expected thriller. it gets off to a slow start, and slowly builds. but by the time it was over, it's a thumper! it's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as... thrilling as i found it. except that, simply put, the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run-of-the-mill plot. i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie. that says a lot.other factors, i think, are the "closeness" of victim and bad guy... and that over time, you begin to really relate to the victim. a scant 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5... but that's pretty good!

red eye, a movie that id had wanted to see for awhile...cillian murphy plays jack ripner (jack the ripper) a managerial pose to assassins, and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly profiled man and his family.an everyday woman "lisa" (i think) is a normal woman, goes to work, home...worries...hates to fly.the death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times.a flight where she meets jack...an ordinary seeming guy, until he suavely reveals his profession and plans, which coincidentally include her in them, she is the key to the keefe's (sp?) death.she succeeds in saving them...but nearly the cost of her life is taken, jack is beaten...the keefs are saved...oh what a story *laughs* just kidding, the movie is really good actually, the best of last year...there are small things that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie that play a great importance to the movie later... (the frankenstein pen) i watched it several times before catching all the little jokes and quirks...a must see for thriller fans no sexual, but there is a slight hint (the bathroom scene) (jack) "thanks for the quicky" and the (female attendant) "ohhh...its gonna be one of those flights" (second female attendant) "hey! this isn't a motel" you get the idea...

-a very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with. as the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man jack becomes deadly as he threatens lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in, or else have her father die. see now that's what you happens when you fly coach, stuff like that never happens in first class.-other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight, the other thing that this movie shares with "flightplan" is the sheer unbelievability *if that's a word* of the story. the point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician's room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan, but won't it have being easier for jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel's system? teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers, so i'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie.-plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about. this is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something. but i'm 100% sure that i'm reading way too much into it. the movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of "24" so one can't be perplexed by such complexities. for all my complaints though, this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done. it's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain, but at the same time it doesn't require great intelligence to fully enjoy.-i'd love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really i can't. i love rachel mcadams, i love cillian murphy, and i like brian cox, but they don't really stretch their acting muscles here. it's not really much of a problem since this isn't the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn't the least bit horrible, just not great. wes craven isn't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this, but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script. it was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing "cursed" and as much as i liked him doing something different with this movie, i still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it's release.-one nice thing about the movie which i really appreciated was just how short the movie was. it is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while, but nowadays it's like every movie that comes out feels too long, where as this movie just felt like the right length. not too long, and too short. they don't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn't the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie. being a huge film music geek, i have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by marco beltrami. it's really nice to see beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he's doing now. i really the cool techno/orchestral stuff he does for the main titles. too bad that i can't find the soundtrack anywhere, would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime i wanted instead of having to pop in the dvd when i want to hear it.-overall it's nice for what it is and whiles it's far from great cinema, should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half

this is an excellent, fast paced thriller by wes craven (nightmare on elm street), who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying - the evil of human beings. we are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of jackson rippner than freddy kruger, and cillian murphy (batman begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, even charismatic killer. the performances by murphy and by rachel mcadams (claire, from the wedding crashers)are brilliant. most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. it is action on a small scale, not the broad sweep of the canvas, and it is no less compelling for these limitations. the cinematography is nothing special, though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet, but the dialog is excellent, the story taut. there are no distractions, no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters. by keeping his focus and avoiding distractions, wes craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting, fast-paced action thriller.

lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami. she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies. the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it up.it's a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that jackson has set up. the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane. there could have more to the plane but other than that, the whole movie was pretty good.i especially liked the ending because it was heart-stopping. i didn't know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it. for me, this movie just took off.

"i didn't want this to get complicated, leese. i have to assume she's gonna read that." fear takes flight at 30,000 feet in this taut, action thriller. an overnight flight to miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when lisa ( rachel mcadams) realizes her seatmate ( cillian murphy) is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot. as the minutes tick by, she's in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late.one of the many reasons i love this movie, is because of the chemistry between the two stars, mcadams and murphy, who are also two of my top favorite actors. for example, the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people keep running into each other.... i got to hand it to the two as well, for making a film like this work. especially, murphy's character.. jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent, yet he's trying to do his job and make lisa feel trapped physically and mentally. i mean, in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for lisa.a great thrill ride all the way through. a lot of films i would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about, but actually i wouldn't mind a prequel to this one, which would take place with jackson surveilling lisa. favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene, because it was so unexpected. there was also that nice buildup to the famous 'pen' scene. when is she going to make her move? there was also that nice change in mcadam's lisa, where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back. i also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court. how great was murphy with his whole weezing.....

red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy kreuger, wes craven. wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa. after attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decides to take the red eye flight. during waiting, she meets this man named jack rippner, (how fffrreeaakkyy is that?) and they sort of become friends. ironically, both sit right next to each other on this plane. then this is when the horror starts. this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don't like thrilling/horror films, well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants. this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production. wes craven did well with this film. he chose the right actors, like rachel mcadams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is cautious of everything when she's acting in a film. cillian murphy, the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film, and his face can really widen your eyes. wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one.

this movie was released by roger corman, so you know that the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with.although, some viewers may miss the subtleties in this movie because of the very typical "obsessed killer" type marketing approach, there are unique differences about this movie.amanda, as played by the obviously talented justine priestley, is a complex character. some people like these movies precisely because the violence can seem random, but here the ramifications of past abuse (dealt with in a realistic but tasteful manner) are what shape the psychosis of amanda. surprisingly, amanda redeems herself at the end with an act of love, where most of these movies turn into the typical, all out fight to the death and the evil character dies just as evil in the end as to begin with.some rough edges in this picture, but i have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thoughtfulness and yes, originality as compared to the usual -- especially on a budget.

red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night. intense acting, great villain and unexpected action.some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 min's and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. don't worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog.a pg-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven. but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller.this movies strongest point is its cast. this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills. if they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring. we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers. cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later. rounding off this cast is brian cox from x-men 2.the pacing in this film was great. just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you. luckily this isn't a long movie and doesn't feel like it either. much better then the other flight movie flight plan.here is my flight plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578i recommend. not too long and not too shabby.8/10

red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert (rachel mcadams) is about to catch the last 'red eye' flight back to miami where she lives & works. while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome & charming jackson rippner (cillian murphy) & they both seem to hit it off, then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other. once the plane takes off & they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is & that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence, jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe (jack scalia) & they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami. jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel & make it happen or her father will be killed...directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left (1972), a nightmare on elm street (1984), the serpent and the rainbow (1989), the people under the stairs (1991) & the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short, punchy, fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes. the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed, at only 85 odd minutes in length it's a very quick moving, economical & straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight, taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots. some may like this approach like i did while other's may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick & fast without the film slowing down any & giving you a chance to relax. i really liked the plot for red eye, sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell, it's a film made to entertain & for me that's what it did. i really liked the two central character's, lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner (an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper) is a suitably slimy villain with a cold 'i'm only doing my job' type mentality. another plus point is that i didn't think anyone behaved overly stupid here, everyone actually seemed like human beings & the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion. i really liked this & it's one of craven's better more recent films.craven turns in a good solid tense, tight, taught & fast paced thriller with an attractive cast, some good action & a gripping plot. he certainly doesn't hang about & once he starts the action & tension he never lets up, far & away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane & once the film switches to miami & lisa's fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it's still good. a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this, i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it & looks drop dead stunning. those who see wes craven's name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since there's no horror in it at all (despite the imdb listing 'horror' as red eye's genre). i am not sure about the ending, on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some way.dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of $44,000,000 but reduced it to $25,000,000 although it's still a very well made film with glossy production values. actually shot in los angeles & florida in california. the film was supposedly written with husband & wife sean penn & robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads. as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy & is a total babe in this & worth watching the film for on her own. oh, & she puts in a decent performance too.red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely, i didn't think i would enjoy it as much as i did & i am glad i decided to watch it. this definitely gets a recommendation from me & rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this...

greetings again from the darkness. what a relief ... a thriller that actually is thrilling! new "it" girl rachel mcadams ("wedding crashers" and "the notebook") dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven ("scream" movies and "a nightmare on elm street"). craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.what makes this one work, is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes as we see mcadams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. she is a natural. when she meets cillian murphy (the scarecrow in "batman begins") in what appears to be happenstance, the film really takes flight. watching the two yuppie-types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing, is bewitching film-making! the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic. craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue.as with many thrillers, the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through, but we can't help but cringe a bit. the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests, an annoying airline passenger, cillian's injury and the fx at the hotel. the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads. sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under-utilized, but overall this is an above-average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale.

red eye is not the kind of movie that's going to win the palme d'or, but wes craven has never been that kind of director, anyway, and his branding is a good indication of what a film-goer can expect.the fact that red eye is a tight little, undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of craven's craft in producing lightweight, but generally enjoyable, box office fare. in fact, it's the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment, attention-holding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer.overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot, vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters, and the main section has a tv movie feel. however, there are definite elements of hitchcockian suspense, and echoes of schumacher's phone booth, which ultimately is a more sophisticated (and pretentious) play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in public.for a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats, it lives or dies on the characters and script. cillian's icy but eloquent jackson rippner and rachel macadams resourceful lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off. not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of adam's rib type dimension to their battle of 'male logic' against feminine 'sensitivity'.in the final portion of the film craven indulges himself a little scream style as man-chases-girl-with-knife. the most surprising revelation here is what brian cox looks like after the 'just for men' treatment, his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as super troopers, the ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of jude law.short haul fun.

i also just got back from an advanced screening of redeye and i must say i haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time. wes craven is at his best ever. he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving. this is the thriller of the year..no doubt. all the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. the f/x were great. it steadily built suspense. i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. it's been a while since i heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater. if your looking for thrills,action and a good plot this summer, redeye delivers. go see it!

on an overnight flight from los angeles to miami, lisa reisert (rachel mcadams) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die.red eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. the premise is similar to cellular and phone booth but red eye is better than both of those films. almost everything about red eye is above average including the suspense, the acting and the direction. most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie. the film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots. wes craven does a really good job behind the camera. instead of focusing on the thrills, he focuses on the story and the characters. the movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about. i also like the way wes craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on. red eye really shows his skills at storytelling.red eye also works well because of its young and talented cast. rachel mcadams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate. you may even end up cheering for her out loud. cillian murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain. the way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive. the supporting actors are also pretty good which include brain cox and jayma mays.the movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it. the setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape. overall, the tone of the film is consistently creepy. the screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though. there are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer. most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head. also, the ending is disappointing. it isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better. since the movie focuses on the characters, there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps. if you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed. in the end, red eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer. rating 8/10

beautifully filmed, well acted, tightly scripted suspense movie. had me on the edge of my seat. i liked the lead actress very much, and thought the villain was very well done. not much to chew on here in the way of a theme, but if you just get in your seat, turn your brain off, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. the plot is well worn, and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in. but that didn't bother me, as i enjoyed watching it unfold. in the old days, they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters, and there were some enticing moments when i hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines. but these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused. the plot got me by the throat fairly early on, and never let go. it's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie. as i'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense. just sit back and enjoy.

scream was wes craven's last decent thriller. since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night, including the disappointment of the scream sequels. perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him, so that when it came time for supper, he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo. finally, after who knows how many bad movies later, he gives us a delicious, ruthless, gripping, chilling suspense thriller with red eye.rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel. then she meets jackson ripner (cillian murphy, batman beyond) at the airport, who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze. what she doesn't know is he already knows her. and he also knows her father, who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet jackson's demands- to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination.you're probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes. although this is a good old fashioned thriller, that's the beauty of it. no special effects. no cheap make up. just classic suspense. you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position.as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance. it's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry, but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it. cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking, so even if the trailer didn't reveal it, his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn't so surprising. perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire transforming into evil relentless madman. nevertheless, cillian murphy, after his true identity is established, played the role so solidly you'd really want him to die, or at least get his ass kicked.don't overlook this feature. there are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven's recent pictures. if not for the you, do it for all the times you'll see your girlfriend, or boyfriend, or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you. wes finally gets it right. aside from his trademark mastery in suspense, red eye is not without its humor as mcadams' replacement cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order. it was a relief that red eye wasn't a disappointment. instead you'll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance, murphy look creepier by the minute, and craven craft a classic traditional thriller. a flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of craven's renaissance had it arrived right after scream.

i had fun watching red eye. it's not a masterpiece, but it's well directed and structured. cillian murphy and rachel mcadams are perfect in the role. yes, it's the same old story with a different setting but wes craven gave it a good pace. at least not another scream with the usual college killer. it's nice when you can see a clean, coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character. particularly from a film-maker like craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good tv movie had it not been released theatrically. good job!

i saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. i absolutely loved it. the movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. cillian murphy is extremely creepy as the villain. for those of you who have seen batman begins, his character was much scarier in this film. he played his character very well. the scariest "bad guy," i have seen in awhile. rachel mcadams was great. everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time, as if we were on cue. the suspense is held through out the movie. the amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. i was not disappointed in the end. i felt satisfied. the trailer does not do the movie justice. the movie is much better than the trailer indicated. do not wait for this movie to come out on video. go see it. although, i did not have to pay to see this movie, i would have gladly given 10.75 to see it. enjoy!

i saw this movie when it first came out. it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picture.justine priestley is hot as the psychotic, but complex amanda. this is not your ordinary psycho movie. lots of interesting and original slants on the genre. sort of a "fatal attraction" for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of amanda's affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off.

what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock, it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously.hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time. something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. this is a thriller, but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera.rachel mcadams is wonderful as always. cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins. in the old days, there were guys who always played the bad guy. we don't see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move, but cillian murphy is really good at being bad.the directing is surprising stylish. the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up."red eye" is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling. if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller, "red eye" might be your ticket.

as one other imdb reviewer has remarked, this movie starts a bit slow, but gets considerably better as it goes along. yes, it is released by roger corman, and yes, it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy. however, the juxtapositioning of the wife's career as a rising blues singer against the husband's gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while she's away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done. utilizing a very small number of locations and characters, and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout, this movie, though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget, reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario, namely the french film "swimming pool" which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from "up against amanda." with a smaller tool set, up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations, but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre. the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past (again, very freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amanda's plight this aspect of the story elicits. the cast is excellent i think.

this is such a great film! never mind the low rating here. i really have no idea where that came from, they must be discussing a different film then. because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure. it's story was so original and charming.. i really can't think of anything bad to say about it. maybe it has to be ''your type of thing'', but, i saw this with my sister and my mother, and we all were taken by it. the acting was also very good, and that is hard to do in a film like this. but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic. i've always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new ''dark'' role very interesting. it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy, but i absolutely had no problem with that this time. even more so, i adored him. everyone who loves a good thriller/drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film, no question about that! anyone wanting to see a film with 80% bloodshed, should go rent something else, though.. but i guess the title already kind of gives that away. this is a love story, not saw 3.i give this film 4 out of five stars!!! good job!!!xxx enjoy!

lars von trier's europa is a worthy echo of the third man, about an american coming to post-world war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery.jean-marc barr plays leopold kessler, a german-american who refused to join the us army during the war, arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway. what he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies. leopold is strongly against taking any sides, but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann (barbara sukowa), the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company. her father was a nazi sympathizer, but is pardoned by the american colonel harris (eddie considine) because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again. the colonel soon enlists, or forces, leopold to be a spy (without giving him a choice or chance to think about it) to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains.soon, leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way, where everyone and everything is not what it seems. its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control. the film is endlessly unpredictable.the film stylishly shot, it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow. its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout. also, background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front. add max von sydow's hypnotic narration, and europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world.this is now a personal favorite film of mine.

this movie surprised me, it had good one-liners and laughs, + a nonstop action-packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions. this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns. the plot is solid despite what others may think, it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end. in conclusion; this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on.

this movie has everything you want from an action movie. explosions,shootouts,bad guys and worse guys. it is fun to see james belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss "the skipper. does this sounds cheesy. of course it is. but boy,did i have fun watching this movie. it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage that is made nowadays. if you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store. you could argue about the twists being predictable. but the fast pace of this movie doesn't give you time too think too much of them,which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist. but more about the journey to that moment. only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie. they probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other. pure fun!

what a good film! made men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns. james belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters , hillbillies his wife and the local sheriff( timothy dalton).you wont be disappointed, jump on board and enjoy the ride. 8 out of 10

this movie surprised me in a good way. from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller, even though it was somewhat exciting.there's a lot of nice one-liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci, he does a great job. the rest of the cast ain't half-bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat.the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film. things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things. if you don't pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it.louis morneau isn't all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the movie.made men is well worth checking out.

i bought this movie a few days ago, and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film. but when i popped it into the dvd-player, it surprised me in a very good way. james belushi plays very well as bill "the mouth" manuccie. but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff. the 'end' scene, in the house of bill is very excellent, good camera-work, nice dialogues and very good acting. bill "the mouth" manuccie has stolen 12 million dollars from the mafia. together with his wife he lives in south-carolina in a witness protection program. but the mafia tracks him down, and wants the 12 million dollar. bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out, himself.

i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy dalton's james bond and although it wasn't his deserved '3rd bond outing' it was a laugh. belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely, but was probably underused. his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men. the other brit in it was a bit shocking, but overal it was a laugh.

great entertainment from start to the end. wonderful performances by belushi, beach, dalton & railsback. some twists and many action scenes. the movie was made for me! funny lines in the screenplay, good music. dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as "redneck-villain". i must recommend this film to every action-adventure fan! 10/10

released as zentropa in north america to avoid confusion with agniezska holland's own holocaust film europa europa, this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii. the american, named leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there. he has come to take part in fixing up the country since, in his mind, it's about time germany was shown some charity. no matter how that sounds, he is not a nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-german, merely mixed up. his uncle, who works on the railroad, gets leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 germany's horrors and enigmas.this progression starts when leo, played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor jean-marc barr, meets a sultry heiress on the train played by barbara sukowa, an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains. these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's uncle kessler postures as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs. there is also udo kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in von trier's shocking second film epidemic, though here he is mere scenery.another guest at the house is eddie constantine, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber american intelligence man. he can confirm that uncle kessler was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to leo. americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than leo, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.the story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's danish director, lars von trier, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. he shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, having actors interact with rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects, caught between glass for our more precise survey.this grand jury prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. i interpret it as a film about the last legs of nazism, symbolized by the train, and the ethical accountability of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. during the time frame of the movie, and the nazi state, and such significance to the train, are dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes.the characters, music, dialogue, and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. two trains halting back and forth, barr on one and sukowa on another. an underwater shot of proliferating blood. an uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. and most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as max von sydow's voice allures us to hark back to europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.

this isn't the best bigfoot ever made, but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies, mostly showing on the sci-fi channel, this is quality stuff. it has some action, some humor, decent f/x and bigfoot. cg is used, but so are some practical f/x, which i like.overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horror/sci-fi and need a fix. it's better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled.the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. expect a bit of a lul as the characters are "developed", but know that things will pick up. if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two.

"sasquatch hunters" actually wasn't as bad as i thought.**spoilers**traveling into the woods, park rangers charles landon, (kevin o'connor) roger gordon, (matt latimore) brian stratton (david zelina) spencer combs, (rick holland) and his sister janet, (stacey branscombe) escort dr. helen gilbert, (amy shelton-white) her boss dr. ethan edwards, (gary sturm) and assistant louise keaton, (juliana dever) to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area. when they make camp, the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area. when members of the group start to disappear, they start to wander through the woods to safety. it's discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings, and the team band together to survive.the good news: this wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half-way point, when the creature attacks. that is a masterful series of scenes, as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature, and the suspense throughout the entire play-out is extremely high. the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts, heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance. also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off-screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly. they really do add much to make this part so creepy, as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard. it's quite effective, and works well. it's quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace, as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action. one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing. as a man is running through the forest from the creature, he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it. raising his hands to holler to them for help, the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily. it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing.the bad news: there was only a couple things to complain about here, and one is a usual complaint. the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi, which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might've had. the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen. it's so distracting that it's a shame a little more work wasn't put into it. i've complained about this one a lot, and is something that really should be done away with, as it doesn't look that realistic and is quite fake. another big one is the off-screen kills in here. very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away, and then finding the bloody body afterward. it's quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward. otherwise, i don't really have much of a problem with this one, as everything else that's usually critiqued about this one didn't really bother me, but it is called on for others beyond this stuff.the final verdict: i kinda liked this one, but it's still not the best sasquatch movie ever. it's not supposed to be taken seriously, and if viewed that way, it's actually quoit enjoyable. fans of these films should give this one a look, and those that like the sci-fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well.rated r: graphic language, violence and some graphic carcasses

rented the movie as a joke. my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters. it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better. no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant. i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well. "thanks for the jeep, tom!" whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made. in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy.

life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. the acting is rather amateurish, at best. the special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. the story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable. for me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell. she may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. in all life pod is much like other low-budget sci-fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable.the white star lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic (not the sister of titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.

i agree with "jerry." it's a very underrated space movie (of course, how many good low-budget ones aren't underrated?) if i remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation (but not "rip-off") of 2001, because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man, who had somehow been turned into a computer. and like hal, they tried to disconnect his "mind", but not the mechanical parts of him, and as with hal, it led to disaster. there is at least one funny moment. when the christopher cary character, who can't find any food, finds the abandoned pet bird, there's a kind of ominous moment, but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all.

wow. something of a surprise. though flawed, it is far better that i expected.the brand new space liner arcturus with some 3,000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter. without warning, the ship's cerebral (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. soon, there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship's astrogators (penny), the captain (cary), and the director of the shipping line (kenyon).it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is actingerratically. the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship andavoid personal conflicts in order to survive.the film starts out very well. the opening commercial is a very nice touch. there are obvious parallels to 2001: a space odyssey and to the historicsinking of the titanic. the film does slow down at times and has pacingproblems, but is generally well made and well acted.

the best way for me to describe europa, which is high on the list of my favourite films, is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended: "i didn't know films could be made like that". entirely original in it's visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. it's as far away from the "master and coverage" style of shooting as one can get; perfectly integrating many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice over, performance, editing, lighting, etc... all equal, none predominant. despite hollywood's "dialogue" myopia, cinema is not about dialogue, nor is it about beautiful lighting, action or music. it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where only the blending of those elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element, and the film has no meaning. "europa" is what cinema should strive to be.

i enjoyed albert pyun's "nemesis" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. a lot of people complain about the "confusing" plot to the first film, which is probably why "nemesis 2: nebula" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.this one gives the name of the first movie's hero, alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. she is raised by a tribe in africa. a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles, which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). it doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). there are subplots involving africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. the picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. it has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie.

this is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! i think that sue price did a great job in this film series (nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula (nemesis 2). though not a film of great value and sue price's acting skills not the best to have met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action! well, some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as terminator or predator, but that's not the point. the point is that a.puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). what a pity it hasn't shown yet on dvd :-(

it is not every film's job to stimulate you superficially. i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day. while this really can't be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again. this is a challenging, provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly. the problem with the movie is in its structure. its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up, just as a second ending is tacked on. though everything is technically dazzling, the movie is exactly too long by that unit. the long-delayed climax of leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late.great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; a character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isn't. the world depicted is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. keep your eyes peeled for a memorable, technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop.the compositions are stunning. whomever chose to release the (out of print) videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it. where is the dvd?it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review. you should see it at least once. you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew, but this movie ends up being richer for it. i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock's foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies. after zentropa, von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark.

critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films. europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having. other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions.i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own, and really heighten the drama of the film. a film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not.10/10 don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors.

i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it's tv movies five seconds into the picture. this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy, well-crafted mood that is established from the very start. while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver, b.c.), the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos' excellent acting.

this movie is obviously low-budget & filmed in british columbia,canada. the obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing(set in california & late 60's-80's)were well conceived.i believe this is the best & most accurate version of the zodiac killings that plagued the town of vallejo & the bay area from 1968-19? (he was never caught).edward james olmos(det. dave toschi) & george dzundza(zodiac-at the time believed to be arthur leigh allen, since cleared by dna & fingerprints)play a game of cat & mouse re-visiting crime scenes together, each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation.olmos dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing dzundza did it,still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way.dzundza totally oblivious & self absorbed(like all serial killers) to the carnage left in his wake.the only disappointment was the"over the top" ending otherwise pretty accurate.if you tire of the typical hollywood fluff or have an interest in the zodiac case,check it out.

this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be. it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this. the cheesy acting. the poorly written script. the good ol' boys. the ridiculous, yet somehow obvious, cliché, and banal premise. the riding in pickup trucks with your propped-up wife-corpse. it has it all.you will meet familiar characters: gold-digging hussy, stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own, friends-who-know-better, daddy who knows better but drives son away. and the wife-corpse. propped up. in a pick-up. wow: and the title. several things in our lives have been "texas tragedies" since watching this beauty. everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.

i just saw this movie on hbo, and it was really good...a tragic love story indeed! i really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident. it's rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped. the love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how i'd like to think love can heal someone's heart. laura leighton...all of 27 when she made this movie...was great as the woman so full of life she's able to revive this guy's heart. unfortunately, since his family is wealthy and her's is not, "problems" develop.it's playing on hbo some more times this month. check out the schedule here - http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ scheduleservlet?action_detail=detail&focus_id=598947

this was a very good movie i wished i could find it in vhs to buy,i really enjoyed this movie i would definaetly recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv, it would be well worth the time to watch it again

i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film. story lines fail, and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste. but, then i saw zentropa (europa) and my faith was renewed. not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. the narrator (max von sydow) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945. we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death. unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showing (for example) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man's final moments. i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means. i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email. enjoy it!

seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear.soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy vietnam veteran."trampa infernal" is a pretty entertaining mexican slasher that reminds me a lot "the zero boys".the film is fast-paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck.unfortunately there is not much gore,so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed.however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look.mexican horror flicks are quite obscure(i have seen only "alucarda" and "don't panic"),so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher.my rating:7 out of 10.highly recommended.

four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear. the motley coed group runs afoul of crazed vietnam veteran jesse (an effectively creepy portrayal by alberto mejia baron), who not surprisingly doesn't take kindly to any strangers trespassing on his terrain. director/co-writer pedro galindo iii relates the gripping story at a steady pace, creates a good deal of nerve-rattling tension, and delivers a fair amount of graphic gore with the brutal murder set pieces (a nasty throat slicing and a hand being blown off with a shotgun rate as the definite gruesome splatter highlights). the capable cast all give solid performances, with especially praiseworthy work by pedro fernandez as the nice, humane nacho, edith gonzalez as the feisty alejandra, charly valentino as the amiable charly, and tono mauri as antagonistic jerk mauricio. better still, both yummy blonde marisol santacruz and lovely brunette adriana vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits. antonio de anda's slick, agile cinematography, the breathtaking sylvan scenery, pedro plascencia's robust, shuddery, stirring score, the well-developed characters, and the pleasingly tight'n'trim 76 minute running time further enhance the overall sound quality of this bang-up horror/action hybrid winner.

i searched for this movie for years, apparently it ain't available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay.four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers. what they find is an ex-vietnam vet gone crazy (he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger). as soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend, she gets killed. after one of the group finds her body, they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight. once the sun comes up, all of them try and make it out, but fall victim one by one.seven bodies, not a lot of gore, but a couple of good murders, especially the girls'deaths. the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways (blown up in car, shot to death, knife through head). overall, infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late 80's. nothing new, just well acted, fast paced and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10.

talk about a blast opening, "trampa infernal" has the coolest opening credits ever! guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary "friday the 13th" theme (tsh-tsh-tsh-ha-ha-ha), the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables. promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher/backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes. two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar. according to a newspaper article, there's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it. the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls. upon arrival, however, it quickly becomes obvious they're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve. after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers, this early 90's mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid. the formula is simplistic but efficient, the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful. the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers, as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. the murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric, which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences, and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood. the forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular. "trampa internal" is a mexican slasher/survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre.

rumour has it that around the time that abba  the multi-award winning swedish disco favourites 's star had reached its zenith, the band grew disillusioned with singing in english and yearned to perform in their native tongue. soon after, problems began to emerge in the onetime-wed locked-watertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent. the band dissolved, albeit unofficially, in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists. although they have never admitted that there's any truth in those rumours, the fact remains that abba would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue. if you want to appeal to the largest money-making media market in the entire world, then you must cater for english speaking audiences.it's amazing for me how such a small island that's located a stone-throw away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most recognised, although not most widely spoken, language in the world. everyone speaks a little bit of english; whether it be simply 'hello' or a common swear word - you'll find an english speaker almost everywhere. pedro galindo obviously didn't agree, because trampa infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget dvd. that's a real shame, because it's actually a decent slasher movie that's a lot better than many of its english-speaking genre compatriots.the film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel. two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown. after some suspense and a couple of near misses, one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously. next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town. nacho and mauricio are fiercest rivals and mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft-spoken opponent, but as of yet he hasn't succeeded.later that night, whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend alejandra and his buddy charly, mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis. he says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect. nacho is at first reluctant because alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness, but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees; much to the distaste of his morally superior partner.they plan to head out to the remote region of filo de caballo, because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear. mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversary.after visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly store-keeper, the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland. hunters become hunted as they learn that the 'bear' is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy. what started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassin.i picked up trampa whilst studying in madrid from a mexican student who lived in the dorm room next-door to me. i remember that the copy i watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled, which meant i never got to see the final scenes. thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection. gallindo's slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot, which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies. it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold schwarzenegger classic predator. this is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepily-masked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panic-stricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniac's playground.despite gallindo's obvious awareness of genre platitudes (the bogeyman even uses a claw-fingered glove a la freddy kruegar); trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template. whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category, the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown. from here on, the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film, which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you. the last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry 'the majorettes', which is not necessarily a good thing.as is the case with many latin films (especially spanish flicks by almodovar and amenabar), trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story, which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewer's throat. over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner. it's a sugar-coated point, but it's handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the feature.trampa may be cheesy, but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers. the killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white valentine-style mask and the attempts at originality just about work. it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy, but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing.

that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen, never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius, the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison, forget your michael bay, ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography, europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years. now i'd be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark, but this is stupid, the fact that europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema, whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger, hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know) europa has been hidden away, absent form video stores and (until recently) any british tv channels. the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss; it's not a case of style over substance, its more a case of substance dictating style. much like his first film the element of crime, von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world, and much like element, the film begins with the main character (or in the case of europa, we the audience) being hypnotized. as we move down the tracks, the voice of the narrator (max von sydow) counts us down into a deep sleep, until we awake in europa. this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery, there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background, who is in black and white, will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour, von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot, for instance, it's no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler (jean-marc barr) is in colour, since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film. the performances are good, they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films, but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round. but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jean-marc barr in the lead role, whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides, until he erupts in the films final act. again, muck like the element of crime, the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state, left in this terrible place, with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate. europa is a tremendous film, and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming, since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time, europa, much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes. his dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled, not to mention his use of sound and production design. but since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue, but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent. 10/10

*contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk!*i loved this film. the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life. i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen. for instance, in one scene, leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. her face is huge in the back and leo's is in the foreground.one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups. it reminded me of battleship potemkin, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side. it is one of the things i love about von trier, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy.the use of text in the film was unique, like when leo's character is pushed by the word, "werewolf." i have never seen anything like that in a film.the use of black comedy in this film was well done. ernst-hugo järegård is great as leo's uncle. it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom (riget.) this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos, easier to take. it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy. it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. yet some people, like leo, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it.the voice over, done expertly well by max von sydow, is amusing too. it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo's head, which at times is a scary place to be.the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side. i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark, where bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction. actually, at one time, von trier seemed anti-woman to me, by making breaking the waves and dancer, but now i know his male characters don't fare well either! i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions, but of course, they never do!

very smart, sometimes shocking, i just love it. it shoved one more side of david's brilliant talent. he impressed me greatly! david is the best. the movie captivates your attention for every second.

with the mixed reviews this got i wasn't expecting too much, and was pleasantly surprised. it's a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters, excellent portrayals, writing that's breezy without being glib, and a good pace. it looks good too, in a funky way. apparently people either like this movie or just hate it, and i'm one who liked it.

this movie really kicked some ass. i watched it over and over and it never got boring. angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie, you should see the movie, you won't be disappointed. and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the x-files is in it, david duchovny.

i'd always wanted david duchovney to go into the movie business, and finally he did, and he made me proud. this movie lived up to what i had hoped for. duchovney played his character very well, managing to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing the agent molder we are used to. therefore, i give him extra credit for his role, also because i could not see anyone else playing that particular character. david was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic timothy hutton. a brilliant performance that you don't get tired of throughout the movie, because he never fails to surprise you. he has weaknesses, and strengths, making the story all the more believable. i also very much enjoyed the narration, it added to the story a good deal, and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time. this movie also had a wounderfull score. i recomend this for anyone who likes drama, and doesn't mind blood.

like i said its a hidden surprise. it well written well acted and well cast. i liked everything in this movie. look its hollywood all right but the brighter side. angelina jolie is great in this and i'm totally watching every movie with her in that i can get my hands on. well worth a look.

david duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in californication - the troubled talent. and it is a role he plays well.this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end. timothy hutton plays a fine villain and angelina jolie pouts. the story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted. drug addiction and a desire for the sultry jolie mix a heady cocktail. unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene. but, that aside, a movie worth seeing.

this film has a lot of raw potential. the script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good, though some of the experimentation just doesn't work. the main problem here is david duchovny. once a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he's incapable of playing anything but fox mulder. he postures, he tries to be slick, he poses, he tries to be macho. in the end he just tries too hard. he overplays his character, he overspeaks his lines, and he's just outplayed in all ways by timothy hutton and angelina jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill. timothy hutton was (as always) really good. there was a spotty moment or two where he over-dramatized his role, but you could tell he was having fun with it. he looked the part, and he became the character both physically and atmospherically. angelina jolie was also really good. she didn't have much of a role; in fact, i though she could have used a much stronger one...her character wasn't nearly developed enough, though she did remarkably well with what she had. and the chemistry between her and hutton was apparent (gee, maybe that's why uma left him...;) all in all, it was rough around the edges, but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles. if david duchovny hadn't ripped his role to pieces it would've been *that* much better. 7/10.

i enjoyed this movie. unlike like some of the pumped up, steroid trash that is passed off as action movies, playing god is simple and realistic, with characters that are believable, action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end.well directed, well acted and a good story.

david duchovny plays the lead role in this film.now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.very unfair to say the least.david made his name on the x-files and is a decent actor. dr eugene sands(duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond blossom.however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to snare blossom. angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.she puts in a solid performance. timothy hutton playing blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible.his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film

normally, i don't watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar. this movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes, but the characters and the originality of the film's premise made it much easier to watch. david duchovny bended his normal acting approach, which was great to see. angelina jolie, of course, was beautiful and did great acting. great cast all together. a must see for people bored with the same old action movie.

okay, truthfully, i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself, what are the producers thinking? hutton, jolie, and duchovny? how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with jolie's natural power on the screen? but surprisingly, the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss. even david's humor matched up to jolie's spark and fire. as for hutton, he played the psycho very well, contrasting with david's calm delivery of life threatening situations. overall, i was very impressed with the writing and character development. i gave it 8 stars.

i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod. if you don't expect anything else, such as clever plot twists and believable character development, you won't be disappointed. consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people, especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' (suzanna arquette, who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter).mandy's face is a little too perfect, but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire, up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness, a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips, and splendidly configured legs, right down to her feet. (there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio).and no flat butt to boot, which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres'. mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no. 2, but from all i could see from her bikini shots, she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it.mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones. her bisexual nature (allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no. 2, who also happened to be her mother's lover) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses (always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason).mandy's uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse. if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress, i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages, especially italian and spanish - and maybe french, although i don't know if they would go for her type. but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic, and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground.vambo drule.

lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques. some of them are very original while others are best forgotten.he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey. with so many cities lying in ruins, leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration. it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line. his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers. when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles. a terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished. there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details.the railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations. in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half-starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz . these images, horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected.at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb. in view of many by-standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage. he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock. later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank. looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock. if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task. quite ridiculous in fact. it could only happen in a dream.it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train.despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, i prefer lars von trier's later films (breaking the waves and the idiots). the bomb scene described above really put me off. perhaps i'm a realist.

zentropa is the most original movie i've seen in years. if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir, then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days. von trier's follow-ups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim, but this is really his best work. it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor. it's too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future. it's hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here, but it's everyone's loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead.

zentropa has much in common with the third man, another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar europe. like ttm, there is much inventive camera work. there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand, and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives.but i'd have to say that the third man has a more well-crafted storyline. zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. this movie is unrelentingly grim--"noir" in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine. grim, but intriguing, and frightening.

von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world. so as viewers we think we watch a "true" story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated, often to the point that the movie works disturbing (dancer in the dark) or painful (the idiots/ idioterne). of course the dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier).the story is typical for von trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relations with everybody else, but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves. the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist. mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to (self-)destruction. (these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark.) the movie is also full of cynical (even humorous) undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post-war germany.as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed: shifting and fading washed-out colors, screen overlays, action on different overlays (with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting). in this movie we can see how good von trier's handles film as a technical medium. in his later works he seems to step down from this (as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available).

i watched the babysitter as part of bci eclipse' drive-in cult classics (featuring crown international pictures releases) on dvd. i think it is a very good film.this movie packs a lot of story into a very short time. you have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail, and murder, all in one spot! the lead actors do a credible job. and, i found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting.however, the supporting cast, primarily the bikers, delivers a stilted performance, particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words. perhaps they used real bikers, instead of actors. a couple of the characters, in particular, were exceptionally believable.the musical score is absolutely spot-on, for the times, the tempo, and for moving the story forward. i found the music a real treat. i noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of "the food," i googled them; but, couldn't find anything...in any case, george e. carey who wrote, produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much (of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation; and, a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in "weekend with the babysitter."

frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney george maxwell (a fine performance by george e. carey, who also produced this picture) can't stand his naggy, frigid wife edith (a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy) anymore. worse yet, poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (dishy brunette sheri jackson). george has an adulterous fling with lovely, enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson (delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer). complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman (a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams), who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey (a frightening robert tessier, who sports a head full of hair here) from jail. director tom laughlin (yep, the same dude who portrayed billy jack!) and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, sizzling soft-core sex, and raw violence. moreover, they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time, thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome. one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking, wailing rock music, and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. robert o. ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. stanton fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on. best of all, this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie patricia wymer, who positively lights up the screen with her sweet, bubbly personality and captivating beauty. a total trashy treat.

this familiar story of an older man/younger woman is surprisingly hard-edged. bikers, hippies, free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black-and-white indie effort. lead actress patricia wymer, as the titular "candy," gives the finest performance of her career (spanning all of 3 drive-in epics). wymer was precocious and fetching in the young graduates (1971), but gives a more serious performance in the babysitter. the occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but well-handled by the director. leads wymer and george e. carey sell the may/december romance believably. there are enough similarities between the babysitter and the young graduates to make one wonder if the same director helmed the latter film as well. patricia wymer, where are you?hailing from seattle, wa, miss wymer had appeared as a dancer on the tv rock and roll show malibu u, before gracing the cover (as well as appearing in an eight-page spread) of the august, 1968 issue of "best for men," a tasteful adults-only magazine. she also appeared as a coven witch in the popular 1969 cult drive-in shocker the witchmaker.the babysitter has finally made its home video debut, as part of the eight-film bci box set drive-in cult classics vol. 3, which is available from amazon.com and some retail stores such as best buy.

with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity, this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene. the movie plays much like a dream, and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it. characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless. but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices. the film works isn't trying to work as history, but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies. i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie, but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away. this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever, and there is a wild imagination in its style. i can completely understand why people would hate it, but i give it 9/10.

on october of 1945, the american german descendant leopold kessler (jean-marc barr) arrives in a post-war frankfurt and his bitter uncle kessler (ernst-hugo järegård) gets a job for him in the zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor. while traveling in the train learning his profession, he sees the destructed occupied germany and meets katharina hartmann (barbara sukowa), the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of zentropa, max hartmann (jørgen reenberg). leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the germans, and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called "werewolves" killing the sympathizers of the allied and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces. he falls in love for katharina, and sooner she discloses that she was a "werewolf". when max commits suicide, leopold is also pressed by the "werewolves" and need to take a position and a decision."europa" is an impressive and anguishing kafkanian story of the great danish director lars von trier. using an expressionist style that recalls fritz lang and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details, this movie discloses a difficult period of germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the jew that should identify max. jean-marc barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody. the hypnotic narration of max von sydow is another touch of class in this awarded film. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "europa"

okay. yes, this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors (like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part, and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). but come on. richard grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). steven ford was very likable. mancuso had some great lines, while nancy allen, ironically, was completely bland and uninteresting. classic? no. bad parts? yes. entertaining? big yes. i would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have. "are you fast?" ... "y'ain't that fast."

this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard grieco,(rex),"dead easy",'04, decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot, sexy waitress. while rex steps out of the cafe, he sees a state trooper and asks him,"are you fast?" and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one. nancy allen (maggie hewitt),"dressed to kill,",'80, is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast. maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down, western style, with the local top cop in town. this is a different film, however, nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together!

an unusually straight-faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. imperfect, as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama is involving-- it's one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on cinemax 2 or more max or whatever they call it, you end up watching 40 minute blocks when you're supposed to be going to work. along w/ "deathstalker 2", "chopping mall", and "the assault", a reminder that wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low-budget brethern, who has a real ability to pace a genre film, when he actually's interested in the material (i.e., don't bother watching any of his shannon tweed flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title!) actors who've had too little to do recently (mancuso, ford, even gary sandy for chrissakes) really put their all into some of their best roles in years -- as for grieco, he has the right look, although his acting is a bit one-note -- it's clear his character is supposed to be self-destructing throughout the film, but grieco doesn't quite convey it. i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote "sorority house massacre 2" & "dinosaur island" for the director -- both minor classics in their own rights, but obviously "silly" roger cormon-like cinema -- this one's more like some of the better jonathan demme and jonathan kaplan b-pictures of the 70's -- giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time -- a real step forward. not "citizen kane," and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive, but a well-written, character-driven above-average straight-to-video actioner. small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along, which is rare enough (as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert pyun monstrosity called "heatseeker" the other night -- this low-budget stuff isn't as easy as it looks -- but that's another story!)

i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much!it was well acted,particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey.it was a very interesting movie,filled with drama and suspense,from the beginning to the very end.i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie,it is excellent and has great acting!!

i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie. i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class. but, for once a tv movie caught my interest. more importantly helen hunt caught my eye. i really wasn't a big fan of hers prior to this film. sure i liked twister and as good as it gets. but, something about this movie really did it for me. i would now see myself as a huge fan. this movie comes with high marks from...me. give it a chance, it won't let you down.

this is the fifth von trier film i have seen. i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies. four of them, the element of crime, europa, breaking the waves, and dancer in the dark, i have given a 10, and one, the idiots, i have given a 9 (and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it, although i'd like to see it once more before i do). he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors. i tend to agree with him. i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films. in 50 years, when von trier retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name. he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time. it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this.about europa itself, i'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong. i think that's the point. this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare, or the subconscious at some level. this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: max von sydow's narration. we are hypnotized, or von trier is hypnotized, and this is our/his subconscious mind. i'm inclined to lean more towards his mind, since the degradation of europe concerns me, an american, very little. this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime, an even more brilliant film than this (although i am disputing that in my mind; what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd, hopefully criterion again, with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture; then, i am fairly sure, this film would seem as great as any of von trier's other films). in the element of crime, the film begins with a hypnotist, whom we actually see on screen this time, is hypnotizing fisher, a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish. the first words of that film are "fantasy is okay, but my job is to keep you on track." and whenever fisher, the narrator, gets off track, the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story. he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line. something along the lines of, "do you understand the difference between good and evil?" the hypnotist laughs and says, "now, fisher, she didn't really say that, did she?"so the key to interpreting europa, almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime, is that we are deep in our/von trier's subconscious, and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone. what does the train itself symbolize? consider it internally, and only then discuss it externally. europa is a great film, a masterpiece. i was never bored by it, even though i watched it at 3 am. the perfect time to watch, actually, since it works in dream logic.

**spoilers** highly charge police drama about a serial killer loose in and around the small town of riverside wisconsin. who's being tracked down by the local police using policewoman gina pulasky, helen hunt,as an undercover decoy to catch him. nothing new in this made for tv movie that you haven't seen before but the depth of the acting and screenplay is unusually good and brings out a lot about not only the killer but the policewoman's, as well as her fellow policeman lover, state of mind.having been put under psychiatric care after shooting an armed and unstable assailant, who attacked her partner with a rifle. officer palusky is given the task to go undercover to get close to murder suspect kayle timler, steven webber. after he was positively identified by the little girl sahsa, kim kluznick,who saw him not far from where little timmy curtis was found stabbed, 18 times, to death the next day.getting a job at the mr. "c" diner where tim works gina gets to become very friendly with him and later tells him, in order to get tim to open up, about him possibly being the serial murderer that she once killed in a hit-and-run accident a 79 year old woman. tim who is said to have a genius iq doesn't seem to pick up on gina's attempt to trap him even when he later sees her at a bowling alley with her fellow cops spending a night out. playing some weird cat and mouse game with her tim at one point get's gina, at knife point, to admit that she's wired. but gina tells him that she was forced to do it by the police to get a break and an early release from prison. besides tim's instability and criminal actions we find out that gina isn't all there as well.she seems to be suffering from her being rejected by her father who left her, with a drunk and abusing mother, as a young girl that's effecting her work as an undercover policewoman. there's also the fact that gina's lover policeman will mccaid (jeff fahey), who's estranged from his wife and two kids, who's also on the serial murder case is too overprotective of her. that causes gina to almost blow her cover and that has her later being taken off her assignment. put back on undercover duty by her boss capt. cheney (dan conway), over the objections of officer mccaid, after another young boy, 12 year-old davy marish,was found murdered gina finally get's herself together and gets tim to admit that he's the person who's responsible for the string of murders in the area. gina does it by having a hidden tape recorder that she replaced the one that she gave to him to show how honest she is, hidden on her.the movie "in the company of darkness" wasn't really that exceptional but the acting by helen hunt jeff fahey and especially steven webber was. it was these high caliber performances that lifted the film well above the average made for tv movie were used to seeing.

this is one of the best movies out there and that's saying a lot being that it was for television. i really wish it was on d.v.d.helen hunt gave such a raw performance. she played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly. when she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing. she is so alone, so he gets to her. when she talks about her mother! wow!steven weber as the serial killer was so shocking! he really brought her into his dark world. it was oscar-worthy. when he talks about killing the kids, scary! when he realizes who she really is! what a scene!!they really don't make them like that anymore. it was a real thriller without being gory.

chalk this one up in the win column, this was a superb movie. the acting performances were great and the script was equally great.helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky. gina was a complex character. she was a rookie cop with the riverside police dept. she ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids, all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer. jeff fahey (the ray liotta look alike) did a bang up job as the confused, often stammering, police officer that had an affair with gina. he was stoic as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra-marital affair.steven weber, most notably from the sitcom "wings", did a nice job as the quiet, meek, underachieving sociopath. on the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer. weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys.the entire movie was spectacular. each scene, each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters. the production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days, if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie. this movie was a good example of doing a lot with little.

more tv movies ought to be made like this one. i saw it way back in '93 when it was first on tv. helen hunt and steven weber were both terrific, giving very gritty and realistic performances. weber was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer. this film really increased my respect for hunt as an actress. the director also directed "hoosiers," which was somehow both formulaic and exciting. but the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple realism that is so appealing. if you like tv movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting, see it if you can. the side story about hunt and fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story.

when a small town is threatened by a child killer, a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend. as she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer her psyche begins to take a beating causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal. not a film of high voltage excitement, but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser.

i have seen this movie more than several times, on tv. i always watch it again...never turning the channel. this movie is full of chilling surprises, and absolutely edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, without being overbearing or stupid. helen hunt's talent is magnificently shown in this movie! i recommend this movie to anyone!!!

i just finished viewing this finely conceived, and beautifully acted/directed movie. it was nip and tuck as to whether i was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the lifetime movie network because of the horribly distracting commercials. reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot. after all the worst that could happen would be that i might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug spray ads. so why did i watch it? mainly because when imdb gives a movie a "weighted average" of 5.8 who's statistical average was 7.3 it must be a sure hit.i was totally delighted to have taken the time to view this movie, commercial pox and all. helen hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role.the portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet perceptively human police officer was beautifully executed. when the scene calls for quick witted, timely delivered verbal intercourse, she can stand toe to toe with any actor. yet she is adept at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without uttering a word relying only on facial expression and body language. without the commercials, which by design kill the continuity of any good film, this would have been a real edge-of-the-seat nail-biter. i gave it a 9.0

storyline: max von sydow's voice-over narration hypnotizes the protagonist (and audience) back to 1945 where our protagonist the young american ideologist leopold kessler (jean-marc barr) has just arrived in post-wwii 1945 germany to help rebuilding the damaged country. uncle kessler (ernst-hugo järegård) supplies leopold with a job in the big zentropa train corporation, but soon leopold falls in love with katharina hartmann (barbara sukowa); daughter of zentropa owner max hartmann (jørgen reenberg). leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption, being taken advantage of, losing his ideology, and is forced to chose between pest or colera.mysterious, mesmerizing, manipulative, noirish, haunting, beautiful, and ugly. these are some immediate, grandiose, descriptions that come to mind when thinking of lars von trier's 1991 masterpiece europa; the final chapter of the europa trilogy. in usa it was retitled zentropa so audiences wouldn't confuse it with agnieszka holland's europa europa from 1990 (equally a wwii drama). the europa trilogy also consists of forbrydelsens element from 1984 and epidemic from 1987 (the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the danish cinemas). the trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism, although the themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals. in the opening-shot of europa we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us: "on the mental count of ten, you will be in europa. be there at ten. i say: ten". a metaphor for movies' ability to transport us into a subconscious dream-reality.europa utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style -- that famous russian director andrei tarkovsky is trier's main-influence says it all. it's a black-and-white movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood, a red dress etc. according to rumors this inspired steven spielberg to use the similar effect in shindler's list from 1993 (coincidentially another wwii drama). furthermore trier uses so-called dutch angels and reinvents background-projection by adding separately shot co-operating layers upon layers, but unlike old hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons, trier uses it for artistic reasons. these carefully executed strange-looking visual techniques underline that we are in a dream-reality, we are hypnotized; the universe of europa is not real! europa is often criticized for weighing advanced technique (such as multi-layered background-projection) above plot and characters, but hey that's what reviewers criticized stanley kubrick's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001: a space odyssey for -- nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinema-history books.europa also gets accused of historical incorrectness. apparently trier assigns the nazis' werewolf terrorist-group too much historical significance. according to various online-sources that's correct (a fascinating subject - try googl'ing it yourself!), yet trier's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately. europa is a never-ending nightmare. leopold kessler is hypnotized, therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality. equally it shows how our memory deceives us -- a 100% accurate reconstruction is a lie! although young audiences who experience europa are too young to have memories from wwii, we have a collective memory of it from various bbc documentaries, so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose: they inform us us that we are not in post-wwii germany 1945, but in leopolds memory of it.all three europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence. the ambiguous endings of forbrydelsens element and europa show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities. before, during and after shooting europa in 1990 in poland, lars von trier and co-writer niels vørsel were extremely interested in wwii. it shows. it's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the time-period spot-on. a great example is the old polish church (europa was shot in poland primarily for economic reasons) in the last act of europa. as with 2001: space odyssey i think europa will receive it's rightfully deserved place in cinema-history. its method of twisting old film-noir love-affair clichés and visual techniques is so unique, strange and completely different from anything you will see from hollywood nowadays, or any other dream-factory for that matter.europa is an essential movie in the lars von trier catalog. some write it off as pure commercial speculation, but that would be catastrophic. it's right up there with other trier classics and semi-classics such as forbrydelsens element from 1984, the tv-series riget from 1993 and dogville from 2003. it's a unique experience from before trier cared for his actors, and before the dogme95 manifesto. watch it! "on the count of ten..." 9/10

a few years ago, a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film 'heat' on it. after we finished that movie, and were about to stand up, we saw that there is another film just after, tough on the cassette's envelope the owner didn't write it up. yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits.some two hours later, i just sat there wondering: how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before?...this film was europa. lars von trier woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war german photographs i saw. and then the tricky cuts!the story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy end. a young american pacifist of german descent comes to post-war germany, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped. but he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance. he hires with zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on mitropa), whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash. our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf, nazi post-war terrorists. when he doesn't understand the world (or just europeans) anymore, in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved.as a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup. after an ss unit assassinated the major of allied-occupied aachen, two months before the capitulation, the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the werewolf. but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training, and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with hitler's death and the war's end it all fell apart.however, the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. they feared the werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). for example, when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombed-out bremen, or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin. the effect was strongest on the soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (in large part children!) 'preemptively' on suspicion of being werewolf, and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died.

someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so-called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part, and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece. as it stands, "zentropa" (or "europa" as it is referred to outside the us) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe, namely the decimated german landscape, whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people. von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen. you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes, while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge, especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train. literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the evolution of an art form. for some reason, von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this. and while his "breaking the waves" and "dancer in the dark" are classics in their own right, it is with "zentropa" that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like a fine wine, and begs for a dvd release.

after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie, i was doubtful of giving it a go, but i had £3.99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & i'm glad i did, i enjoyed it. directed by the star of films such as chain reaction, the ring, bourne identity,(brian cox) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren't at all, i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider-man 2 the character doc ock. he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film. of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew's name, and that made me get it! and no his part isn't big at all, it's very short at the very end of the film, it's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film. i suggest you give it a go. some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing, the acting, and a bit more action. but it's watchable.

i don't understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey. he has never been a very interesting film actor. the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit. alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo, definitely not stock types. although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny.the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog, so that was certainly not a problem. the use of spanish gives it more authenticity. a very underrated movie, judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it. i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting.

the stories in this video are very entertaining, and it definately is worth a look! the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks, with a great, but unexplained twist at the end.the seond is the best of the lot, and it alone, makes this worth watching - a man is attacked by a dog, which he fears to be rabid - he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital, but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be...... great twist at the end, and this episode alone scores 10/10! if the others were up to par with this one, this would get 10/10!the third is the weakest of the bunch - a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! there appears to be no point to the story until the end, with a good little twist, but it is spoiled by the awful first part!never the less, this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all! well worth a rental!

rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre, sergio martino. fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ernesto gestaldi, this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film. it's when everything has fallen into place that we can go, "ahh.." the film revolves around the death of a husband(..in an airplane explosion)and the million dollars the wife receives from it. there are those with great interest in that money, one in particular being the dead man's mistress. the wife is lisa(ida galli)and the mistress demanding half the money is lara(janine reynaud). she tells lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money. lara says she'll use her "lawyer", sharif(luis barboo)to get that money. so already, the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of lisa, who awaiting someone in tokyo. george hilton portrays peter lynch. peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means. when, on his watch, lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room, he is a possible suspect. he decides to do a little investigating himself, while also assisting inspector stavros(luigi pistilli)and interpol agent, benton(tom felleghy)on their quest to find a killer. the killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of lisa. soon, the film follows a journalist, cléo dupont(the delicious, luscious anita strindberg)as she and peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her. soon they fall deeply in love, but it seems like anyone who is near peter is killed. soon someone attacks cléo with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory. why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people.this giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow. the film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer. this film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken(the throat and lower torso). the film's conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying. the film has some unique camera angles, but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery.

the case of the scorpion's tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by sergio martino, who appears to be a giallo master second only to dario argento.ernesto gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery. it also makes sense in the end, a big plus, 'cause that's not always the case for these giallo's, as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red-herrings and ultimate solutions. here, the less you know about the plot, the better.pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy music score, the gorgeous females (anita strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few.in most parts it's decently acted, goerge hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well. martino directs with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces.if you're a giallo fan, this is a must see. if you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general, this comes highly recommended.

a fine martino outing, this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads, george hilton and anita strindberg.for me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, enjoyable twists, it has to be said.sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london, athens and greek coastal locations. a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all.

lisa baumer (ida galli) is the adulteress wife of a big businessman who inherits $1million life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash while on a business trip.initially she is suspected of being responsible as her husbands will had recently been changed and so she has an insurance investigator peter lynch (george hilton)and an interpol agent on her tail just to be sure. baumer travels to athens, greece to cash in her inheritance, but insists on having it in cash...a dangerous turn of events. lynch who's identity is now known to baumer tries to protect her against a lover of her husband lara florakis who nevertheless along with her henchman sharif tries to kill them both for a share of the money that she deems she is entitled to. and this is where our masked killer starts his/her brutal killings. lynch as is customary with our hero is at first suspected by the greek police and is warned not to leave athens by police inspector stavros(luigi pistilli a familiar face in giallo and spaghettis). lynch is then aided by the gorgeous cléo dupont (anita strindberg) a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings.to say any more could ruin the film for anyone who has not seen it, so suffice to say there are enough red herrings and most of them plausible to keep mystery/thriller fans happy in this story driven giallo.the no shame dvd has a superb transfer with both english and italian soundtrack. it also has a very catchy score just for good measure by bruno nicolai that will stay in your head for a while....all in all a first rate giallo.

sergio martino has impressed me recently with his giallo classics 'the strange vice of mrs wardh' and the unforgettably titled, 'your vice is a locked room and only i have the key' - but even so, i wasn't expecting too much from this film. the case of the scorpion's tail doesn't get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic giallo discussion - but i don't know why, because this is at least as good as those two! dario argento may be the 'king' of giallo, but with the five films that he made - sergio martino surely isn't too far behind. in some ways, he even surpasses the master. all of martino's films were released prior to the jewel in argento's crown, the magnificent profondo rosso, so back in the early seventies - martino was the king! the plot here follows the idea of murder for profit, and follows the insurance payout of a wealthy man. his wife inherits $1 million, and it isn't long before there's people out for her blood! when she turns up dead shortly thereafter, an insurance investigator and a plucky, attractive young journalist follow up the case.the case of the scorpion's tail may not benefit from the beautiful edwige fenech, but it does have two of martino's collaborators on board. most famous is george hilton, who worked with marino on the strange vice of mrs wardh and all the colors of the dark, along with a number of other giallos. hilton has a great screen presence, and every time i see him in an italian thriller; it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly cast. the beautiful anita strindberg, who will be remembered from your vice is a locked room, stars alongside hilton and excellently provides the classic giallo female lead. sergio martino does a good job in the director's chair once again, with several beautiful scenes - the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting! the score by bruno nicolai (wardh) excellently sets the mood, but it is the script that, once again, is the driving force behind martino's success. ernesto gastaldi, the writer for martino's other four giallo, has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common giallo pitfall of not making sense; thus liberating this film from the rest of the illogical genre. the case of the scorpion's tail is a quality giallo film, and yet another success for the great sergio martino. if you like giallo, you'll love this!

sergio martino's the case of the scorpion's tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre. an explosion on an aeroplane results in one million dollars in insurance money for a bereaved but unfaithful wife. the money is subsequently snatched by a black-clad assassin and a series of brutal murders follow.scorpion's tail plays the mystery element, written by giallo specialist ernesto gastaldi, fairly straight. but, being a giallo, the murders themselves are memorable and well-staged. in fact, the violence in this movie is very strong in places - a scene with a broken bottle being particularly graphic. the emphasis on the violence no doubt influencing the giallo genre to move into more and more extreme territory. but like the best films in the genre the brutality is offset by a good score and attractive photography. the music by bruno nicolai is at times reminiscent of ennio morricone's avant-garde work in the bird with the crystal plumage but is also strong in its own right. the photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales - in this case london and athens - where martino manages to get in, respectively, the houses of parliament and the acropolis! there is also some inventive camera-work too, the most effective being the use of slow motion in a sequence where a woman runs towards the door where the maniac is prowling outside. in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by dario argento's crystal plumage, however, it also has the killer attempt to flick the latch open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by argento in suspiria. so martino's film is influential in its own right.this is a good solid giallo that both genre and non-genre fans can appreciate. the performances are good and the production values are fine (although the plane explosion is, shall we say, somewhat low-budget!). the dvd release by noshame is nice. it has both the english and italian language options which is a real bonus. however, it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english subtitle option. this applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras. this is a minor point though, the dvd release is a worthy addition to any giallo collection.

la coda dello scorpione (a.k.a. case of the scorpion's tail) was director sergio martino's follow-up to the wonderful giallo strano vizio della signora wardh. this is the quintessential giallo, featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love. twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitation.a group of gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-argento gialli around. there's the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director, giallo great ernesto gastaldi as the writer, bruno nicolai creating the music, and a host of giallo stars and starlets, such as george hilton, character actor luigi pistilli, and the fetching anita strindberg.with all this talent behind it, does scorpione deliver? you bet. the film works on many different levels. it's a thrilling murder mystery, a tense and violent horror film, and a suspenseful thriller. all in all one of the best gialli around.martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. at some points in the film, he almost seems to be channeling argento in his approach. for example, there is a direct rip-off of the scene in bird with the crystal plumage where the killer tries to break through the door, that actually outdoes argento's flick.are there any problems with the flick? hmmm... only minor ones. first, any scenes that aren't following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore. but just before you fall asleep, the killer will pop out of nowhere and you'll be right back in the swing of things.also, towards the end, the twists get a little too bizarre. i mean, what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve? if you don't play close attention to the dialogue, you could easily become lost with the twisting, weaving storyline.but these minor quibbles aside, la coda dello scorpione is a tense, suspenseful, classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans. seek it out!

sergio martino is a great director, who has contributed a lot to italian genre cinema and, as far as i am considered, his gialli from the 1970s are the undisputed highlights in his impressive repertoire. "la coda dello scorpione" aka. "the case of the scorpion's tale" of 1971 is one of these impressive films martino has contributed to italian horror's most original sub-genre, and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere, style and suspense. my personal favorite of the martino films i've seen so far is still the insanely brilliant "your vice is a locked room and only i have the key" of 1972, followed by "torso" (1973) and "the strange vice of mrs wardh" (1971), all of which i personally like even more than this one. that's purely a matter of personal taste, however, as "la coda dello scorpione" is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of italian horror cinema and suspense in general.the film, which delivers tantalizing suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash. insurance investigator peter lynch (george hilton) is assigned to verify the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man's wife. soon after lynch begins to investigate, a person is brutally killed, which is just the beginning of a series of murders..."the case of the scorpion's tail" excellently delivers all the elements a great giallo needs. the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning, the score by bruno nicolai is brilliant, the plot is wonderfully convoluted, and the killer's identity remains a mystery until the end. regular giallo leading-man george hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead. sexy anita strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead. the includes the great luigi pistilli, one of the most brilliant regulars of italian genre-cinema of the 60s and 70s, and alberto de mendoza, another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of italian cinema. athens, where most of the film takes place, is actually a great setting for a giallo. the atmosphere is constantly gripping, and the photography great, and bruno nicolai's ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense. long story short: "la coda dello scorpione" is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must-see for any lover of the sub-genre! stylish, suspenseful, and great in all regards!

i'm really tempted to reward "the case of the scorpion's tail" with a solid 10 out of 10 rating, but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the 1970's is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch. but even without an extra point for nostalgia, this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story, uncanny atmosphere, blood-soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices. in my humble opinion this is actually sergio martino's finest giallo, and that has got to mean something, as "the strange vice of mrs. wardh", "all the colors of the dark", "torso" and "your vice is a locked room and only i have the key" are all top-notch genre achievements as well. but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra-compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control. following her husband's peculiar death in a plane explosion (!), lisa baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and she's eager to leave the country as soon as possible. due to the bizarre circumstances, the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to greece. there, lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the case's mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money. i'm always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because i don't want to risk giving away essential plot elements. in "the case of the scorpion's tail", the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway, and i certainly don't want to ruin this for you. many red herrings follow after that, but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and, even though not a 100% satisfying, the denouement is at least surprising. it's also a very stylish film, with imaginative camera-work and excellent music by bruno nicolai. everyone' s favorite giallo muse edwige fenech oddly didn't make it to this cast (she stars in no less than 3 other supreme martino gialli), but anita strindberg ("lizard in a woman's skin", "who saw her die?") is a more than worthy replacement for her. the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  ladies' man deluxe. if you're a fan of giallo, don't wait as long as i did to watch this film!!!!

well made and stylish while still ultimately making sense this thriller would work better for non giallo fans to get interested in the genre than the later argento entries which go overboard in all directions.for fans of these crazed italian thrillers, they will appreciate george hilton and the turns his character takes and what he's put through. the camera-work is fresh with dashes of graphic violence and odd, but appropriate choices and a good not overblown music score as well. the less you know about the story the better to make it work.the only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great sergio martino directed giallo is that the story doesn't have that extra sexual or psychological, or both element to put it over the top. it's more a routine mystery, the characters are well defined but live or die according to the plot not according to their own virtues and flaws.the recent dvd (2005) release is beautiful looking and definitely the way to see the film, unless these ever get art house screenings which seems unlikely.

"the case of the scorpion's tail" has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie. the story is standard giallo. when a man dies in a plane crash his wife (ida galli) collects a $1 million life insurance policy. the widow heads to greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her. there are plenty of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (george hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. director martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. anita strindberg (also memorable in "your vice is a locked room and only i have the key" and "who saw her die?") is a stunning-looking heroine. it's one of martino's best films.

after dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film "the strange vice of mrs. wardh" (1971), director sergio martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller, "the case of the scorpion's tail." like his earlier effort, this one stars handsome macho dude george hilton, who would go on to star in martino's satanic/giallo hybrid "all the colors of the dark" the following year. "scorpion's tail" also features the actors luigi pistilli and anita strindberg, who would go on to portray an unhappy couple (to put it mildly!) in martino's "your vice is a locked room and only i have the key" (1972). (i just love that title!) i suppose edwige fenech was busy the month they shot this! anyway, this film boasts the stylish direction that martino fans would expect, as well as a twisty plot, some finely done murder set pieces, and beautiful athenian location shooting. the story this time concerns an insurance investigator (hilton) and a journalist (strindberg, here looking like farrah fawcett's prettier, smarter sister) who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of $1 million by a beautiful widow. i really thought i had this picture figured out halfway through, but i was dead wrong. although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo, i may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. highlights of the picture, for me, were anita's cat-and-mouse struggle with the killer at the end, a particularly suspenseful house break-in, and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof; lots of good action bursts in this movie! the fine folks at no shame are to be thanked for still another great-looking dvd, with nice subtitling and interesting extras. whotta great outfit it's turned out to be, in its ongoing quest to bring these lost italian gems back from oblivion.

an excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman. one of the cop (périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (montand). the unlucky montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and périer doesnt know either that montand had an affair with the girl. montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a great ending! highly recommended.

great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. montand gives the concept of the 'lone wolf' police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility.when a typical hollywood cop-heroe loses family, friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief. but when the sixty seconds are over, he pulls himself together, packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one.montand's marc ferrot, however, is really devastated - by his girlfriends murder, of course, but also by finding out that she had another lover.in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene. thus all his actions become unescapably logical. this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one.

like his elder brothers, claude sautet and jean-pierre melville, alain corneau began to cut his teeth in french cinema with a series of fine thrillers: "la menace" (1977) and "série noire" (1979) among others. "police python 357" is a good example of how corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career. they had a splendid cinematography, painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake.the police superintendent ferrot (yves montand) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone. he makes the acquaintance of a young woman sylvia léopardi (stefania sandrelli) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover: his superior ganay (françois périer). when the latter learns it, he kills her in a fit of anger. ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him...one could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes, one can see right through it but corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling, dusky atmosphere. the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however, it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment. corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary, minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation. in spite of drawbacks, corneau and his scenarist daniel boulanger penned a deft story. ménard (mathieu carrière) who sometimes expresses his surprise because ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation. but his superior knows that he usually works alone. actually, ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself. eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns ferrot himself. he's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization. it is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them.the backdrop of this thriller, orléans is efficiently enhanced by corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm.

i thought this movie did a down right good job. it wasn't as creative or original as the first, but who was expecting it to be. it was a whole lotta fun. the more i think about it the more i like it, and when it comes out on dvd i'm going to pay the money for it very proudly, every last cent. sharon stone is great, she always is, even if her movie is horrible(catwoman), but this movie isn't, this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime, and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs. don't wait for it to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. don't expect a masterpiece, or something thats gripping and soul touching, just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs.all in all, this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven't seen it see it, because what the critics and box office say doesn't always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you might just enjoy it. i tip my hat to this movie8/10

just the kind of movie i love. some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone. catherine tramell (stone) masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people's lives, playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book. she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows. tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the 'never visit after dark' side of town. from the beginning, there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone. stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter, an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan.

really, i think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film. in fact, the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining.yes, the script is a little convoluted, but that's the genre. the film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. just like all the old noir classics, this, too, has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first, and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together. that's the genre. in general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and, in turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer.sharon stone is also an easy target. the truth is she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious, sexy and fun.the direction is more than passable, because let's face it--you have to keep an audience interested in the "did she or didn't she?" question for two hours. in addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by stone, this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines to go along with stone's sexy curves. the frame is always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye.the film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real, particularly the sex. "katherine tramell is bisexual...how shocking!" becomes treated more matter-of-factly here, and typically, the sexuality of the film is used to better effect. it is still titillating, but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first. i won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because, let's face it, this film is supposed to be fun.and a fun film it is. it may be an easy target, but if you watch it for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-didn't-she who-dunnit, you're bound to enjoy it (no pun intended).

yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass. he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind.the acting was good (apart from thewlis)stone really has a talent with this role. she's slick, naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first.she really impressed me(like in casino). morrisey was also good. he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. thewlis however was lame. he ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. he really sucked.overall, this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch. just ignore thewlis.

i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role. compared to sharon stone, madonna is too coarse and bauerisch. she's not even close. evil incarnate: sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth, the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding. however, she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. in the obligatory sex scene, she projects pure, crystalline lust. especially her hooded, luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure. thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques, the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest. rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow (yes, yeats). the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual londonscapes .the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed. i wouldn't have had a chance.the original basic instinct; attempts at censorship: i must briefly comment on the original 1992 film, set in san francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. it is outstanding, from the music to the locations to the sets, and so on. paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew. that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups. attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. swell. these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas. example: sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy. on locations in san francisco, the gentle, tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. the executive producers, mario kassar and andrew vajna, vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics. blowback: thanks to the fulminating activists, the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising. their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched. it also received widespread critical acclaim. it was, in the words of the reptilian hackett in network, "a big- titted hit!" sorry, gentle reader; i just couldn't resist that one. yes, it's a gibe.in conclusion, i believe that both basic instinct 1 and 2, with their brilliant musical scores, aesthetics and acting, are works of art that deserve protection under our constitution.

let me be up-front, i like pulp. however it is like one of these "easier dives" that you see at the olympics. it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of, say, a late medieval painter.this is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often (or more accurately, most of the time!) ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains. if not always in the right way. check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle.(however quite why it has been given a "worst film" razzie is baffling - i bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006, but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim.) head case and popular novelist catherine tramell (sharon stone) is now over in london writing a novel, but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather. god heavens, she can't even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand hollywood style.yes, clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around (if you like your pulse to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? i mean why would anyone put two-and-two together and start thinking she might be a murderer? equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual. however is this just a personality disorder (some form of b/s risk addiction) or further evidence of her guilt? for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass (david morrissey) for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another "lover found dead in mysterious circumstances". thankfully (for stone) he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home/working life of his own. in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur.in to this heady mix comes roy washburn (a strange welsh sounding david thewlis) who tells the love struck doctor - in his capacity of policeman of many years standing - that the lady in question may be dangerous. i mean, hold the front page. however glass is now too glassy-eyed to realise or care. like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime-time mike tyson he ripe for the big take-down, however not before finding that washburn might have a secret or two himself.now comes millena gardosh (charlotte rampling) a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this film) of someone who isn't barking mad or else a murder suspect. presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of stone's - thankfully (for us at least) those days are long gone. strangely she doesn't think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else - or else she doesn't think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting.after several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff-hanger/twist, that while as farcical as the rest of the movie, gives us enough elbowroom for basic instinct 3 - highly unlikely this may be at this point in time.

this picks up about a year after the events in "basic instinct". catherine tramell (sharon stone) is now in london. while having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles/hour (don't ask) she goes off the road and ends up in the thames. she survives--he doesn't. the police hire psychiatrist michael glass (david morrissey) to see if she's mentally competent to stand trial. naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow.this movie was doomed before it even opened. it took forever to get a cast and director, script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (morrissey complained about the movie often). still it's not too bad. it's a lot like the first--there's a lush music score, beautiful locations, plenty of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an r), a nicely convoluted plot and good acting--but there's no impact. it feels like a retread of the first. people are being killed here with a choker leash (i believe)...just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first. in one cute moment stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly. she's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders. the similarities are too apparent.this is also very r rated--there's plenty of explicit sex talk, male nudity (morrissey looks a lot better nude than michael douglas), female nudity (stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. the acting is good across the board. stone is just fantastic here; morrissey looks miserable but is ok; charlotte rampling and david thewlis are good in supporting roles.so--this isn't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first. still i recommend it. people just attacked this because stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to "basic..." 14 years after it was made.

just came back from the first showing of basic instinct 2. i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised! if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy #2 just as much if not more. great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. the music is superb, reprising the original's theme. don't go expecting academy award material, go to see it for enjoyment and fun. that's what movies are designed for -- escapism. i can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was. am thinking about going to see it again this weekend. go see it!

what a thrill ride! twisted and thought provoking. once again, sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous, spellbinding character of author catherine tramell impeccably. the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco. the sequel takes place in london, where catherine has now relocated. both bustling cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like catherine trammel to take residency. david morrisey, ("derailed"), plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr. michael glass. the character david thewlis plays as roy washburn with scotland yard, is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series. flashy cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor,tension, - all of the "basic instincts." mind bending throughout. great screenplay. from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending, this film is anything but boring! everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.

we start all of our reviews with the following information. my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want. the point of this is that critics count for zero. your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me. the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! we never ever listen or read the critics. we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. well enough about that.this movie is very good. not just good but very good. the critics are a bunch of morons. just because there is nudity and language they hated it. it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for. is that not right? every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want

i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers. they are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct 1, perhaps someone very young ? i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewers. 14 hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i cannot think of anything serious. my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind.it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct 1 but the plot is less confused. it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way. sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well; this remains her defining role. david morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas. of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective.

i found this movie to be very good in all areas. the acting was brilliant from all characters, especially ms.stone and morissey. tramell's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. the plot is interesting even though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious,thriller like masterpiece. go see this film now , it deserves better than what it got from the audience ,which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie(before it even started).....you won't regret it,if you go see it...

i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is, i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it. i had fun watching this movie, perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be, i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing, the way she manipulates people it's just so divine. this is a very underrated movie, i lack of arguments here, i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it, when you go to the movies is to have fun, and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room. a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away. let's try not be so critical about it. thank you for reading.

i don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, unless i'm just off my rocker. i found it sick, brilliant, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated. you won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one. it has layers within layers, nuanced acting by stone,and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48,and that michael douglas isn't in this one. i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. give it a shot, you might be glad you did!

so, every year there is at least one movie, that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success, because from the moment of production, even before one simple shot is filmed, everybody's picking on this movie... there is a long list of these kind of movies, and in the end, some are really bad (battlefield earth (2000)), some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable (catwoman (2004), elektra (2005)) and then there are a few, which actually are really great for what they are, but no one admits! i mean, my gosh, just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on, not everybody has to join them. so yeaaah, maybe those movies aren't perfect, but c'mon, how many movies are? not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings! not everybody will enjoy these movies, but i bet there are more than who admit they do. hudson hawk (1991), who is just hysterical funny, color of night (1994), which may not be oscar-worthy, but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists, swept away (2002), which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance, gigli (2003), which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former "bennifer"-couple, and this year it's "basic instinct 2"! well, when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically, and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until i've finally seen this movie. and really, i was very positively surprised! i can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here. it never simply copies the original, it has a quite clever story, has tension, action, humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life! with 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s, but it's more than her being beautiful, it's brilliantly acted, with all her looks, her famous smile, the way she speaks and moves... from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her. it's simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too! so i really can't see what's wrong with this movie... it has a dark, thrilling, sexy and gritty look, strong performances, and you never felt bored! maybe the story isn't oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be! it's an entertainment-movie, and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! so give it a try!

frankly i don't understand why this movie has been such a big "flop" in publicity. sharon stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and "touch" since "basic instinct". i voted this film 10 and i tell you why: game opens in london this time. london is the city where catherine tramell has moved since the events in bi1. again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class -unchallenged. she is "screwing your brain" as catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain.as for the technical part of the film: only real setback is the b-rate crew of actors. sharon stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and michael douglas etc in the first part. i also think bi2 would have been better had sharon stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. her b-rate "assistants" are not so bad either although i would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.i think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot. i think this is a far better thriller than many of the run-off-the-mill crap hollywood so readily distributes these days. the plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you don't snore in the half way through the film and most important -the heath is on.

finally, after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of "basic instinct", we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this! i remember everything about the original, the steam, the romance, the sex, the interrogation, the music (by the master jerry goldsmith), and everything else from violence and murder, to intense confrontations of all kind! make no mistake, "basic instinct" was a real winner for audiences everywhere. i can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel. five years later, we have it. i never would have thought it to end up such as this. when it was declared a dropped project, time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with. well, i guess we now know anything's possible in this case. even if the original director, or writer are not present, all we need is the glamorous, always reliable sharon stone, and we have a done deal! please, hear me out...when people say that this film is bad, i think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme, and slightly dated. i use the word "dated" only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years, and audiences have become adapted to the pointless, boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money, and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly. who needs hole some and clean? of course it's a pleasant thing to have, but c'mon! escapism is really seldom these days, and "basic instinct 2" gives us real fans what we've been expecting. this film is not an academy award winner, nor does it try to be. it simply delivers the die-hard fans what they have been expecting. it's a film for fun. movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously, but this film is just loose and fun, not taking itself seriously, not too seriously anyway. that said, i shall evaluate the film.the film is a fast-paced film from the first second, as we see cathernine tremell in a car, speeding at 110 mph-and enjoying lustful thrills doing so. perhaps sex and driving does not mix, because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and...well, she gets away unharmed, but her studly partner doesn't fare too well. once again, tremell is the primary suspect of the accident, and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists. dr. michael glass (morrissey) is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her. like another criminal investigator before him, he is entranced and seduced, slowly, and surely. his denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do. tramell is possibly more dangerous now, than she was before,but like the first one, we'll never really know, will we? once the seduction is in motion, jealousy, rage, drugs, and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues!this film does not recycle the first one, but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time. this is a good thing. it lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two. sharon stone dazzles us again, as though 14 years has not come to pass. her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier. just awesome! david morrissey is well cast, and manages pretty well. the fact that a non-popular star was chosen, makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him, just what we see him perform. my final thought-8.5 to 9 out of 10. so it's not the first one, nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place. it can, however, live up to the standards set by the first film, and it does folks! it does.

i have no idea what people are complaining about. i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it. stone once again delivered a great character. she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct. she still has those smart but tricky answers. although sharon may be 48 years old... she looks amazing! i don't care if she's as fake as a barbie. she looks good and that's that. basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. sex, violence, and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. so don't listen to them.

i don't understand your objections to this movie. it is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created in "basic instinct". the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that sharon stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date.spoiler alert: as the movie progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) sharon stone's character is killing all these people because she's crazy (risk addicted); 2) david thewlis' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stone's character; 3) david morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge. what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the "real" story. (although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.)i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of "2001, a space odyssey." who cares what is real? the blonde really is crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. what's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. get over it!

i never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film. that goes for critics as well. sure, if it gets positive reviews that's ok and a plus, but most films that get critical rave i hate. i enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining film. it takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character...that being catherine trammell. sharon stone is awesome in this role, just like she was in the first one. anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b/c she is back acting the same way she did in basic instinct 1. catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. her one liners are great, much like in the first one. who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops, "if you're gonna arrest me do it...otherwise get the f**k out of here!" great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this one. i was captivated by her. her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, its worth the price just to see stone's performance. i cannot wait for this film to be released on dvd, uncut, because i can only imagine how much better it is going to be. and yes, there are lots of twists, as in the first one, including the ending!

i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy. no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle. let's face it, she looks good, she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! it's not an oscar or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. as such, it never claims to be either. it's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. it's the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel. fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure. the score is amazing as well.sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from david morrissey who's virtually unknown.there's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop. as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty-pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for.at the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it, and that's the movie's only intentions. so if you've got beef with mizz stone, maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?

it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip "basic instinct 2," to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released. it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older, andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful. first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself. in my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but is not as bad as most comments pretend. michael caton-jones is not paul verhoeven, neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas. "basic instinct 2" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. even stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lustful, devilish catherine trimell, who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter. she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. she became too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all those actors who have reached that level, her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiences.the rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas: his acting is flawless, giving a dense, complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character. since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from beginning to end.i am not recommending "basic instinct 2" as a great movie; i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators.

to a certain extent, i actually liked this film better than the original vampires. i found that movie to be quite misogynistic. as a woman and a horror fan, i'm used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre. but they just slap sheryl lee around way too much. in this movie, natasha wagner is a more fully-realized character, and the main bad guy is a gal! arly jover (who played a sidekick vamp in blade) is very otherworldly and deadly. jon bon jovi... okay, yeah, no great actor, but he does ok. at least he doesn't start to sing. catch it on cable if you can. it's on encore action this month.

the main problem of the first "vampires" movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic. carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blade's deacon frost. unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't carpenter use more of this??) this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been. i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence (for example inside a city) and was left somewhat disappointed. while "los muertos" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as "vampires" did). much like "vampires" however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense.most of the above may sound like "los muertos" is a bad movie but it definitely isn't. it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii. it simply could have used a bit more excitement.i'd really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it's probably not going to happen.spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable. una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual.

i admit that i am a vampire addict: i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten. i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it. this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first, and it is not quite so dark, but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original.jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss: his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives. one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems. his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds.the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film. it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night. there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme.if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one. if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.

almost too well done... "john carpenter's vampires" was entertaining, a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects. and obviously aiming on the "from dusk till dawn"-audience. "vampires: los muertos" tries the same starting with a rock-star jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters, but does that almost too well...: i haven't seen jon bon jovi in any other movie, so i am not able to compare his acting in "vampires: los muertos" to his other roles, but i was really suprised of his good performance. after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing "it' my life" or something, but kill vampires, showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done. this means a lot, because a part of the audience (also me) was probably thinking: "...just because he's a rockstar...". of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest: it could have been much worse, and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance. the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killer-machine of a vampire-leader we met in part 1 (or in similar way in "ghosts of mars"). jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy, moving as lithe as a cat, attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin, light almost transparent very erotic cloth. and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made. it really takes some beating. but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnau's "nosferatu". you can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original. this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point: the audience celebrating the fun-bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun-bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed. make no mistake: "vampires:los muertos" is a fun-bloodbath but it's just not all the time this kind of movie. just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins: the bar-massacre is what you expect from american popcorn-entertainment, the seducing-zoey-in-the-ruins-scene is almost european-like cinema (the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress, but refuses answers at the same time. because it would had slow down the action? showed the audience a vampiress with a human past, a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody). and that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not. and also: is the "from dusk till dawn"-audience really going to like this? i'm not sure about that. nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job, "vampires:los muertos" is surprisingly good. but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative, too expressive. like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience. in my opinion, wallace' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time. "vampires: los muertos" is almost too well done. (i give it 7 of 10)

at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance as derek bliss. his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films (the leading man, no looking back). but, in case anyone is still wondering, yes, jon bon jovi can act. he can act well and that's come to be expected of him. it's easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh-1.i generally would not watch a horror movie. i've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot. what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along. the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets. so, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not.unlike an action film like u-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know "the good guys" and actually care what happens to them. a few scenes are left unexplained (like derek's hallucinations) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel. unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film, that sequel will never happen. these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series.is this the best film i've ever seen in my life? no. is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? yes. it won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either. if you're somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover, this film is for you. it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other.

my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter's vampires but i don't care i loved it. jon bon jovi (derek) was great in this movie. he really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous rockstar. there were some bad things about this movie. like the story line,there should have been more to the movie.there should have been a sequel to the movie that followed the movies story line and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampires movies. i really liked the clothes that the people wore and the setting they pick in mexico. i liked how it was old mexico and not new mexico. with the clay houses and the old fashion churches. i was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to walk in churches but it was cool how they didn't follow dracula vampire rules.

the original vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. i was quite surprised at how this played out. as a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. though this one was not a great movie, the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. jon bon jovi was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent slayer. i doubt anyone could top james wood's performance in the first one, though... unless you bring in buffy!all in all, this was a decent watch & i would watch it again.i was left with two questions, though... what happened to jack crow & how did derek bliss come to be a slayer? guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination.

well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems. being a self confessed horror fan i sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect. after 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared (quite rare). the film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story. yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but the creep is a class act and proceeds to slash and dismember anything that comes its way. message for ladies !!! there are certain parts of the film you should close your eyes at or at least cross your legs !! you will understand when you see it.all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares

- small spoiler herein! - when i looked at the votes for "creep" today, i was surprised about so many imdb-users rating this movie "1". i am wondering: what do people expect of such kind of movie? are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it?"creep" is a horror movie and it is a pretty good one! this automatically means: it has a absurd story full of holes, outrageous hazards and simple one-side-characters. so why complain about it? just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then... ...enjoy to be scared to death! the first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring. there is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you. (in my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie.)when kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie. the second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (...as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the discovery channel!) so, if you want to make yourself a very, very scaring hour. just watch the first hour of "creep" and then leave the cinema or turn of your tv. you know the rest of the story anyway, don't you? the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor. but even if you watch this movie up to its end, you will not be disappointed....and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what i did after watching this movie: leave the cinema by dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home...

christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick 'creep'. 'creep' although a little bit loose on information, proves itself worthy of a true gory classic. a little less glossy than recent us horrors (amityville horror remake, house of wax remake) this dark and gruesome tale follows kate (franka potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she, and a number of others along the way, try and flee a murderous attacker. though some bad reviews have slated this film, i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that 'creep' truly does live up to its name. it delivers fast-paced gory action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best character-reaction-at-the-end i've seen in a while, 'creep' delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares.

this film exceeded my expectations. i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish, so i wasn't expecting much. however, i was pleasantly surprised. at first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died. after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character. it's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason. there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film, but explains a lot. i would recommend this film to everyone. if you're not sure just watch it anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. you're going to live for 80 years anyway.

firstly, i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense.creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. the actors are highly believable, the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. there is much mystique in this film. many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. how was 'craig' created and what happened to him?a fantastic film with a large chill factor. a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later, the bunker, dog soldiers and deathwatch.look forward to more of these fantastic films!!

creep is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. and it does just that. nothing more, nothing less. director christopher smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked. he also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague (unlawful experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at) and that little bit of mystery works for the most part. sadly, he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear (they are hinted at as well). yes, you heard me right - i wanted a clichéd twist ending! franka (run lola run) potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine.

"creep" is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous! it has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. what it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me for one second. when the end-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer christopher smith (in his debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the "creep" in the london subway. the story revolves on the young and haughty kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney who's in town to present his new film. she falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. even experienced homeless people, security guards or sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! i really dug the creep-character! he's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. i reckon this isn't very original, and i'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content, but i forgive smith and i think it's better this way than going over the top completely, "jeepers creepers"-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). the obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! there's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used. there also is some acting-talent present in this film, with franka potenta (run lola run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film "anatomie". creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director i'll keep an eye on. make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film...

star rating: ***** unmissable **** very good *** okay ** you could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs stuck-up career bitch kate (franka potente) heads to the london underground to catch a train to take her to meet george clooney. however, after a hectic working day, she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform. as she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next, however, she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there.in a lot of ways, the british film industry is really becoming one on it's own, especially in the horror thriller department, with films such as creep and the successful 28 days later (which this has strong echoes of in parts.) in terms of succeeding in what it set out to do, creep does cleverly create (especially at the beginning) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear. at it's clever running time, it also (though inadvertently, i suspect) manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through-out without really focusing too much on character development and such.of it's weaknesses, some scenes are a little predictable, but these don't really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way. i'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it's not exactly perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serves it's basic function very well. ***

i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section. to tell you the truth, the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the radiohead song, and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didn't have a choice :-d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the lambs, but it turned out to be semi-gore flick. somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable, and that is absolutely correct. i really couldn't care less if potente's character got her entrails ripped out by the creep. i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with potente's character getting her just desserts. christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film. however, the story is rather weak, but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively. the score by a bristol band called the insects was top notch. that, more than anything else, really scared the crap out of me.the director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the q&a session. i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future.this one is strictly for genre fans, but i'd recommend non-fans to give this a try anyway. it was a fun ride.

this is good little shocker; not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but tight, competent and disturbing. an excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.the set up requires no bells and whistles, no lengthy exposition or wordy back story; kate (franka pontente), a young german business woman living in london, drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train. she awakens to find the place deserted, but quickly comes to realise that she is far from alone. someone, or something, is down there with her and it's intentions are wholly malicious.in fact she encounters several other characters in her quest to survive, including a lecherous work colleague, a homeless couple and a caged sewage worker, all of whom add pace and substance to the plot. there is a slightly awkward gear change somewhere in the middle of the film when tension thriller mutates into gore fest, but nothing so clumsy as to slow the hectic pace. for those of you with weak dispositions this is likely to be a harrowing ride; for those of you who relish a bit of well executed carnal mayhem this should press all the right buttons.the climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film, but it is punctuated with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary which provides a satisfying conclusion.some may find themselves feeling somewhat cheated of a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by kate and her confederates, however, for me this was not the case. a horror film writer should not need feel compelled to dot every i and cross every t, in the same way a writer of political thrillers might be expected to. there are enough clues here to give you a very pretty clear idea of what brought this evil into existence, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. the retention of a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the ride was always going to be more important than the exact destination.my understanding is that the budget for this film was, to say the least, minimal, in which case our applause for this british horror should be all the louder, for at no point does one have the impression of corners being cut or effects failing to deliver.if this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is. buy a ticket and climb aboard.

1958. the sleepy small southern town of clarksburg. evil sheriff roy childress (the almighty vic morrow in peak nasty form) cracks down super hard on speeders by forcing said offenders off a cliff to their untimely deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road. childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver michael mccord (a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by martin sheen) shows up in town in his souped-up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother (sheen's real-life sibling joe estevez in a brief cameo). director richard t. heffron, working from a taut and intriguing script by richard compton (the same guy who directed the 70's drive-in movie gems "welcome home, soldier boys" and "macon county line"), relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, neatly creates a flavorsome 50's period setting, and ably milks plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and wills between childress and mccord. the uniformly fine cast helps a lot: sheen radiates a brash james deanesque rebellious vibe in the lead, morrow makes the most out of his meaty bad guy part, plus there are excellent supporting performances by michelle phillips as sweet diner waitress maggie, stuart margolin as a folksy deputy, nick nolte as amiable gas station attendant buzz stafford, gary morgan as buzz's endearingly gawky younger brother lyle, janit baldwin as sassy local tart sissy, britt leach as stingy cab driver johnny, and frederic downs as the stern judge j.a. hooker. the climactic vehicular confrontation between childress and mccord is a real pulse-pounding white-knuckle thrilling doozy. terry k. meade's sharp cinematography, the well-drawn characters (for example, childress became obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident), the groovy, syncopated score by luchi de jesus, and the beautiful mountainside scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made-for-tv winner.

i caught this movie about 8 years ago, and have never had it of my mind. surely someone out there will release it on video, or hey why not dvd! the ford coupe is the star.......if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away.

martin sheen, michelle phillips, stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. mr. sheen, mr. margolin and mr. morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles; ms. phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made-for-tv movie (twenty-five years ago), by supplying the "sex interest" in an otherwise sexless film. the real star, however, is the "california kid"; a 1934 ford coupe, borrowed from "jake" jacobs, put before a camera and given a workout that'll leave the viewer panting, gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation.the action scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialog is a bit lame) making for a fine evening's diversion. this is how all "car movies" should be made.try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it's well worth the missed sleep.

for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et. al., martin sheen showed us the way in this great feature.the premise is easy enough: cool hood meets small town sheriff and all-hell ensues, but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us. no, this isn't casablanca, nor is it great literature, but it is a serious movie about cars, rebellion, and the genius that is martin sheen.enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is, and for what martin will become. i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70's, and you will too.

i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. it is far superior in action than most movies since. martin sheen is excellent, and though nick nolte has a small part, he too provides excellent support. vic morrow as the villain is superb.when sheen "tests the water" in his '34 ford (cool) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!the ending is grand.i'm disappointed in the low vote this received. i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days.good taste eludes the masses!

in 1958, clarksberg was a famous speed trap town. much revenue was generated by the sheriff's department catching speeders. the ones who tried to outrun the sheriff? well, that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the clarksberg curve with his plymouth cruiser. for example, in the beginning of the movie, a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths, if i recall correctly. then one day, a stranger drove into town. possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world. michael mccord. even his name is a car name, as in mccord gaskets. in possibly the ultimate hot rod. a black flamed '34 ford coupe. the colors of death, evil and hellfire. he gets picked up for speeding by the sheriff on purpose. he checks out the lay of the land. he is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. he knows how his brother died. the clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff. there's only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so "this ain't a-ever gonna happen again to anyone": recreate the chase and settle the contest hot-rodder style to the death. he goes out to the curve and practices. the sheriff knows mccord knows. the race begins... this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road.

forget neo and bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. they only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones, hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick.however, their " action set-pieces " are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question. this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years. for better ( rocky, rambo ) or worse ( die hard 4 - where john mcclane, brace yourselves.... had no beard !! )i say it is high-time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end. this " largo winch " movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero. and the only one time where he was weakened is when mélanie thierry shaved his beard ! i rest my case.i didn't know it when i entered the theater room, but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade. for the first time in france since belmondo, can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in b-genre without blushing over its performance. in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience... in other words it was " le pacte des loups " or " dobermann " ( i like dobermann, mind you )... i believe " largo winch " has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making.i exited the theater room very pleased, and hungry for more.

when i sat down to watch 'largo winch' i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. when i stood up, i've seen both of these; and more.karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie, to start with. kristin scott thomas played her role well, but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic, both acting superbly. in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well.the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but i understand why people would get bored with it.the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me, and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island.rolls royce phantom; mercedes s500, and bmw 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; this is their movie. it is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extremal beauty, and above all, a fast - paced, well written action movie, with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama.my vote, as it has enlightened a gloomy day is: 10/10

i'm not aware of "largo winch" as a comic book (or is it graphic novel? i actually don't know), but i have to admit, hearing about an agent/hero movie, i did expect quite something different, than what i actually got.while it was startling to watch this at first, it was nice watching this move along. you could never really tell where it would go (some twists are foreseeable, but in general, you can never really say, were it will end up going). a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast, make this an enjoyable watch. not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that, but a really good mixture.

who doesn't know largo winch in the france-belgium-luxemburg trio (the three countries where the french "bd" or "bandes dessinées" are massively published) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. after a first - and failed- attempt with a tv show, the real thing begins.first of all, and that's what most of the fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. as a 1st class-fan of the comic book, i must confess i was nicely surprised. the actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast. i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial/political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet.

i am surprised at imdb's low rating of this movie. with all due respect, its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor. they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more gore.the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film. it is not, nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one. it is a psychological thriller. it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. reel.com's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie. all the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense. it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it.i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense. martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning. the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing.i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone. i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare.kudos to the acting as well. for such a low budget film, you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction, writing, and acting. please don't be fooled by the rating by imdb. this movie is worth it. i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice.

this one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold. it's horror-- but not a splatterfest. it's equal part suspense as well as horror-- yet without the usual hollywood screams and jerky camera. the feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because i think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters.forget that brendan is a graduate of the buffy universe. that's a red herring. he is acting here. 'camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story. adrienne barbeau is giving a rock solid performance-- so she must believe the script has something to say. we all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap "cut" and get their paychecks. this is not the case, here.forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-funny regularity. i don't think the intent was humorous-- but to keep you off balance. think of it less of a horror 'movie' and more of a horror 'play' on a stage-- that decrepit whitewashed house. then you might see it's really about paranoia, fear, and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace, usa.and it is twisty. time travel, mind control, secret experiments and nazi's who may not be dead. . .yet.i say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. this would be a good choice for a saturday midnight sit down.

the main problem i see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, "this is a cheap-ass movie." there's not much more to say here. the score just plain sucked.the second problem, which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between martha (adrienne barbeau) and the sunflower man (richard ziman), in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. at all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. in other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau. while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. the main point of her performance that didn't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo-like woman on a mission. this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon barbeau. to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.so what's my holistic grading of this piece? i'd give it a solid c+ to b-, depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism. i see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and nicholas brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance.all in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a nazi you love. :)

i've read some terrible things about this film, so i was prepared for the worst. "confusing. muddled. horribly structured." while there may be merit to some of these accusations, this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer. in fact, it actually had aspirations. it attempted something beyond the typical monster/slasher nonsense. and by god, there are some interesting things going on.ms. barbeau is a miracle to behold. she carries the film squarely on her shoulders.this is not to say that it's a masterpiece. unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition. there are just too many (unexplained) subplots trying to coexist. and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother, then why doesn't she just kill ma in the film's very first sequence? seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do it.still, i give unholy points for trying. a little ambition is not a bad thing.

this is what i call a "pre sci fi; sci fi" movie. it gets no better than lugosi/karloff in this incredibly good "mood" type motion picture. these two genuine artists are at their very best, as is the story line.karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity, pride, and scientific competition. i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts. i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in. this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake. this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role. it might be possible to do it almost as good.this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced. as i said..it gets no better. no way.

so many consider the black cat as the best karloff/lugosi collaboration. i disagree. the invisible ray is their best. a great storyline, fantastic special effects, and classic karloff over-acting. i love it!!

"the invisible ray" is part science fiction and part horror. it was also the third of seven karloff/lugosi features. in this entry the dominant role goes to boris karloff.through specially designed astronomical equipment, dr. janos rukh (karloff) demonstrates to colleagues dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), sir frances stevens (walter kingsford), his wife lady stevens (beulah bondi) and their nephew ronald drake (frank lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the african continent many millions of years in the past. rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to africa to find the mysterious element.rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names "radium x". due to rukh's long absences, his comely young wife diana (frances drake) becomes attracted to drake and the two fall in love. meanwhile rukh becomes contaminated by radium x to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. the contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.rukh goes to benet for help. benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.while rukh is continuing his work, sir frances takes news of the discovery back to france. diana and ronald accompany him. when benet informs him of this action, rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. when he returns to france he learns of the healing power of radium x as he cures his mother's (violet kemble cooper) blindness and of benet's work in curing the maladies of his patients.but rukh's madness intensifies. first he murders an innocent man whom is identified as rukh. upon hearing of rukh's apparent demise, diana and ronald marry. this angers rukh and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition. one night he is lured into a trap set by benet and...........karloff is excellent in the lead role moving from a happily married ambitious scientist to a raving maniac. lugosi has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part.at 79 minutes this film was the second longest of the six karloff/lugosi collaborations. karloff's film all the way.

one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray. boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd (especially the camera technique karloff, as janos rukh, uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and downright laughable, i didn't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. the effects are done well for the time, the acting is great, and the finish is particularly strong. it reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s, complete with ray guns and ridiculous science. you must watch this movie!

really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest, boris karloff and bela lugosi. dr. janos rukh(karloff)is on an expedition in africa trying to find an ancient meteorite. after finding it, rukh is poisoned by the its radiation. all he touches dies and the dark side of rukh makes him become an egotistic murderer. his friend, dr. felix benet(lugosi)finds a limited remedy to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases. the two fiends will battle over the radiations possibilities. pretty good special effects. others in the cast: frances drake, frank lawton, beulah bondi and frank reicher.

the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial. karloff plays dr. janos rukh, creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the carpathian mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe.before several guests, including lugosi as dr. benet, an astro-chemist who had previously scoffed at rukh's theories, he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element, here termed "radium x", contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago. karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories, but radium x is a tricky compound - it levels mountains at long range, and cures blindness at short range. rukh is careless, however, and poisons himself, glowing in the dark rather like those old ready breck commercials! dr. benet is on hand to devise a counter-active for the radiation, but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid. convinced he has been cheated, he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris, including his estranged wife, and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death...along the way we get the old pseudo-scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer (a remarkably distinct karloff!) and the radium x device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members. and even a touch of james whale in a cockney landlady in paris!the invisible ray is great fun, aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris. the film lacks pace, but is always absorbing. karloff slightly overdoes his performance but lugosi is terrific. universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster, this time with lon chaney jr. as the glowing menace (this time caused by electricity) and lionel atwill as a much madder doctor than lugosi is here. the invisible ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire. not as famous as other universal horrors, perhaps, but it works and is highly entertaining.

horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre-lover to watch a film, and, even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci-fi/horror gem. while lambert hillyer's "the invisible ray" of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff ("frankenstein, "bride of frankenstein", "the mummy",...) or lugosi ("white zombie", "island of the lost souls", "dracula",...), or both ("the black cat", "the raven",...), this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing. compared to other universal horror pictures, the storyline seems a bit silly, but in a delightful manner. karloff and lugosi, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography. karloff plays dr. janos rukh, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago. stunned by rukh's invention, the celebrated french scientist dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor. in africa, rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike... it is somewhat odd that karloff, who was in fact british, plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi, who was hungarian, plays a french scientist, but they are both excellent as usual. as far as i am concerned, these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory, and i am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the horror genre, and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre. by the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff. frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh's beautiful young wife. the rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. other than the casting of karloff and lugosi, the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline. my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance. he is fantastic as always, but his role could have been bigger, and more sinister. otherwise, "the invisible ray" is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror/sci-fi cinema, and a must-see for all my fellow lugosi/karloff fans.

scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. all (pseudo)science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there, including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed. when he summons his rivals -who had cast him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they propose a 'joint' expedition to africa...of course they end up stealing much of dr. rukh's original discovery, giving him only residual credit. in addition to that, an effeminate weakling who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst abbot&costello (lawton) literally steals dr. rukh's young trophy wife (drake), who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being. having grown horns like a deer wasn't going to make dr. rukh (karloff) any friendlier, so he embarks in an undercover revenge mission...killing 2 of his foes and friendly dr. benet (lugosi), the only one who had helped him...finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark in his revenge to start with but ( to my utmost dissatisfaction ) sparing the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human being she had married. acting is mostly fine, with karloff & lugosi being very good. check the hysterical chambermaid scene... other characters aren't worth mentioning... recommended, much like all old universal horrors...

prof. janos rukh (boris karloff) discovers radium x--a powerful force to be used for atomic power. unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death. dr. felix benet (bela lugosi) develops an antidote--but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him.the plot is silly and the "effects" that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable, but this is still a fun little chiller. it moves quickly, has some great atmosphere (notice rukh's "house" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and karloff and lugosi (as always) give great performances. there is also good acting by franic drake (as rukh's wife) and violet kemble cooper (as his mother). so it's ok but just a notch below all the other karloff/lugosi movies. the plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. still i did like this. i give it a 7.

the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein; and there's a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and the invisible ray is certainly one of them. the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director lambert hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film. the plot focuses on the good hearted dr janos rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth. his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it. however, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him mad...the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - boris karloff and bela lugosi, and both give excellent performances. karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with. bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in, and it's a great performance from him also; it's nice to see a bit of versatility from lugosi. the film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up. the second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well. the film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely. overall, the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but it's a very good one and comes recommended.

boris and bela do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.i saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from borders this year. this time watching it with my children,i took note of 2 things: it held the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it.very swift story with an unpredictable end. a must for movie buffs!!!

there are so many good things to say about this “b” movie.“b’ maybe in connections, but not in commission. this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen. a grade a effort by universal. the script is well done, imaginative, and without fault. writing credits: howard higgin original story & douglas hodges story, john colton (screenplay). director lambert hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well. no skimping on the loads of extras and locations. i loved beulah bondy (jimmy stewarts mother in “it’s a wonderful life”. the fem lead, frances drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her karloff husband. lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in. as i said there were so many good things: the african discovery of the radium “x”, the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the ten little indians in and then there were none (agatha christie) (the barry fitzgerald version)), the glowing of karlof in the dark. karloff’s mother played by violet kemble cooper with elegance. and because of all these virtues, i found myself believing in the science it portrayed. i guess that’s the mark of a good piece of art.

for real film people, this film is a must, since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. janos rukh/boris karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. this light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good. on the one hand it blinds his mother, on the other it is used to cure blindness ("i can see!" shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected). when rukh/karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are out).there is a wonderful passage near the beginning where karloff/rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years, as the light from andromeda was emitted from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. there are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the persona of beulah bondi/arabella stevens; and religion, emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun. one has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in germany at the time, and particularly at riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm:triumph of the will. happily in the end, mother (violet kemble cooper) intervenes, reminding janos rukh of the first rule of science. if only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout: "i can see!"

while not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as the black cat and the body snatcher), this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd. boris karloff plays dr. janos rukh, a weird scientist who lives in the carpathian mountains--near where the dracula character's home town. bela lugosi plays dr. benet--whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french. i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles, as the carpathian role seems tailor made for lugosi--especially with his accent. however, despite this unusual twist, the two still did excellent jobs. karloff's was definitely the lead role, but lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person--something he didn't play very often in films!! it seems that dr. rukh is a bit of a pariah, as other scientists (especially benet) think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical. however, over the course of the film, rukh turns out to be right and benet is especially generous in his new praise for rukh. but, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (don't you hate it when that happens?). while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story, the plot was well constructed, the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting.this film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger-budget film instead of the cheap quickies both lugosi and karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. good stuff.

okay, note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd-collections: i truly am grateful and i hugely support the initiative, but  have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection? when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role ("tower of london", "the strange door"). "the invisible ray", however, is part of the bela lugosi collection and here it's actually boris karloff who overshadows bela! this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead! bela lugosi's character is quite possibly the most good-natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here. "the invisible ray" features three main chapters. the first one, set in dr. janos rukh's carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience, but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film. dr. rukh (karloff) demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues (among them bela lugosi as dr. benet) how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self-manufactured device. the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa. there dr. rukh isolates himself from the group, discovers the essential element "radium x" to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself. the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one, as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks (melting statues) and a surprising climax. karloff glows in the dark and, convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life, he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch. the narrative structure of "the invisible ray" sounds rather complicated, but the film is easy to follow and entertaining. the story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director lambert hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense. boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi, even though he deserved to have a little more screen time. their scenes together are the highlights of the film, along with the funky images of the glowing boris.

with a special telescope, dr. janos rukh (boris karloff) successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in africa containing an unknown, but extremely powerful element. dr. benet(bela lugosi) form an expedition led by rukh to locate the element. unexpectedly, rukh discovers "radium x,", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them. the sparks really fly between lugosi and karloff in this classic science-fiction film during the post-world war ii era. director hillyer used a few standing sets from "flash gordon" series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from frankenstein. universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film. karloff and lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations.

boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together, but on the whole (interestingly enough) karloff usually is the better man of the two. the real exception is "the black cat" (1934) where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult, and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life. but more usual is "black friday", where (whatever his motive) karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug. in "the raven" lugosi is a sadistic surgeon, who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough. rarely are they both negative characters totally. in "the body snatcher", karloff does kill lugosi, but lugosi is trying to blackmail him.the one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film, which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned. in it karloff's dr. janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the "official scientific community" for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago. he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens (walter kingsford and beulah bondi), and has another scientist, a frenchman named dr. felix benet (lugosi), rukh's young wife diane (frances drake) and a friend and protégée of the stevenses named ronald drake (frank lawton).before they leave, rukh is warned by his mother (violet kemble cooper) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy. he tries to dismiss this, but he is worried by what she says, his scientific standing, and whether or not he is going to get his due credit.what he gets is a disaster. he finds the substance, but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity. he finds that he is slowly burning up, and if he tries to touch people or animals they die. he's actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet, who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger. but there are two things that are unbeatable here. the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time, and has to be replenished. and the radioactivity has affected rukh's brain. he is increasingly jealous of diane's friendship with ronald (encouraged, unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella), and he is equally upset that (due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that) benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that "radium x" is giving to man. soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives, ending with his own.the film certainly picked up on science to an extent. madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium. few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936, but some idea of it was coming out. the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a "curse" on the expedition. of course, with the idea of a "cursed" expedition (on the continent of africa) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago, financed by a titled englishman, we have entered archeology not physics or geology (paging howard carter and lord carnaevon).on the other hand, benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths, and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england. during the whitechapel murders, sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper. it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. but the idea did not die. jules verne used it in his novel "the brothers kip" in 1899, and here dr. benet uses it. as this is a science fiction story, he finds the image of rukh on the the plate, but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters.the film is good on many grounds, the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other. there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films. the other performances are good as well, in particular ms kemble cooper. she is best remembered as basil rathbone's frightening sister (jane murdstone) in "david copperfield". here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end, and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target.

there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s, the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films. after being universal's "first monster" in the seminal classic, "dracula", bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent (sadly, this last factor would also led him to be type-casted during the 40s). in the same way, boris karloff's performance in james whale's "frankenstein" transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster. of course, it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen, and the movie that united them was 1934's "the black cat". this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade, and director lambert hillyer's mix of horror and science fiction, "the invisible ray", is another of those minor classics they did in those years.in "the invisible ray", dr. janos rukh (boris karloff) is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda. while showing his invention to his colleagues, dr. felix benet (bela lugosi) and sir francis stevens (walter kingsford), they discover that thousands of years ago, a meteor hit in what is now nigeria. after this marvelous discovery, dr. rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa, looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor. this expedition won't be any beneficial for rukh, as during the expedition his wife diane (frances drake) will fall in love with ronald drake (frank lawton), an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition. however, rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip, as he'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor.written by john colton (who previously did the script for "werewolf of london"), "the invisible ray" had its roots on an original sci-fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges. given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi, colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story, playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up. one element that makes "the invisible ray" to stand out among other horror films of that era, is the way that colton plays with morality through the story. that is, there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style, but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices. in many ways, "the invisible ray" is a modern tragedy about obsessions, guilt and revenge.a seasoned director of low-budget b-movies, filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles. thanks to his experience working with limited resources, hillyer's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains, and "the invisible ray" was not an exception. while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films, hillyer's movie effectively captures the essence of colton's script, as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci-fi. finally, a word must be said about hillyer's use of special effects: for an extremely low-budget film, they look a lot better than the ones in several a-movies of the era.as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff, the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality. as the film's protagonist, boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes. as his colleague, dr. benet, bela luogis is simply a joy to watch, stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was. as rukh's wife, frances drake is extremely effective, truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress. still, two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh, and beulah bondi as lady arabella, as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time, making unforgettable their supporting roles. frank lawton is also good in his role, but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast.if one judges this movie under today's standards, it's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience. however, that would be a mistake, as despite its low-budget, it is remarkably well done for its time. on the top of that, considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept, it's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate. one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters, specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr. rukh and the cold dr. benet, as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors.while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the "frankenstein" movies, nor the elegant suspense of "the black cat", lambert hillyer's "the invisible ray" is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures' catalog of horror films. with one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror, this mixture of suspense, horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had: boris karloff and bela lugosi. 8/10

the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi. karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even his wife. his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends. this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. it is hard, however to hear his accent and believe he is french. the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science" but, in a way, even the junk science makes it work well. since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are as "relevant" today as they were when the movie was made. and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be. this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again. i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times. the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing. i highly recommend it.

this is just about in the same league as `the black cat', although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9+. that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing!`the invisible ray' is part horror, part drama and certainly part sci-fi. for a movie made in 1936 the sci-fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. the mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend, while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better.director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often. what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot. the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. it's a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre.as with `the black cat' and `island of lost souls', i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd. when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling.anyway, watch this film if you get the chance. when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library.

one doesn't get to enjoy this gem, the 1936 invisible ray, often. but no can forget it. the story is elegant. karloff, austere and embittered in his carpathian mountain retreat, is janos rukh, genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in africa. joining him is the ever-elegant lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "astro-chemistry." frances drake is the lovely, underused young wife; frank lawton the romantic temptation; and the divine violet kemble cooper is mother rukh, in a performance worthy of maria ospenskya.the story moves swiftly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still handsome. it also contains some wonderful lines. one rukh restores his mother's sight, he asks, "mother, can you see, can you see?" "yes, i can seemore clearly than ever. and what i see frightens me." even better when mother rukh says, "he broke the first law of science." i am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is.this movie is definitely desert island material.

karloff and lugosi - together again! this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much. it's not an all-out horror film like the duo's previous two hits, the black cat and the raven. but, it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when re-visited.the invisible ray was directed by lambert hillyer, a director who mainly made westerns, but curiously in these final days of the laemmles' reign at universal, he found himself helming this and the laemmles' final horror film, dracula's daughter. both are crisp, clean-cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements.just as lugosi went wild in the raven, much needs to be said of karloff's hamming in the invisible ray. the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that karloff's character, rukh, acts so madly before he is poisoned by radium x, that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing. this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining - he's basically a loony right from the start. there isn't any real transformation. same here. halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind. i still enjoyed his performance, though, just as i did lugosi's over-the-top antics in the raven.meanwhile, lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained, and thoughtful turn as rukh's rival in science, dr. benet. lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh, of which i am in alignment with horror film writer john soister on - "and if he (rukh) touches anyone?" the inspector inquires. lugosi hesitatingly replies, in a way that only lugosi could deliver, "they die". just as lugosi could be so off, he could also be more perfect than any actor. this is one of those moments.therefore, karloff and lugosi's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff pared off against the cool logic of lugosi. karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times, however, one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one. he only had one more chance (ninotchka).the invisible ray is a fun film, and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans. it is one of those films that improves on each viewing, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story complements the darker, more horrific pairings they had. the special effects, by the always innovative john fulton, are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate. frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman, something seldom seen in classic horror films. the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film. a terrific, fun film!

i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film.anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies;jfk, rfk, mlk,g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention a few.the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history.god help us,but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy.if this causes a little loss of sleep, maybe it should.don't take my word for it,investigate for yourselves.

people are being too hard on the film. sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to "review" it.the whole thing comes together when hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down. then the fun begins as everyone about him also "go down".just think jfk and all the people associated in any way with his assassination, who's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you'll appreciate what is implied in this film.i think it's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred. though the exact story line my not have been followed (hindsight here after reading jim maars "crossfire") but it's what is implied that is of interest.i'd love to get a copy of it to view it again. in light of what is known today, the domino principle is right on.

in the aftermath of watergate, a number of conspiracy movies appeared, such as this one, written by the late adam kennedy ( based on his novel ). gene hackman plays ex-vietnam veteran 'roy tucker', a loser who has wound up in prison. he receives visits from marvin tagge ( richard widmark ), who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted. they offer him freedom, and despite distrusting tagge he accepts. but he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of spiventa ( mickey rooney ). exactly why is hard to see, as spiventa is an irritating little man who drives tucker mad with persistent talk of sex, not what you want to hear when you are behind bars.tagge's benefactors kill spiventa before tucker's astonished eyes. reunited with wife ellie ( candice bergen ), and given a new identity ( strangely, he does not attempt to change his appearance. shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start ), he settles down, but finds there is a catch - tagge wants tucker to do no less than assassinate the president of the united states. he refuses, so tagge has ellie abducted...i will leave the synopsis here, but i am sure you can guess the rest for yourself. the script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book ( neat trick that! ). the people tagge represents are never revealed. the allusions to j.f.k.'s killing are unmistakable. despite the findings of the warren commission, the doubt as to whether lee harvey oswald acted alone persists to this day.this was stanley kramer's first movie in years, and while no turkey, it lacks the grip of say john frankenheimer's 'the manchurian candidate' or alan j.pakula's 'the parallax view'. being a left-wing conspiracy movie, it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it. i prefer right-wing ones myself - they are funnier! 'domino' has the look and feel of a made-for-t.v. movie, and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the michael caine classic 'get carter'.what makes it watchable are gene hackman and richard widmark. the latter, who sadly passed away earlier this year, is superb as the mysterious tagge, who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated, beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall - just like dominoes. as tucker, the innocent pawn, hackman is marvellous. you have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place. in his shoes, i'd have fled to the other side of the world, anywhere to get away from these fanatics. hackman's love scenes with bergen slow the plot down, and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched. presumably the producers thought so too, which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film's entire premise - voiced by british actor patrick allen - warning the audience that 'they' are out there, and that 'they' are out to get us. comedian les dawson later spoofed this opening in his b.b.c. show 'the dawson watch'.mickey rooney had earlier worked with kramer on 'its a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world'. his 'death' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture, with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead.conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left, but now the right are getting in on the act too. last year, 'taking liberties', an absurd concoction of lies and half-truths about tony blair's government turned out to be britain's answer to 'reefer madness'. at least, 'domino' had lovely candice bergen. the best chris atkins' film could offer was anne widdecombe!surprisingly, 'the domino principle' was made by sir lew grade, the legendary british television mogul behind 'the saint', 'jesus of nazareth' and 'the muppet show'. he worked with adam kennedy again in 1980 on 'raise the titanic!', whose failure was so great it sank grade's ambitions of being the new louis b.meyer. being somewhat open-minded, i would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.

the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie. this is a great movie. there is no special agency involved in the plot. this is the clue! this is a private plot, built as a private enterprise. this is a self-destructive and a self organized plot. as a conclusion, the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private, self organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money. all can be done just by delegation. the "director" must be just trigger. if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie, a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered. all the actors' performances are well done , with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney.

i loved dedee pfeiffer (is that spelled right?) in cybil. haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her. i thought she did a great job in this. the supporting cast was pretty good too. in some angles, the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman. the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists. the young boyfriend was a hottie. i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure.just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies. kept my interest and i'll watch it again when they rerun it. can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this? you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want. thanks in advance. aboutagirly.

i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones. the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didn't see coming before each commercial. to me it was kind of like medium meets csi.did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman? are they related in any way? i'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video.dedee was great. haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly.if you're into to tv mystery movies, check this one out if you have a chance.

though the story is essentially routine, and the "surprise" ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine, and shine they do. the film is impeccably made - for its time. it was remade in 2000 as "under suspicion" and if you only want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), i recommend the latter one, with hopkins' up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at. the ending, however, still blows. (**1/2)

garde à vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains. if you're not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, don't even try to watch it. you'll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you.garde à vue is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by audiard by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.why does maître martineau (serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation. his wife knows it, she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in france, there was still death penalty)rather than unveiling the sole "pure and innocent" aspect of his pitiful life.

what keeps us going - or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed. without spoiling so much, of course there is a red herring and a twist. but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping. when there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick, perverted pedophiliac that we're predisposed to have in mind. one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof. these problems of course are given their denouement in the film's shocking finale.this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear. they were heckling obviously because they aren't partial to "central location" films. although there is a bit of travelling, when we get to the woods and the beach. and we realize that gallien isn't as clever as we are made to think he is.the inquisitor is 5/5

police, investigations, murder, suspicion: we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore. most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers, to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere. however, most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones. yet, it occurs that these people may easily be misled. a film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years old...it is garde a vue, a unique movie by claude miller.is there much of the action? not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time. but the way they are executed is the movie's great plus. jerome charles martinaud (michel serrault) is being investigated by inspector gallien (lino ventura) and insector belmont (guy marchand). it's a new year's eve, a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting. yet, after the rape and murder of two children, at the dawn of the old year, the door of suspicion must be open at last. in other words, (more quoted from the movie), it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is. to achieve this, one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both parties...some people criticize the script for being too wordy. yet, i would ask them: what should an investigation be like if not many questions and, practically, much talk. this wordiness touches the very roots of the genre. in no way is this boring but throughout the entire film, it makes you, as a viewer, as an observer, involved. moreover, the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told. not too much and not too little of them - just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting. the most memorable flashbacks, for me, are when chantal (romy schneider), martinaud's wife, talks about one lovely christmas... but these flashbacks also contain the views of the places, including the infamous beach. it all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace. and since i saw garde a vue, i always mention this film as one of the "defenders" of french cinema against accusations of mess and chaos. but those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still won't find the content and its execution satisfactory. yet, garde a vue is worth seeing also for such people. why? for the sake of performances. but here don't expect me to praise foremost romy schneider. garde a vue is not romy schneider vehicle. she does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child. she credibly portrays a person who is calm, concrete, who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words. her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant, more credible than the overly melancholic role of elsa in la passante de sans souci. it is still acted. however, romy schneider does not have much time on screen. practically, she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits; she, as a wife and a different viewpoint, comes symbolically with the new year, at midnight. her role is a purely supporting one. who really rocks is lino ventura. he is the middle aged inspector antoine gallien who wants to find out the truth, who is aware that his questions are "missiles" towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate. he is an inspector who, having been married three times, is perfectly acknowledged of women's psyche. he is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service. finally, he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on new year's eve. michel serrault also does a fine job expressing fear, particularly in the final scenes of the movie. but thumbs up for mr ventura. brilliant!as far as memorable moments are concerned, this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed. the entire film is memorable, has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and, which i have not mentioned before, gorgeous music. for me, the talk of chantal and inspector gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment. you are there with the two characters, you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you see.garde a vue is a very interesting film, a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances. new year has turned and...is it now easier to open the door? you'll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by claude miller. 8/10

nothing revolutionary here; just impeccably elegant, restrained cinema.garde a vue is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station, and mostly to one interrogation room, but director claude miller (who made the wonderful film this sweet sickness, among others) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography. miller's restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of the consequently-pivotal interior mise-en-scene makes for captivating viewing.lino ventura is superb as usual, succeeding to legitimize a character that, on paper, is cliche: the laconic, hard-nosed, world-weary homicide detective. ventura lives the role, making it completely believable, even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time.michel serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic. the exchanges between the two are more-often-than-not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits. serrault's character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning, and pitiable; then later....the "message" of garde a vue, if one were to search for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to, if necessary, close cases at the expense of justice. for most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy.

i liked the movie a real lot. wanted to see it just for dara tomanovich, but the plot and story were ok too. a very cool change in plot when you least expect it.

there are other reviews here so i don't need to say how great it is or what it's about...my point is: i heard about this movie ages ago, before it was shown. i can't even remember how, i just know it was through the internet. the distributors went under before it ever hit! for months i moped and complained. please note that on this page there's a link to buy this film and the only highlighted area is vhs at amazon.com in germany. you can use alta vista's babelfish to translate. i know it's pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and there's a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning that's also been dubbed in german, but as hilarious and campy as this film is, it really only makes it funnier! if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions it's so worth it! it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the u.s. from germany. trust me, it might seem like a lot to spend on a film, but if you're into corny b-flicks you'll be blowing money left and right getting conversions for your friends!

emilio miraglio's "the red queen kills seven times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed. first of all, and of paramount importance for me, it has a complex, twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end. the story, concerning a series of gruesome murders (you already know how many from the film's title, right?) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, is an involving one, and the murderer, a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman, is both frightening and memorable. every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and, in one of her earlier roles, sybil danning, as a lustful tramp at barbara's fashion house. another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. gorgeous scenery? check again. filmed largely in wurzburg, germany, the picture is a treat for the eye indeed. ok, ok, but what about those murders? after all, isn't that what gialli are all about? well, i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out...not to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and lots of 'em, too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of ugo pagliai, a hunky leading man for the female viewers. as i said, a perfect giallo. and even better, this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame, and you know what that means: a gorgeous print and loads of extras, to boot! thanks, guys!

i have to say, seventeen & missing is much better than i expected. the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery.dedee pfeiffer is emilie, a mom who insists her daughter, lori (tegan moss), not attend a so-called graduation party one weeknight, but lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway. when lori does not come home, emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance.seventeen & missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type, as it is not so predictable. pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of it comes off as believable. this lmn original movie premiered last night. 10/10

we fans of ed wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place, but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan-dom that i have never before approached! one of the most intense thrills of non-mainstream movie adulation - at least as far as i am concerned - is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure. i remember how, as a teenager, i longed to see eddie's "revenge of the dead" (a.k.a. "night of the ghouls"), which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades. likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as doris wishman's "a night to dismember" or half the works of jesus franco! however, recent years have seen video and dvd rendering these once unfindable treasures almost too accessible - even for those of us on the 'wrong' (!) side of the atlantic....and then, behold, there was "i woke up early the day i died" - a movie that should have been so 'big', yet which disappeared into the ether even before fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite. the 1990s needed a hard-to-find movie though which would really be worth hunting out: and this, to be sure is it.... i don't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film - its classy-yet-kitsch cast, its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals, its wondrous moments of "pure cinema" (in the sense of the 1920s french cineastes) and surrealism, or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack - since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here.what i do wish to mention, briefly, is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost-lost-to-us-but-thankfully-not-quite movie! i think the german video, which i picked up while in cologne on a cold crisp winter's day, is fairly well-known to ed wood's followers now. it is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released. however, there is thankfully more to be found!!! firstly, there are a number of reviews available from the film's german theatrical release - i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to "woodify" my students..... some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film's artistry and entertainment value - and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the american trash and european arthouse traditions. secondly, there is the score by larry groupe', which can be acquired from the man himself - many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener, particularly if you are contemplating the film's currently "vaulted" status and growing a little melancholy at the same time. finally - for now - i wish to mention the promo soundtrack that cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers. beg, borrow, steal, kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these!!!!!! it features 14 tracks from the film, including eartha kitt's ballad, the late darcy clay's "jesus i was evil" (two versions of which are also available on cd from new zealand, although that is another story again!), the cool radio music to which christina ricci dances, and also those amazing techno drops by minty and zhv (the latter being billy z's very own techno band).....become obsessed - let ed wood rule your life.

this 1998 film was based on a script by the late edward d. wood, a script that featured no dialogue in the tradition of films such as the thief. while much of wood's work was quirky low-budget entries into various genre-film traditions, his first released feature glen or glenda was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant-garde techniques. i woke up early the day i died represents that side of ed wood, the experimenter, although this film is a comedy (a nightmarish comedy, however!), while the cross-dressing theme of glen or glenda was taken so seriously by wood that there was not room for comedy there. from the first few seconds of this film i knew that i was being taken to a new cinematic world, and i can't really compare that world with anything else. the technical side of the film--production design, sound design, music scoring, photography, etc.--is groundbreaking on any number of levels. in particular, although the film has no "dialogue" there is sound of all kinds and also "language", but you'll have to see how it's done yourself, as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout. the glen or glenda-esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum. the whole film is played at a hysterical fever-pitch, and billy zane provides an amazing tour-de-force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is. in a just world, he would have been given some award for this performance. he even looks like ed wood, and as played by zane this character is at various timesfunny, sleazy, tragic, sympathetic, and anonymous(sometimes simultaneously!!!). what a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a north american theatrical or video release, only playing a few festivals. right now, it's only available on video in germany (in fact, my copy is from a german source--the excerpts from wood's screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german, although the newspaper headlines (that great low-budget technique of giving plot elements, especially those that would be too expensive to film, via newspaper headlines is used here in the wood tradition)that zane sees are in english). i think that this film could have gotten a word-of-mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion. and if played off city by city slowing on the art-film circuit, it could have done well. in fact, if the legal issues can be resolved, i'd like to suggest that the film should still be given a theatrical release, especially a midnight "cult" release. this is a classic waiting to be discovered.did i "understand" every scene? no, but i "felt" every scene emotionally. did everything "work" in the film? perhaps not. i've only seen it twice, and the first time i saw it i was interruped a number of times. however, with all the assembly-line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much "alternative" film being fetishistic or pretentious shot-on-video film-school rejects, we need actual hollywood-made experimentation like this. the recent bob dylan film "masked and anonymous" took similar chances as did something like steven soderbergh's full frontal. this film could find an audience much larger than either of those. if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing, see if it has ever been released on video. you will not be bored. invite some friends over...make it a party. play the amazing soundtrack loud. i have a feeling that, wherever he is in the afterlife, ed wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film. wood's probably also laughing that, just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life, the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making.

ok, so i know of this movie because of a friend of mine's in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming, so from a personal stand-point, i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem. if you dig at all on info regarding this movie, you'll find it's mired in legal troubles (even over 7 years after being filmed) so, if you are at all like me -- then you'll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy. my source? ebay. about $15 but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail, it was a very rough, grainy copy of a "screener only" release, complete with annoying top mini time-code but alas, i could still enjoy it but not as much as if i had a proper copy, something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you. from what i have gleaned, it's been released on dvd in germany & now spain. with that, good luck & happy searching/bidding...;). the score/sndtrk is worth it alone. very eclectic and varied (somethinbg rare these days imho in film) -- i think that will be my next sndtrk/score to locate, but i digress... now, onto the review. the film opens as billy zane's character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in. he steals her clothes (even shoes) and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bank/loan shop but after escaping with the loot, well, i guess this is where the "plot" begins -- he inadvertently looses it. after perpetrating several campy over-the-top crimes & dalliances to various a to c-list celebs to locate the money, he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral -- i think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan office/bank, and -- even with 1950's police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout -- he never gets seen or nabbed. (he sees daily newspapers reporting his "crimes") this i liked, because it gave the thin plot an extension. after all, it's a movie (see: fiction) & director iris iliopulos does what i think is everything possible to 1) bring wood's vision to fruition and 2) give it an updated feel, yet have shots of authentic 50's police cars intertwined with, ahh, local l.a..99$ stores -- so well hence my 9 rating. if the period and props were authentic -- i would have given it a 10. now it wraps it self up kinda weird and i won't spoil it for anyone but let's just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it, to me, it had promise, action and comedy -- all up till the end, so...with all that said --locate a copy at your own discretion.just realize that, as there is no dialouge (except for some narration and singing) this may be up your alley -- maybe not-- but i definitely think it's worth a watch. the actors all do fine performances and it's only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction -- then i would say by all means check this film out for it's not like anything these studios put out these days (or will in the future, too) i am sure.

i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the "so bad it's good" type of viewing. however, i really like this film for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation.the whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic, but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements. billy zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars.you may not like this film, you may not enjoy it, but if you get the chance to watch it, then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face, and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars. highly reccomended.

i've been disappointed, if not surprised, at the lack of appreciation this film has received. once again, billy zane proves he's more than just a hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos. calling this a silent film is inaccurate, as there's a lot of music and sound. it has a manic pace and is full of the goofy inventiveness that ed wood is finally beginning to be appreciated for. look at the cast listing, and realize that everyone shines. no one is there just to show their face. i believe they're all in the movie to show their appreciation of wood, and to do a broad, physical kind of acting not seen much these days.but, today, reviewers try to guess what's going to become a hit much more than they show any kind of esthetic appreciation for a movie. and iwuetdid has no discernable target audience. it was made mostly out of love for wood's script. even after his death, the trendy social parasites have dealt him another serious blow, and deprived the world of a minor classic. this is a highly entertaining and a genuinely experimental film that really deserves to live, at least on dvd.

this is a script that ed wood worked over 10 years on trying to get made. aris iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other, more transitory valuables.this is a dialogue-free movie, that some may foolishly describe as silent. in fact, it is a quite noisy film, without the inane chatter of most flicks. in the hands of these filmmakers, the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the hollywood script mill, particularly that stupid boat movie billy zane last was in ('watch out!', 'oh no!' - j. cameron.... ick...) i'll take zane's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film over empty dialogue any day.billy zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film. ricci is radiant as always, and the gods are shining when you can put sandra bernhard, rick(y) schroeder, eartha kitt and andrew mccarthy's name on the same poster.the design is perfect, the pyramid set exquisite, and ron perlman's beastly performance is simply wonderful. overall, this is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of ed wood jr., auteur and cinenephile. a must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate iliopulos and his cast obviously do. a film to make you wish you had made it yourself.

i saw this film at the international film festival of brussels. i also met the director of the film. i heard that ed wood wrote the story in 10 years! i'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece - his triumph.well, if you take the film seriously (like mr. wood did) it is really one of the worst films you will ever see. and this is cool. the big joke of i woke up early the day i died is that it doesn't even try to be a decent film.this makes the film very, very good. the script is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humour. billy zane's role is absolutely excellent. you see, this is either high art...or low rubbish.****/*****

cor blimey. this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece. billy zane is stunning as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy.the soundtrack is really good, and the set pieces are a joy to behold. i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates, a few bottles of your liquor of choice, and prepare to be astonished and highly entertained.this carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan 9 from outer space that it is in the true "b" movie tradition. but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. ron pearlman for example. i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. all a bit mad, and all the better for it.

it's all about mitzi. i loved her in this. and didn't she look fantastic?! i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies. this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times. the richard character was completely creepy. i've dated guys like that. well, not totally like that lol. i wish zack hadn't have gotten killed. he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes. i love these stalker type stories. it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked. my husband doesn't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it. i can't wait to see what mitzi does next!

loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager.the movie, was presented well, with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing. many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter. the progression of situations were cleverly written,making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious. too bad there have to be commercials.i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again.i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue. husband and wife heated discussions(or should i say fights?) were very realistic.the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not.i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film. thank you! looking forward to the next films---when? whidbey

it's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does. she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. that notwithstanding, yes, the plot was predictable. i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was, which would have added more to the suspense. it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a bit more back story. i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie. i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack's death and possibly closure with her husband. i do have to say though, i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there. it was a very fitting end for richard. of course, mitzi rocked! i am so looking forward to her future projects.

i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because, frankly, i love the guy, even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie (long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick). it's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot (but then most movies these days aren't exactly original), but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband, martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter, and mitzi kapture does a good job, if that was her goal, of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like. nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. however, too much of the plot takes place off-screen -- like motivation, prior behaviors, good times and bad times -- and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience (i.e., me). the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "but what about..." category, and overall, i can't say that i cared much about any of the characters. that being said, it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and i still like nick.

this film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter martha macissac (olivia dunne) was very much in love with joe macleod,(zack). the mother is played by mitzi kapture,(jill dunne) who suddenly walks in on her daughter and zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface. jill dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often. there are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter olivia dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs. in many ways, olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and nick mancuso,(richard grant) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner. this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror. enjoy

and here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror. emilio miraglia's "the red queen kills seven times" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences. it's a fabulous giallo (released in the golden year 1972) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of italian cinema. the storyline doesn't just introduce your average black-gloved & sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous "red queen". at young age, their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who, once every 100 years on april 6th, kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim. fourteen years later, kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins. sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the states recently... or has she? complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. her face can never be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim. she's not exactly gentle either, as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger, dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences! that latter one is truly one of the greatest (= most gruesome) acts of violence i've ever seen! what more could you possibly request? some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning. emilio miraglia isn't the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended "the night evelyn came out of the grave", but his influence and importance should not be forgotten.

recap: zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with thierry. thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way. he has submerged himself in work, laid of his writing, and zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them. into this enters johnny, and old friend of thierry's who once were artists in exile together. but johnny has kept on painting, and just have a day job for the rent. he takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny. there is an instant raw attraction between zandalee and johnny, and they enter into an affair. but zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband. but none of them, not zandalee, not johnny and not thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control.comments: it is set as a thriller. but maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death, and threat of violence. not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different angle. and it is not really until the second half in zandalee until the thriller emerges, and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half, i can't really describe the genre as a thriller then. much more of a romantic drama than anything else, but with the underlying currents of other genres. the developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind. because that is what it is all about, what drives the characters and therefore the entire story. desire. the need to have, and the need to be.in my opinion it is quite good, definitely a lot better than its current (4.1) rating anyway. it takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense, and it handles the erotic part very well, with taste. it is always an integral part of the story, needed to be there to give the story it's needed weight, and i never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that. but unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end, and the end itself feels kind of flat, even if in its own way kind of dramatic.the cast is impressive, spearheaded by known actors like nicholas cage and judge reinhold. but the show is almost completely stolen by erika anderson. beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire, she excels were both cage and reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough. her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in zandalee, i can only hope it is because of her own choices. also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie, it is steve buscemi and joe pantoliano.when you're in the right mood this is a very good movie, it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves.7/10

bored and unhappy young babe zandalee (a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout erika anderson) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent, yet dull businessman thierry martin (a solid and credible portrayal by judge reinhold). zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist johnny collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by nicolas cage). can the relationship between thierry and zandalee be salvaged? or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? director sam pillsbury and screenwriter mari kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. the dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: "i wanna shake you naked and eat you alive"). better still, this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (johnny and zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight). the tart'n'tangy new orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings. with his long, scruffy black hair, greasy mustache, foul mouth, and coarse manners, cage's johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing "romantic" lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid. the cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: anderson, cage and reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from joe pantoliano as zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend gerri, viveca lindfors as theirry's wise, perceptive mother tatta, aaron neville as friendly bartender jack, and steve buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief. walt lloyd's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look. the flavorsome, harmonic score by pray for rain likewise hits the spot. a delightfully campy and seamy riot.

there are some films that every horror fan owes himself (or herself) to see, and emilio miraglia's "la dama rossa uccide sette volte" aka. "the red queen kills seven times" (1972) is definitely one of them. with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite sub-genres in horror, i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while, and even though my expectations were high, this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes. miraglia's earlier giallo, "the night evelyn came out of the grave" (1971) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror, but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite. "the red queen kills seven times" is, hands down, one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made, and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it. an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements, "the red queen" delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: an inventive and incredibly compelling plot, spine-chilling suspense, a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, eerily lush colors, stylish murders, a brilliant score, and, not least, a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror.the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany. as little girls, kitty wildenbrück and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting: legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people. fourteen years later, kitty (barbara bouchet) has become a successful fashion photographer. suddenly, people begin to get murdered... director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style, atmosphere and colorful creepiness with "the night evelyn came out of the grave" and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem. "the red queen kills seven times" is a feast for the eyes indeed, and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plot-wise. the haunting painting in the grandfather's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps. the red lady (or red queen, as she is called in the english title) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo, the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own. a sexy female cast is always appreciated, especially in a giallo, and this one is a prime example for that. the ravishing barbara bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen, and she is a great actress too. bouchet's presence has graded up many italian flicks, among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cult-masterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year (1972): fernando di leo's "milano calibro 9", lucio fulci's giallo-highlight "don't torture a duckling" and this unforgettable gem. apart from the wonderful miss bouchet, the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning, marina malfatti ("the night evelyn came out of the grave"), and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera. as the whole film, the murders are stylish and extremely elegant, yet frightening and macabre, and some of them are quite gory. bruno nicolai's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets, and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting. the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings, the tension-level increses with each passing minute. "the red queen..." begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second. overall, this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for. "the red queen kills seven times" is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made, and a top-priority for every fan of horror and/or italian cinema to see. 10/10

an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold.people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed.kitty (barbara bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. is it franziska (marina malfatti)? is it evelyn back from death for revenge? is it a plot to steal an inheritance? the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia, who only did one other giallo, as far as i know.the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out. someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty.

i'm feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the u.n.c.l.e.-verse. the year was 1972, and i.t.v. ran all eight features in one bumper run ( followed by re-runs of 'the persuaders' starring tony curtis and roger moore ) on saturday evenings. 'the karate killers' was chosen to open the season. it commenced with a cool action sequence as solo and kuryakin's sports car got attacked by a squadron of thrush mini-copters. i was a fan for life from that moment on.after the main credits ( nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage ) we go to the laboratory of dr.simon true ( jim boles ), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater. true's wife amanda ( joan crawford ) has been having an affair with thrush agent randolph ( herbert lom ). a ruthless fellow indeed, he kills both the doctor and his wife, before hunting for the formula. true has prepared for the event - he has divided it into five segments, each written on a photograph of himself, and sent it to his five daughters, all of whom are scattered throughout the world.solo and kuryakin set out to get the formula first, leading to a string of episodes in different locations, and cameos from the likes of telly savalas ( as a tight-fisted italian count ), terry-thomas, and curt jurgens. one of dr.true's daughters - sandy ( kim darby ) - accompanies the u.n.c.l.e. boys on their global quest.having assembled the formula, thrush turns up and makes them hand it over, before whisking them off to their secret base at the north pole...of all the u.n.c.l.e. feature films, this is the one i feel should have been produced specially for the cinema. it hurts by being a television product, albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual. no location filming was done, and the various segments come across as repetitive, usually culminating in a scrap between u.n.c.l.e. and thrush. of the cast, joan crawford is memorably hammy in her small role, and curt jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy. as a london bobby, terry-thomas is as delightful as ever, and herbert lom good as the chief villain. kim darby grates though as 'sandy'. she should have been told to stay at home.what is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time, including 'in like flint', 'casino royale' and 'the ambushers'. i'd love to know how solo and company escaped from thrush h.q. after randolph's death though.

but it's worth watching for boyer, lorre and paxinou. greene's entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to american shores, as in this gun for hire, or the use of american actors in roles where they did not fit. bacall fits that part here. i kept waiting for her to whistle and bring bogie to life; her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class englishwoman. but listen to the dialogue! no, people don't talk that way except in books, but greene was sending a message about an england that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. one other positive note: greene's range of characters were kept whole. while mr. mukerjee resembled more a brahamin, at least his nationality was kept, and his final conversation with paxinou is priceless.

never realized that charles boyer, (luis denard) appeared with lauren bacall,(rose cullen) in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together. even peter lorre, (contreras) had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint. this story deals with a republican courier, luis denard who visits england during the spanish civil war and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations. lauren bacall, (rose cullen) comes to the aid of luis denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of english mine workers who threaten his life. the real bad guy in this film is victor francen, (licata) "beast with five fingers" who gives an outstanding performance. great classic 1945 film without humphrey bogart.

this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast, and many memorable scenes. the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents. the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman (boyer), a belgian (francen), a greek (paxinou) and a hungarian (lorre)! and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat! despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially those of paxinou and lorre. but the scene in which boyer, paxinou and lorre meet, and talk in wildly different accents, is a real hoot! and i guess, seeing as how they were alone, that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway! it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn't find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles! of course hollywood has often had an "any old accent will do" policy - my other favorite is greta garbo (swedish) as mata hari (dutch), who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican (ramon novarro). maybe they should have got novarro for "confidential agent" - he would have been great in boyer's role or at least in francen's (which would have saved greatly on the dark make-up budget).

a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war, when a spanish republican, sent by his soon to be overthrown government, (charles boyer) infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain. he upsets the locals, getting convincingly beaten in one scene, and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood. notwithstanding socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia, and world politics, this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre, and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe, and manages more than once to get under your skin.

bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. this one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: "to have and to have not" (1944) and "the big sleep" (1945), both of which paired her with humphrey bogart. granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own. i think there was some miscasting in having her portray a british upper-crust lady. no accent whatsoever. i think all the strange accents were distracting - boyer was certainly no spaniard. it was hard to keep straight which country people were from.i really liked the black and white cinematography. mood is used to great affect - i especially liked the fog scene. the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.bacall is just gorgeous. boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and bacall together was a little strange. not great chemistry - and certainly no bogie and bacall magic. but i still really liked this picture. there is great tension and it moves along well enough. i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film.katina paxinou and peter lorre stand out as supporting cast. paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. her one scene where she laughs maniacally as mr. muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing. lorre also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of conteras - a sleazy coward to the end. wanda bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). turns out she later married auie murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage.

charles boyer is supposed to be spanish, and he's come to london to buy coal in "confidential agent," a 1945 film also starring lauren bacall, katina paxinou, peter lorre, dan seymour, and wanda hendrix. boyer is luis denard, and everyone is out to stop him except bacall. his papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the fascists.this film has its good and not so good points. it rates high for atmosphere and for suspense, and it is highly entertaining. bacall is incredibly beautiful, boyer is passionate, paxinou is mean, lorre is slimy, hendrix appropriately pathetic, and seymour outrageously wonderful.the not so good points: bacall is supposed to be english, and boyer spanish. uh, no. boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent, but bacall is 100% american, not of the british upper class. the two have no chemistry. conclusion: bacall is somewhat miscast. her acting isn't up to snuff either; she's better in other films. but she's an astonishing looking woman, and much can be forgiven.paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. dan seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. it's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good. this was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. seymour wasn't a small actor.definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.

i watch a lot of films, good, bad and indifferent; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon, even if it is only set design, or the reliable labor of a good character actor, or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever.however, i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film, one i had never seen before. graham greene has been translated into film many times of course, in such masterpieces as "thin man" and in lesser vehicles. "confidential agent" is one of those lesser vehicles, yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway, despite lackluster direction, the incongruity of bacall and boyer's depictions as (respectively) british and spanish, and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads. in some ways, this last "problem" actually begins to work in the film's favor, for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person's tragedy? the most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from greene's complex and guilt-ridden psychology, which pervades the film. i know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull, and i can understand that. yet i found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world. i was compelled to watch, not by any great acting (although boyer is marvelous as usual, managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness, tragedy, hope, and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes), but by the down-spiraling rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money. what is a thief? what good is love in the face of death? where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin? the film does not rise to the level of art, and thus cannot hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than mere entertainment, and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn. the lack of glitz, of "bubble," of narrative "bounce" help to make this movie very worthwhile.and there is no happy ending, for history wrote the ending.

it could have been a better film. it does drag at points, and the central story shifts from boyer completing his mission to boyer avenging wanda hendrix's death, but graham greene is an author who is really hard to spoil. his stories are all morality tales, due to his own considerations of catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world view), and the human condition.boyer is luis denard, a well-known concert pianist, who has sided with the republicans in the spanish civil war. he has been sent to england to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed. unfortunately for denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the falagists of spain. in particular katina paxinou (mrs. melendez) a grim boarding house keeper, and peter lorre (mr. contreras) a teacher of an "esperanto" type international language. wanda hendrix is the drudge of a girl (else) who works for mrs. melendez. the local diplomat, licata (victor francken) is already a willing associate of the falangists.the brits (holmes herbert, miles mander, and best - if not worst - of the lot, george coulouris) don't give much hope to boyer's cause (which he soon grasps may be britain's before long). herbert and mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the ramsay macdonald's and stanley baldwin's governments during the civil war. coulouris here is a typical col. blimp type - always impeccable in his native english diction, he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general.the one ray of hope is lauren bacall (rose cullen), here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she can't really. she's an aristocrat - the daughter of a press lord. it was bacall's second film, and (sad to say) almost sank her long career. she does act well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with humphrey bogart and being directed by howard hawks. boyer is a fine actor, but he's not bogie, and herman shumlin is not hawks. her next film returned her to bogie and hawks again, and her star resumed it's ascendancy.it's a bleak film (as was the novel). boyer's mission never succeeds, as he has too many hidden foes all over the place. but the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives.with dan seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of katina paxinou (and the man who destroys her). it is well worth watching to catch the warner's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction.

the novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what greene wrote; for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with boyer and lorre, or the murdered-child obsession that takes over some of the plot. where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to the ludicrous.however i don't want to suggest that the film is bad in any way. it always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good 'un. some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to anything.it's a dreadful shame that the film's not available on dvd.

this film has scenes that come back to me at the strangest times -- that intense scene with mr. muckerji telling mrs melandez that someone he spoke with witnesses the girl being pushed out the window by a woman who fits her description ---is one that rolls around -- the way she keeps referring to him by name --- in a greek accent "mr muckerji" -- and then when boyer discovers her having just taken poison and gives her one last smack up the side of the head before she dies --- its a delight! "fools -- fools -- all my life"...etc etc -- you get the point..i have to buy this one. i love dan seymour's acting -- he usually plays some plump foreign sultan or police chief and appeared in casablanca and many great pictures.

it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience. shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art.it is, however, a beautiful movie. i have loved it since local channels used to show it. graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (many love "the fallen idol" but i am not among them. i think i saw "brighton rock" once many years ago and liked it but maybe i'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.) this is superbly cast. charles boyer does not, it's true, come across as spanish. but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character -- tired, wary, caring. lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him. but the supporting players are the best: katina paxinou is excellent. her performance is a little grand guignol, but i attribute that to the director. peter lorre, whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto-like universal language, is excellent -- as always.and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart. she comes across as a precocious early teenager. the character wants to be helpful. she does her best.i recommend this movie highly. not without reservations. the reservation is, primarily, that it is a little stolid. but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.

while this is a faithful adaptation, it is much less exciting than greene's novel. also, it's a bit ridiculous when people say things to boyer like, "you're spanish, aren't you?"still, the movie's not at all bad, just slow-moving.

good old black and white graham greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things. hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop that's being minted by hollywood today. bacall lights up the screen of course and boyer is entirely engaging. they don't make movies like this any more.

an underrated addition to the graham greene cinematic canon - its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues. director shumlin, theatrical director, frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease. both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! in a 40s thriller!), the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous (and possibly paedophiliac), brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the spanish civil war into jolting dangerous reality, has one horrific murder, an astonishing insights into class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of greene's god, and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history.

once upon a time in a castle...... two little girls are playing in the garden's castle. they are sisters. a blonde little girl (kitty) and a brunette one (evelyn). evelyn steals kitty's doll. kitty pursues evelyn. running through long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting on an armchair, reads the newspaper. kitty complains about evelyn, while evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. evelyn begins to say repeatedly: "i am the red lady and kitty is the black lady". suddenly evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs kitty's doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head. a fight ensues. and evelyn almost uses the dagger against kitty. the grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided.later on, their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red:"a long time ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. they were sisters and hated each other. one night, for jealousy reasons, the black lady entered the red lady's room and stabbed her seven times. one year later, the red lady left her grave. she killed six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black lady. once every hundred years, the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself."the grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend, sixteen years from now, the red queen should come again and kill seven times. but he assures them that this is just an old legend.sixteen years pass.....this is the very beginning of the film. there are many twists and surprises in the film. it's better for you to forget about logic (if you really analyse it, the story doesn't make sense) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors, the gorgeous women, the clothes, the tasteful decor, the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack.enjoy barbara bouchet, sybil danning, marina malfatti, pia giancaro, among other goddesses. there's a nude by sybil danning lying on a sofa that's something to dream about. and don't forget: the lady in red kills seven times!if you've liked "la dama rossa..." check out also "la notte che evelyn uscì dalla tomba".

by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet. the movie never, and i do mean never, lets up in action. it may be mild action but it's action. once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. the explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were feasible, and the fighting was incredible. matt damon will forever be jason bourne.all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception. the action, the stakes, the plot. how they do it i will never know. i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies. because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie, we wouldn't have this one to talk about.so don't go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you!

last christmas, i was lucky enough to receive one of the 1200 ultimate bourne boxed sets from my better half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday. given how many recent trilogies have stumbled over the finishing line instead of striding triumphantly through it, i was somewhat wary of approaching "the bourne ultimatum" but i really shouldn't have been worried. the electric actions sequences and bruising fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story-lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers i can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series.jason bourne (matt damon) returns after an apparent leak about operation blackbriar - a new program based on the old treadstone project - to the journalist simon ross (paddy considine) at the guardian. determined to uncover more about his half-remembered past, bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the cia including deputy director noah vosen (david strathairn) believe that bourne himself is the leak and start to pursue the rogue agent with renewed vigour. can bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good? personally, i felt slightly disappointed with "the bourne supremacy" as it ditched the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film. not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic "bourne identity", it seemed more like a slow-burning spy novel rather than an action-thriller. no such worries here - every car crash, punch, kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully, it still retains a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around. it also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films, providing a suitable bookend to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed. performances throughout are nearly faultless - even julia styles begins to offer something more than book-wormy eye-candy. the only real downer is that this, like the other bourne films, has little to do with the original novel but unless you're a die-hard ludlum fan, this isn't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre.nothing pleases me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears, "the bourne ultimtum" is a cracking movie filled with enough bone-crunching action to satisfy the meat-heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute. even at the final reel, you're never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not (and if not, what more do you want?), this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can. no wonder this series forced the producers of the bond movies to throw out forty-odd years of movie history in order to start again. bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent bond films look more like austin powers in comparison until "casino royale" gave the bond series the reboot it desperately needed. missing out of the jason bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition - go and get yourself a copy of the dvd. not the ultimate bourne collection though - limited edition, i'm afraid!

i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow! i had already seen the first two films and i liked them, but ultimatum, i loved.matt damon plays jason bourne, a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run, trying to discover who he is.like i already said, i loved this movie from start to finish, no plot holes, slow scenes, everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films, but in all senses it was much better.best stunts, car chases, actors, and effects i've seen in an action movie all summer, (surprisingly due to spider-man 3, pirates, etc.) but i it wasn't just action in this film, jason doesn't just kill and run. he has a soul and the audience feels for him, so drama is included. but that doesn't slow it down.of all the "threequels" that came out last summer, this was the best.

"perhaps we can arrange a meet. " "where are you now? " "i'm sitting in my office. " "i doubt that. " "why would you doubt that? " "if you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face. "bourne remains street tough, and elusive. only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy. conversation is macho, to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour. its all about the action.the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well. a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to great effect. there is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.if the shaky cam doesn't annoy you too much, enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going.

this movie was excellent. i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did. like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced, realistic and intense. if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also. the movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic. ok, julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far-fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in "treadstone" that bourne knows, that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction. the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them. the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them. they never treat the audience like idiots.all the actors were solid in their performances. i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen reprising her role from supremacy, david strathairn and scott glenn. i recommend this film and the trilogy. i do miss franka potente though.

the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy jason bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is "universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.first, i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to ultimatum. there may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like i was. you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy. jason bourne is played very well by mattdamon. damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.i won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. however, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3. it's the best action movie i've seen since live free or die hard.good) damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie bad) story is like many others

having not seen the films before (and not being able to stand matt damon), i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies. however, i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable. fast fight scenes, crazy motorbike chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in tbu. the near-misses between the cia and bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained.nevertheless, several things really grated my cheese.firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of bourne, cia, bourne, cia, bourne, cia. this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia, i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne. he crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something! very unrealistic.and secondly (inevitably) - the shaky camera. it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. we were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. fair enough if greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation, but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently!but all in all tbu is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. but i didn't think it was the best film of the year, despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.8/10.

picking up right after the moscow-showdown of supremacy, this is bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax. throughout the tight, 115-min-runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid, paris, marocco and ultimately new york. damon is every inch of the hard-trained killer robert ludlum imagined, he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now, and it's the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable, and it's exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar-opposites of himself that's so breathtaking. in this third, bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it, ultimatum delivers such an high-octane performance that you'll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull-offs; just look out for two great car-chases and a fight-scene as realistic as bond vs. shaw back in '63. director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get; a true pay-off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy-thriller standard.

this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization. in reality, perhaps they are. after all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne.matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. he is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. he gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.there is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less hollywood than many pictures. these sequences add realism to the film in feeling.the suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off. this is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & i am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.

the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. it is a political film more than a plain entertainment. jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed some one who became his corpse. but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people. who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980, when he became vice president? that goes along with what is being said on the internet. then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation. a woman and the senate; read my lips. in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the cinema. right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate. so go and watch the film. it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for, but no one is able to pretend it won't come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines

the third and last part of the bourne trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.the director and star (damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. how they got around that? the action scenes, for once, but they did another thing too, which i can't reveal, because that would be a spoiler. but if you watch the movie, than you'll notice it! funnily enough i read, that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)

he now has a name, an identity, some memories and a a lost girlfriend. all he wanted was to disappear, but still, they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built. now he wants some explanation, and to get ride of the people how made him what he is. yeah, jason bourne is back, and this time, he 's here with a vengeance.ok, this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world, but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. of course, like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's, "the bourne suprematy" is a super-heroes story. jason bourne is a captain-america project-like, who's gone completely wrong. in the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one. he now fights against what he considers like evil, after a person close to him has been killed (his girlfriend in "suprematy") by them. that's all a part of the super-hero story, including a character with (realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible) super powers.and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world (there's no frontiers in the bourne's movies, characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of "24", an american enemy, who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him. funny how "mad patriots" are now the n.1 enemies of paranoiac hollywood's stories.beside all those interesting thematics, the movie isn't flawless : the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes. but all that doesn't really matter, for "the bourne ultimatum" is an action movie. and the action scenes are rather impressive.everyone here is talking about the "waterloo scene" and the "tanger pursuit" and everyone's right. i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger, that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark. visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on american's contemporary thematics : "the bourne ultimatum" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick.

i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater. i'd been waiting for this since before they started filming. i wasn't disappointed.minor spoilers below- overall it was good, but it also lacked the continuity of the first two. identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama. this movie felt choppy at times. the plot-building down-times were slightly too drawn out. that caused the following action to feel too frenetic.camera: speaking of frenetic, the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me. i know its has been talked/whined about to nausea on the message board, but it doesn't mean it's not relevant. all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted. the ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie. it is a cheap, student director trick to make the film feel unsettled. i'd expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids, but not in this classy, adult, action series. too much extreme close-up also. do some framing. get some interesting shots. constant close-up feels like lazy directing to me.story: the story was very confusing at first. they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go. gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know you've missed some crucial information. felt rushed or compressed for time reasons. after you catch up however the story is quite good. it's enjoyable following leads along with bourne. however, i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy (landy/bourne on the phone) being in the middle of ultimatum thing. it basically makes the movie a half-prequel. i thought that was awkward.cast/characters: the star of the movie is the action. obviously there are only two originals left. bourne and nicky parsons. them teaming up was kind of odd to me. i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and confide in. unless i completely missed something, they never even tell you why they teamed up. the other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet. this felt like gilroy/greengrass/whoever wanting to not leave open ends. understandable but disappointing. seriously, damon with clive owen in identity and marton csokas in supremacy.. those scenes were phenomenal. these assassins are as uninteresting as castel (the first fella bourne fights in identity). the cast in general has degraded as the the series went on. clive owen was practically an afterthought. that's a measure of strength for that first cast. the second, they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen.... not exactly equal. this one trades brian cox and franka potente for 3 actors to be named later. nothing against david strathairn, scott glenn, or albert finney, but they're not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series. aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long, the acting was right on.as a whole, it was successful. felt like they wanted to get the series over with though. if they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts, eliminated scott glenn's part entirely, zoomed out, and taken the camera away from the seizure victim, it would have been perfect.ending spoileri don't see why they leave bourne alive at the end. it was my understanding this was the conclusion. they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless. i thought that was going to be it. a full circle type of ending. i did like nicky reacting to the news report though.spoiler specifics warning - quote from movie below -bourne's last line at the end "look at this.. look at what they make you give." quoting the first assassin he killed, i loved that. the final scene was great. (except that it was vosen {strathairn} that shot at bourne. why would he do that? just out for vengeance? if he was angry enough to murder, why not shoot pamela landy after she faxes his top secret file? that didn't make sense.)

the bourne ultimatum - jason bourne (matt damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia's latest program "blackbriar" to make super assassins like himself.i was so psyched for this one that i watched it's predecessors yesterday and today. identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops, slight lacking in action and suspense.hoo boy, does ultimatum have suspense! even when you know bourne will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it. it's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those $150 million giant robots did in transformers.chalk it up to paul greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy, as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring, with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (i'll never look at those the same way again) and an electric fan (don't ask). the music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over.the acting is good, and the evolution of julia stiles' character "nicky" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. this longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in supremacy, but just works better in ultimatum (better script). i am reminded of a scene in "goldeneye" (the only good pierce brosnan bond film) in which sean bean's character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed. bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources. albeit, resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything.sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia, interpol, and the police nearly anywhere he goes, that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports. sunglasses maybe? if you have a pulse and love action movies, than bourne ultimatum is for you. hell, it's probably the best action film to come out this year. of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. it kind of drags a touch near the end, but i almost feel tempted to overlook that. this is the first "3" movie this summer to at least match, if not exceed, the original and that is saying something.a-

im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you. this movie is awesome. from beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. the fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it. damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. he is this role. a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne. this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad. excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.p.s. the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action, but i still think we could do without it. the good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action.

first and foremost, speaking as no fan of the genre, "the bourne ultimatum" is a breathtaking, virtuoso, superb action movie.secondly, it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super-hero stuff.thirdly, the film carries a complex, important point, about crime-fighters turning into criminals themselves. no reference is made to abu ghraib or the executive branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights, none is necessary.so, the latest in the "bourne" series, in the hands of paul greengrass (of the 2004 "bourne supremacy" and last year's "united 93"), is a significant achievement, perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre."breathtaking" above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer seemingly holds his breath, pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless, globe-trotting, utterly suspenseful action. there is no letup, no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes.oliver wood's in-your-face cinematography is making the best of tony gilroy's screenplay from robert ludlum's 1990 novel (which doesn't stack up well against the "bourne identity," written a decade earlier).matt damon is once again the inevitable, irreplaceable bourne, the deadliest of fantasy cia agents, this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity, his past, and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine. nothing like his quietly heroic edward r. murrow, the always-marvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official, pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal "take-no-prisoners" policies and brutal procedures.joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairn's bad one. and, there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bourne's aid; a combination of greengrass' direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character, her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue.so good is "the bourne ultimatum" that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit, this time stretched to ridiculous excesses, as bourne defies constraints of geography, time, gravity... and physics in general. (can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? why not - it looks great.) all this "real-world" magic - leaping from country to country in seconds, to arrive at some unknown location exactly as, when, and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities. and yet, only a clueless pedant would allow "facts" interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the bourne fantasy.

the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. it goes further to play the anti-bond theme. bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.the film starts out in a flurry as bourne is running from the moscow police. the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. or does it? the time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things. a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. they aren't his target. from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, noah vosen, who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs. pamela landy is back as well as nicky parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well.the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney. it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.

i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy. please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. just leave it alone. right..moving on.as talented and versatile as matt damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne.if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. it sticks to what works and adds a little more. i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'identity' and 'supremacy' all mesh in 'ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of jason bourne's troubled past. the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more exciting for me.if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first. this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world. this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. i'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think 'ultimatum' might, just might, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.

having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies, i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatum.however it was a very thrilling experience and i didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the interval! i don't think i have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film. since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne. i've heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.the stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. well done.

"the bourne ultimatum" begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as jason bourne (matt damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the cia black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. a devastatingly icy david strathairn as the "man behind the curtain" is added to the returning cast of regulars including joan allen (excellent) and julia stiles (non-existent).like the second entry in the series, i wished paul greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. however, that being said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but i'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there.with the absence of the emotive and involving franka potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the "identity" and the "supremacy", this "ultimatum" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about bourne's past. it's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.

paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last! i've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project. all i have to say to that is...are you kidding me? come on it was not that bad at all. i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. as for the rest of the movie i really didn't even notice it.you can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne. sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. he really becomes jason bourne in this installment. damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen, ezra kramer, and julia stiles. david strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret cia organization.even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. this film stands far above the other two bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!

when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i didn't think much of it. at the time i was eleven years old, so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers. over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing, many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies. until two months ago i couldn't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum, i really had no intentions of watching it. but then i decided to go back and re-watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions. so i went out and bought both the original movies. and what a surprise it was to me when i was gripped by them. identity i found the superior of the two, but supremacy isn't far behind. they're both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them. because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum. and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint! matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies, i'd seen him in the talented mr ripley, but i never thought much of him in general. however, it appears he was born to play bourne (pardon the pun). throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see matt damon at his very best, even better than he was in the departed and i thought he was one of the best things in the departed. you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable. the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding. joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy, here she excels herself. her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie. julia stiles turns up again as nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character. julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets. david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen, he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. he's definitely the nastiest character we've met, and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty. strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, i will not say anything about the character, that's best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline. this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie. as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts. that very final scene in supremacy, in new york, a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time. won't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum. unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences. this is the part where i should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline, but i'd be lying if i didn't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases. the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time. well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series. in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in moscow. so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups, all very violent and shockingly brutal. a bike chase that is absolutely amazing, many foot chases which are even more amazing, a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable, and oh so much more! but the highlight for me has to be the scene in waterloo station, won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped.so any flaws for the movie? in my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you. the movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top. the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that. while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal.

i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me. most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window. with that said, the bourne series has been fantastic. doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly. this is not the sci-fi absurdity that was bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less). there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out. with director paul greengrass taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair. the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment, the bourne ultimatum. in what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy, the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.once again, bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses. someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story, he is assumed to be the mole. only pamela landy, she who was on the case to find him in supremacy, knows that he can't be the one. bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace. it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them. what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer. the film, then, becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends, or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series, with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story, it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression. this is not a detriment at all, however, as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot. admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight, between bourne and the cia's second asset, alone. the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own, but when they finally meet up, we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see. also, rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films, we instead get around three small scale road races, just as intense, but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.after five years of waiting, we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling. by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him. no one could have done it better than matt damon. he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences, but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him. joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job, but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox's character, from the first two films, took matters into his own hands. needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from david strathairn. like cox, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision. with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country, you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing. even the little guys do a wonderful job, like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything, albert finney as a man from bourne's past and possibly key to his origin, and edgar ramirez as one of the cia's operatives sent to take bourne out. ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen (identity), karl urban, and martin csokas (supremacy). he doesn't talk much, if at all, but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino.in the end, one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them. his skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott, but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts. rather than feel like over- production, his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action. let's also credit cinematographer oliver wood, who shot all three bourne films. he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them.

this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've given any movie. what made this movie so good for me? constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. finally, i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).i liked the first two bourne movies, but i loved this one.warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!

jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done. meanwhile, a cia chief in nyc outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.this shot effectively captures the mood of the film. as well as portraying bourne's quest to find out how he became jason bourne, ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.it is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. it's just so intense. bourne says to simon ross (considine) "this isn't some newspaper story, this is real" and in the audience you almost believe him. the camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. the action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing.the pacing is just incredible. it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. while they're often simple (the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it.with its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. ultimatum is its peak.

the bourne ultimatum (2007) review: after a thrilling set of two, we get the final installment. here's my take:the bourne ultimatum has it all. we have jason bourne(matt damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything. he has been running for too long. this time, it ends.the bourne ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer. matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date. he has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense. the reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way) or cheering on. (or both) i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping. the audience was loving it.the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package. all of the goods and then some. this is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.the last word: excellent conclusion. the best of the trilogy. this is how summer movie thrillers should be done. i love the bourne trilogy.

i don't hand out ten star ratings easily. a movie really has to impress me, and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that. furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.from the moment that the opening title appeared, i knew we were in for a ride. paul greengrass has done it again. everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. however for me, that last one was never a problem. i think it adds to the suspense.i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd, simply because it is genius. it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and altogether, an unforgettable trilogy.

emilio miraglia's first giallo feature, the night evelyn came out of the grave, was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror - and this second film is even better! we've got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around, although miraglia doesn't lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight. miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around, and as a result it's the typical giallo labyrinth, with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes. this is a definite bonus for the film, however, as while it can get a little too confusing at times; there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie. the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. the legend revolves around a woman called 'the red queen' who, legend has it, returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people. a few years later, murders begin to occur...even though he only made two giallo's, miraglia does have his own set of tributes. it's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called 'evelyn'. he likes castles, gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood, but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film; and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle, and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes. the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off! the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave; it fits the film well. the ending is something of a turn-off, as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere, it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious. but even so, this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre!

this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.directed by emilio p. miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting "la notte che evelyn usci della tomba" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.this film is a german-italian coproduction, but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "horror house". at least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, "la dama rossa uccide sette volte" is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglia's above mentioned other thriller.

what a fun movie! if you're a giallo fan, red queen kills 7 times is a real winner. to begin with, it's hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo. both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life. the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy. one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start. the killer, the red queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers i've seen in an italian movie. the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful. in fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. the convoluted plot held my interest throughout. finally, bruno nicolai's score may be the best i've heard from the composer. the main theme is so memorable i haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days.the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film's finale. first, the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. if you've seen more than a couple gialli, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings. second, the ending feels a little too rushed and, as a result, is a bit confusing. i'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me, but i'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all. a second viewing might just clear this up.

i loved this movie. when i saw it on febuary 3rd i knew i had to buy it!!! it comes out to buy on july 24th!!! it has cool deaths scenes, hot girls, great cast, good story , good acting. great slasher film. the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls. see this movies

i really enjoyed this thriller! i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. the cast was excellent, the plot was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i've ever seen! the girls in it were really cute also, especially denise richards. she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph!

i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes... this is definitely really about a 5.5..... ummm.. it was kind of bloody, had likeable, shallow characters, and it had some really hot babes in it. i like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way everytime... that sometimes gets old.

katherine heigl, marley shelton, denise richards, david boreanaz. even before i knew what this film was about, these names were enough to draw me in. gorgeous, talented and popular, these are performers to look out for.ok, where do i start. we already know what the film is about. five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher, a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago. his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose. his weapon of choice: well, take a pick - axe, knife, electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. ok, so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality.horror movies aren't supposed to be shakespeare, but i'm not gonna go there. i love horror movies, but not all of them. this one, i adore. it's up there with some of my other favorites. it's funny, sexy and scary. the killer's mask is childishly creepy, and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky. the acting is topnotch: denise richards, marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun. i really did wish to see much, much more of katherine heigl. i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon. jessica capshaw is a very capable actress, and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2. the smaller parts were also good; hedy buress was a hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her.highlights: every death scene had a particular distinction to it. the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue. the hottub scene, while ludicrous, was well done. and the audiovisual maze was sinister. the soundtrack is great, with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes.lowpoint: i felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough, we barely saw the mask, and it wasn't featured at all during the climax. i also thought the climax was really unfocused, but fun nonetheless.the twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise, but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine.i don't like to tell people which movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing, then valentine would be it.my rating: 10/10 (bullseye!)

simply the best estonian film that i have ever seen, although it is made by a finnish director ilkka järvi-laturi. tallin pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the republic of estonia. but at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many eastern european countries at that time. in the early 90s soviet union fell into pieces and many countries, such as estonia, became independent. now the conditions may be better in most of those countries. but in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the soviet era had left them as inheritance. (and many of them still do...at least on some level...) tallinn pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script. the actors are also very good, especially jüri järvet (perhaps the best known estonian actor, plays snaut in tarkovski's solaris), playing and old gangster who's slowly becoming tired of his way of life. but the most astonishing performance comes from monika mäger, a child-actor playing terje, a boyish girl in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is quite essential. (and her name is not even mentioned in the imdb-credit list!!!)wthere are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time. but tallinn pimeduses does that. unfortenately järvi-laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievements. his first one, kotia päin was too artificial and his latest, history is made at night was just a weird mess.

this is one of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of time.darkness in tallinn was made in 1993.it was a period of chaos,confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary denizens of estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty soviet empire.it was in such a tense climate that a young country named estonia was born.as newly established governments are known to encounter teething problems,estonia too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means.this is one of this film's core themes.darkness in tallinn appears as an estonian film but it was made by a finnish director ilka järvilaturi. he has tried his best to infuse as many possible doses of estonian humor.this is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones.as ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film signifies good versus evil.this is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different faiths.darkness in talinn shows us as to how ordinary governments can also be toppled by corrupt people.a nice film to watch on a sunny day.

i first saw this at a foreign film festival. it's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. it's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states beautifully (note: tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there).there's a lot of humor and some romance, too. i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so i'll just say this heist film starts from a great script, and the directing and performances are top notch. darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre --- i'd put it up against rafifi, topkapi, and it's miles ahead of the new ocean's 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. rent or buy it now.

some genre films need to be dressed up. this one was an exception. taken on its own merit, it's a dressed down version of the horror genre film. with minimal special effects, it manages to be a psychological study of sorts, with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by the bus, and why her? it's not a great film, yet because there is little contrived about it, the story works. subtle, and all about the interactions of the characters. actually, there is one contrivance in the opening scenes, but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what's to come. i very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy, and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge. you will enjoy the film if you have some empathy, value the need for a bit of adventure in your life, and wonder "what would i do in this situation?"

the film was very outstanding despite the nc-17 rating and disturbing scenes. in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it. it all starts with maya (rosario dawson in superb performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. she meets jared (chad faust in a terrific performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. he invites her out to dinner. they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. they talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. she tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. this incident scars her. she goes to a club meets a bartender/dj adrian (greatfully played by marcus patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far. they strike a friendship. he also does drugs and maya starts using as well. in other words introduces her to a different world. she starts going back to school and working as ta (teaching assistant) and spots jared as one of the students. while the students are taking a midterm, she catches jared cheating. jared tries to smooth talk maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. will history repeat itself? or will maya have a surprise for jared? you watch the movie. excellent a. rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance. chad faust does not like he can be a rapist, but he does a terrific job as jared. marcus patrick is very brilliant the man who saves maya and coaches her into a new world. this film deserves an award.

"descent." yeah. boy... i haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since bruno dumont's, "twentynine palms" (2003). (by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of "female empowerment," "the descent" (2005), directed by our splat pack friend, neil marshall, who also happens to be a major talent his own right.) but getting back to this "descent," the nc-17 rated (uh-oh) effort on which the lovely ms. dawson takes a producer's credit (congratulations) and directed by talia lugacy (strong chance that's not a real name), as good as it is (in moments), it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed. as a producer, you really have to tighten up that script. of course, in the premise alone, you have the promise of rising conflict, but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict.at times, this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and, well, i guess i'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it, namely that which occurs in the second act -but find me a second act that isn't boring? there's also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasi-independent films like "descent" in which rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her "fame-identity" to get a script into production that would, under usual circumstances, not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role. rosario dawson is gorgeous and, apparently, you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long, but, oh, wow-wee, how fast the time just slips away: rosy ain't no undergraduate no more. that's part of the confusion about the screenplay: "is she a graduate student? a ta? no, graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players, do they?" again, if you are rosario dawson, executive producer, that's the one of many, many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career. and if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing, let me tell you: there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious, well-qualified, undergraduate aged talents, pining to get involved in the business, who might have nailed that lead character down, all the while, looking just as darn good as you know who; but unfortunately without ms. dawson -no honey, no money. i have to say, the camera department did an outstanding job, however, because this film is really well shot (i.e. lit) in all its dreary/dreamy darkness. the nightclub scenes look wonderful; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time... the shooting/framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch."descent" is good not great. however, i have a feeling, thanks to netflix, this movie will find a life of its own. i hope this group continues making films. if you're into experimental american film-making, cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs (or male model drop-outs) in their early twenties, or if you're an undergraduate, just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your american university, "rosario dawson's descent" might be your flavor of rockaroll.

another entry in the "holiday horror" category that fills the shelves of your local video store. the *spoiler* "wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him" plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before. and those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it. marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz, denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it. oh, and i loved the creepy mask.

love rosario dawson, think she's one of the finest actresses of the modern era.descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. it's the consistent undertone in everything in the film. the dialog is flat, the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided. the only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and rosario's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.pitching this as a rape classic isn't appropriate, and that's probably why so many people don't enjoy the film. the standard 'rape' audience wouldn't particularly like this film, and maybe that's the point? the film asks more questions than it answers, and it does confront it's target audience, whether they like it or not. there's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesn't slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons.descent is a good film which imho is severely under-rated.

this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience. the many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victim's mind are arrogant. as a victim, i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of maya. i agree that this is an incredibly brave film. this looks at rape from a different, more realistic standpoint than any other movie i've ever seen on the subject. the end did drag on a bit long, but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1%. it's good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to.

this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story. i too cannot understand why people would trash this movie.if you are a jerry bruckheimer fan, this movie may not suitable for u.this movie presents high degree of realism. the actors and actresses' performance is examplary. not fake, just natural. no special sound.effects, so special side effects.the camera work is excellent, the music is oh so good. i can't wait to get the soundtrack.it leaves your body numb, like constant garderner.the directly has raw talent, certainly not a follower.

a compelling, honest, daring, and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape - "descent" is a film that went under-the-radar due to its lack of distribution because, frankly, the film is so brutal in its depictions, that if it had been released theatrically, it may have met itself to some strong biased hate.the film deserves to be discovered for, not only its dark themes, and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style - but most of all for its performances. chad faust is absolutely stunning, bringing enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one, not relate to, but understand this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes, but also the fragile insecurities deep within his own self. it's a supporting performance that is so complex, brave, and emotional on faust's part. and hard to forget.however, the standout is rosario dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. a tour-de-force of realistic dramatic tics, and one of the most subtle, yet loud-as-can-be performances in quite some time. while dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great-to-bad films, she proves here she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving performances, believably and thematically.one of the best films of its year (and 2007 was a strong one) - had this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release, i would be screaming praises for it, as well as dawson and faust. too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal. films like this deserve better!

i rented this movie simply because rosario dawson was in it. i sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats. not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes, but because it was a real film. no hollywood bs, no explosions, no corny one liners; film. it drew you in slowly, reeling you toward a tragically human fate. some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken. they like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone. michael bay's transformers and the like were produced for just this audience. no need to think people, just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain. we'll even place advertisements throughout the movie, to keep you buying our products. and don't forget the explosions, we all love explosions. here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways. entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily. movie are entertainment. descent is a film. film is art.if you still house a soul within your walking meat-sack apparatus, this rape scene is every bit as powerful as "irreversable". the distinction here is that "irreversable" was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued. "descent" is about date rape. no less disgusting. no less depraved. just different. this is about trust violation, soul desecration and the scars that run deep. had the character "maya" been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene. but seeing as she was desperate to escape, the scene is sickening. "jared" is a sick and manipulative serial rapist, and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair. how could "maya" ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her "jared's" slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? she is ruined.the film as a whole is beautiful. the camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on "maya" and the silent inner workings of her mind. all this accomplished by rosario with facial expression and gesture. the soundtrack was excellent, a blend of everything. my particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together; "maya" dancing in a sea of writhing bodies, something inside her awakening, becoming aware, all set to a beautifully sad jeff buckley tune.i don't think i've really spoiled anything here but i'm stopping before i do. bottom line, i think this was the best film of 2007, hands down. unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash, gang rape, or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered. death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. it's only the last thing that will happen in this existence. the worst things that happen never leave you. they are always in your thoughts. when you shower; when you brush your teeth; when you buy a christmas present, when you tie your shoe; they haunt you. they haunt you until that last thing releases you.treat yourself. challenge yourself. watch this film.

first, this was a brave film. i've seen irreversible and can understand the comparisons. however, i cannot begin to understand the people who've trashed this film. i can see how the end may have come off extreme but i'd be lying if i didn't say i wished that every guy who's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what jared got. conversely, it didn't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn't pretend to is what made me appreciate it.the comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with. i certainly did and intently. i'm 24 years old. the way the film drags made it realistic to me. people have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film, not only do they lose interest, they demolish whatever has been built, and call it rubbish. when in actuality it's their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as talia lugacy's.rosario dawson displayed the numbness of self-destruction flawlessly. i think she portrayed maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act i rarely ever see done well. often times, much like the films "aimed at teens" mentioned in the prior comment, the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. dawson, in my opinion, manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to: drone-like existence in the waking hours, working some dead end job to survive (and distract) and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings.i thought this film told the truth and i appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape. so many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning...i believe that maya's face during the act was the end...not the act itself...not the vengeance or the meaning behind it...just her face...thank you

yesterday i attended the world premiere of "descent" at the tribeca film festival in nyc. i had a great time. it was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my-spacer marcus patrick.i give the movie 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars.the movie begins with maya (rosario dawson) at college. you can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on. the photography in this film was excellent. she meets jared (chad faust) and they become sweethearts. it appears like any other relationship in the beginning. the man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get. both played this well. very innocent flirtation between the two. he invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart.the apartment is very dreary and dark. they eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. this actually reminded me of a dungeon. here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her. this is a very dark and gritty rape scene. this scene is not for the young or weak at heart. the rape scene is a little long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows.maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex. she falls into her own abyss. she starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there. she is told to go see adrian (marcus patrick). the first thing i remember about this character is that they say "he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving". he is actually the one who introduces maya to drugs. they begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie. the club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise. i thought they were well done and i noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience.maya is then back in college as a ta and who is in her class -- jared her rapist!! you could see the confusion and emotion on maya's face. what should i do?? what do i do next?? the shots of her face and the emotions are priceless.what unfolds next is not actually whats happening. she acts interested in jared. she appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again. i was sitting there saying could this really be happening. it wasn't. nothing could be farther from the truth.she invites him to her apartment and of course, he shows up. now her apartment is dark and gritty. she has him strip down completely. he thinks he's going to get "lucky". she then teases him like any woman can. she's caressing him everywhere and he's getting excited. note:: for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity - may not be right for the younger viewer.she then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him. once again, the scene is dark, gritty, and very rough.if you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph.this is where adrian reenters the picture. maya has adrian save(?) her by performing extremely rough male sex with jared. she thinks this is the final revenge. adrian continues to take all of jared's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing. marcus, as adrian, plays this scene as believable as anyone can. he is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen. after the movie, during a q&a session, marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and chad. maya believes that this revenge will save her but i don't think it does. one of the final scenes has a closeup of mays's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek. this was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie. did she get the revenge she wanted?? was it as satisfying as she expected?? in my opinion, it does not. it only makes matters worse.this is an excellent movie, will well acted roles, and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it. i would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age. rosario, chad, and marcus should be commended for jobs well done. the directing and photography must also be commended. it was a night that i enjoyed.

the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced. apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist'). in those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.

what an awesome movie! it was very scary, great acting, well-written, nice plot twists, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non-horror fans, but is still (nonetheless) one of the best thrillers out there today! i highly recommend it to only fans of:1) the horror genreor2) an actor or actress featured in it.*** out of **** stars!ps- i am sick and tired of people comparing this, and other modern horror movies, with scream. ya know what, they didn't want to be like scream. everyone's like "oh, they copied scream!". well, if i am not mistaking, scream also copied other movies too! in fact, just about every horror movie copied an earlier one. scream, however, was a good film. but, still... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is!go and rent this one!

valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good. marley shelton did great as the female lead (much better than jennifer love hewitt in the "i know..." films). david boreanaz, whom is the main reason i saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played it well. the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards. she was horrible in this. the only scene i was glad to see her in was *spoiler* her death scene. all in all, it's a good movie to watch. you should definitely watch this before you watch "scream" or "i know..." again.

these slasher pics are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun.the valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out.the film has one peach of a line... "he's no angel...." when he in fact is angel!!! watching buffy reruns will never be the same!the cast is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters. sorry but no!the direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imaginations implied threat. much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes...:-(essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the "borrowing" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks. psycho's shower scene is tributed, along with halloween's "masking". murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know!!!light viewing, not very scary but a few good jump moments. if it was a choice between the hole and this though, choose the hole. slasher movies have had their day, and this is just another slasher. a very good slasher, but nothing groundbreaking!!!

i love this movie. it was one of my favorite movies. the action never stops. the whole movie was done very well. the ending is really good. ontop of it being action filled, they even have a surprised put in there for you. when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie, but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance. i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie. it was very original. whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me. the acting was great. luke perry did an excellent job once again. i give this movie the highest rating.

call me stupid, but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie, valentine. it was so well-made, well-written, well-acted, well-directed, etc! everything about it was wonderful! there were parts that were relatively routine (lily's death), very funny (www.bleed-me-dry.com), completely horrifying and creepy (paige's death), and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene). i think the entire cast did a great job, especially the three leads: david boreanaz, denise richards (both of whom i met, and got autographs from, during the filming of this movie - very nice people!), and marley shelton.i am very sick of people calling this movie "another scream clone". this movie is, in no way, a scream clone. in fact, this film runs rings around scream. it actually makes sense! scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it. excuse me, but it looks like scream was also a clone too (ahem..., friday the 13th, halloween, and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). i also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. it's so strange to see a sweet, cupid face doing all of these horrible things. another novelty (the nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! the ending gives me chills every time i see it!!!!! so, even if you didn't like it the first time, watch valentine again and give it another chance!ps- keep an eye out for my new website (www.love-hurts.org)! coming soon...

this movie was pretty good. the acting was great, and there were some really great actors in it like, buchholz and roger moore. this film is full of surprises. confusing at times...yes, but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense. the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars.

the cast is excellent, the acting good, the plot interesting, the evolvement full of suspense...but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely 80 minutes long. if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots, it would have a much better effect. another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one.

not as bad a film as i thought it would be.it has a good cast.nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors.would like to see more of olivia d`abo in future projects.maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy maryam d`abo.also a good use of unseen locations such as luxembourg.hopefully we will see more uk-european co-productions like this.

when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine, i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment, but surprise, surprise, i loved it. convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles, let alone take in the ridiculous explanation. these quibbles apart, however, the film is a dream. fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score. he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so. really enjoyable with lots of colour, plenty of sexiness, some gory kills and minimal police interference. super.

i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever. when i watched valentine, i was amazed at how great the story line actually was. it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all. the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor, and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring, but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful. it had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets. i recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on valentine's day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills. oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer or rating, please, don't...

it's a colorful slasher movie. that's about it.it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies, but i never care for such things. figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway.the death scenes were inventive and gorey, bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th. another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl, unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious. people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie. as simple as that. i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same. --mb

i just saw "valentine" and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years. unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking. for those out there that hated "scream," there is not one reference to "the horror rules" in this movie (even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here). this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror. you get the style, cinematography, and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick. i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for. this is definitely a move in the right direction.denise richards stands out here as a fun character. you can tell she liked her role, and that makes her stand out. i loved her in this movie.

i'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. i classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial. valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks, after his urban legends. unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes valentine the best. as the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth. since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of him. when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come to see this point of view of humanism: "noone is entirely good or evil. in fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted." just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. the second iconic element is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date, never able to met with. katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables. denise richards is killed third, while she just found a valentines' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer. marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know, 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed. finally, benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer, david boreanaz.the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the valentines' day celebration at dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes. everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know. hard rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie.

** warning - contains spoilers! **first of all, i would like to say that i really liked this game. i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents. i am glad that i did that.first off, i would like to say that the single player was very good. the first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you are at a party in london, and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. of course you have to rescue her, and it is quite a big level, but should probably take you at least five minutes. the best part, and i think also the funniest part, is when you are in the jet-pack, and people are rappelling down big ben. just equip the jet-pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down. pure fun!the rest of the levels are very good, but pretty short. there are four mini-levels you can unlock, and that is one of the let downs, because only the first two of them are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives, i mean, c'mon! we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad!the multi player, me and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games! you can be a load of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character.gameplay - 8.5/10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphic, but that isn't extremely often). multiplayer - 10/10 (needs no comment, just great, you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles). sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10 (the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1).i give this game: 8.5/10could have a bit of improvement, but it's still good.

ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world. the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional. i got this game april 2007 (two years after release), and i am still impressed with the gameplay. it's a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games.i give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over. the only thing i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level, it was too much pressure. on the whole i like the game a lot!!

this james bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite james bond game so far because: the missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good. the cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play. the voice over actors are really good and it is cool that sean connery does the voice for james bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like sean connery when he played james bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie. the graphics a pretty good in this james bond game. also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool.overall score ********** out of **********

the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy: step into the shoes of agent 007. "frwl" comes closer to this goal than any other game, because this time you control the real james bond. no offense to pierce brosnan, who made a fantastic bond and loaned his voice and likeness to "eon", but sean connery was the original james bond, and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool.i must say at this point, like many others who have reviewed this game, that sean 70 year old voice doesn't fit his 30 year old image on screen, and this takes some getting used to, but it's certainly worth it. he makes lines like "bond james bond" and "shaken, not stirred" into a big deal again. but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as octopus is, as bond said in "octopussy", "only the tip of the tentacle." the awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel. it's the original gun barrel from the movies. then you take on first mission, rescuing the prime minister's hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at parliament, and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro. the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond, right down to the classic rock-n-roll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game, as bond infiltrates a secret factory.after the game's opening, the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie "frwl." james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a lektor device from a russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him. in turkey, bond teams up with lovable sidekick kerim bey. bond must retrieve the device, protect the damsel in distress, and get both safely back to london. bond screenwriter bruce feirstein worked on the script, and he's done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie. the characters from the movie are all recreated well, but some are better than others. the impersonators voicing villains rosa klebb and red grant are uncanny. and there's a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss moneypenny, m, and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery 007 movies.what puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games, besides sir sean's voice and likeness, is two notable features in the game play. one is bond focus. while you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other, an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at, such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death. the other notable feature is the stealth and mêlée kills. when you're in close enough range, just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean connery's james bond displayed.sean connery's bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent, so you only have a few gadgets, but they're good ones. the q-copter is a remote control helicopter that can self-destruct and explore areas bond can't reach, like the q-spider in "eon", only better. the classic laser watch is useful, not just for getting into sealed rooms, but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available. sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with, but you must experience them for yourself. besides the gadgets, you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game, including the gray suit from the movie, the standard black tuxedo, a retro stealth suit, and that classic white tuxedo, all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies. when you drive in the game, you drive the aston martin db5 straight out of "goldfinger." it can't turn invisible, but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie. and when you're not flying down the streets of istanbul in the "goldinger" car, you can fly through the air in the "thunderball" jet pack.then there's the multi-player. of course, it has to be compared to the standard of the "goldeneye" game, and it fails. also, you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game. but the multi-player is amusing, and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing. the basic game does have other flaws. some of the movie's most exciting moments, particularly the gypsy camp shootout, bond's brawl with red grant on the orient express, and a confrontation between bond and rosa klebb's bladed shoe, aren't done justice in game form. and the game is a fast play, even on the hardest difficulty. but overall, this game is the best james bond experience so far.

good: engaging cinematic firefights, great presentation, vehicles are actually fun to drive, fairly appealing multiplayer, faithful to the movie, and the list goes on.bad: main missions are a bit short.this game defines what a "good" third person shooter(not necessarily a spy-game) is. great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission through, and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer. the hype this game had, was lived up to, and i personally think you should buy it, and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one. loads of fun. the sound in this game, is a rip-roaring achievement from a few previous bond games, and firing a weapon, really feels like you're firing a weapon. it ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy.all in all, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through, and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty james bond "nightfire" game for gamecube.

a group of model-caliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine's day cards. who is the killer and why is the killer after them? my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. however, i can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine. the first time i watched it, upon its theatrical release, i thought it was pretty awful--i gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an "f" letter grade. watching it for a second time last night, i can't remember what the heck i didn't like about it. i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe i just didn't get it. in any event, i loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an "a".it might sound ridiculous saying i didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. valentine is almost a comedy/horror. director jamie blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's urban legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). on top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the valentine's day theme.many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. however, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. it's as if blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. that's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine's day. it's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for valentine's extravagant lampooning. scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was "self-aware". valentine's day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. lest some think i'm "reading too much" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he "didn't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend" and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something "more adult".other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine's day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by tom savage. the novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. sellers has said, "while it was a fine book, i didn't think it was the right story for a film". so instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on valentine's day. while those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. it's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.blanks' direction is impeccable visually. valentine's day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. he also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. david boreanaz, as adam carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments.while valentine's day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. if you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more.

i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. i am glad i did. it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game. i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie/game remake. the bonus levels were very hard! the sniper one i think was too hard, it made me so frustrated i didn't play the game for a week and a half. there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. the only thing i might change was the upgrade system. i didn't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. i really liked the q copter. i think the developers did a good job.

"pandora's clock" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film. this movie, which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in 1996, is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease. the u.s. government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (richard dean anderson) and a virus expert (daphne zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster. i'm not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries, but i liked "pandora's clock". it's one heck of a thrill ride. jane leeves (tv's "frasier"), robert loggia, and edward herrmann (as the president) also star.*** (out of four)

i've seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student, the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out. this one, however, was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end. having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a-b that he normally gives. it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii. also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again. i can't say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role. all in all a highly recommended film.

sometimes, lady luck smiles on me. i had originally made -- and copied over -- a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation. i was heartbroken when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else.recently, i subscribed to digital cable, and while searching through upcoming movies, there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie. this time, however, i made a copy of it to dvd so there's no chance of repeating my mistake.i finally got to watch it again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it. there is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with "pandora's clock" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. i just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch, and from the first installment, i was hooked. each day, i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read.when i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie, i made sure to clear my schedule for that event.first of all, i'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book, contrary to what another reviewer had said. that, in itself, is a rare achievement for tv movies.secondly, i agree with others about the casting. i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson. literally, the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role. anderson has never been better, and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him. in fact, all of the cast members did a superb job.my only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the "terrorist plot" to arm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane. basically, we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one, and folks, that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved. also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one, then two of its engines blown off.that beef aside, i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film, as well as our own.if you have an opportunity to see this movie, do so by all means.

pandora's clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see. a highly faithful adaptation of john j. nance's novel ,which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel,is made even more so here. despite being made for tv, this is first rate entertainment. the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. jane leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor. daphne zuniga is great as dr. sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. robert loggia, edward herrmann, robert guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.there are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel. the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie. the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they work fine. sets are great, especially cia hq and the oval office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work.it doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. this will leave you breathless.

i began watching a replay of this tv movie on a sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick. i was wrong."pandora's clock" is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most tv movies. it could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen.the cast is excellent, including veteran actors richard dean anderson, edward herrmann, robert guillaume, and robert loggia. daphne zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the cia, and frasier's jane leeves is also very good. the dialogue is well-written and the story is compelling throughout. in fact, the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you can't leave your seat for a second. if you get a chance to see this movie, invest the time -- nearly four hours. you will be richly rewarded!

i don't understand the low 5.7 rating on this film. it's a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics. the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil, down to the locale (savannah). the acting is strong, and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth branagh's southern accent. famke jansen is great, robert duval is effective in a small part, and embeth davitz is the bomb. great full nude scene of her,too.the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed.

the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of daryl hannah. rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-weary character. she doesn't have a huge role but she does a great job portraying lois harlan as a woman tired of, although used to, covering up for her boss' indiscretions.

i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one. altman's touch with zooms in and out were there, and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations. unfortunately, as far as i could see, they sometimes were gratuitous, sometimes witty, often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection. in particular, two zoom-outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed. to be fair, though, a few zooms (outs and ins) to branagh heightened his character's increasing bewilderment, a la pudgy mccabe's or philip marlow's. on the whole, the zooms were, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even trite.other almanesque devices, such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject, succeeded in suggesting characters' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge. car windshields, house windows, and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently, i felt, harking back to the player and even the long goodbye. a few catchy jump-cuts, especially to a suggestive tv commercial, reminded me of such usage in short cuts, to sardonic effect.but finally, the mismatch between altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham-genre momentum, failed to excite me. this director's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres, including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways; this time around, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre. was he muzzled in by mammonist producers, perhaps? or am i missing something, due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here?nonetheless, the casting was excellent all around: tom berenger (for his terrifying ferality), branagh for his (deflated) hubris, robert downey jr's pheromonal haze, robert duvall's method of trash, and davidtz's lurking femme-fatality were near perfect choices all. and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of (brunette?) daryl hannah, accents were convincingly southern.suspense and mood were engrossing, even if the story didn't quite rivet viewers. the moodiness of a coastal pre-hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely, painstakingly rendered--i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto.torn, in the end i judged it a 7.

a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel. altman creates a suspenseful, gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. sporting a southern drawl, branagh is convincing as the lawyer, and davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire. downey is likable as a private detective. duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast. after an interesting setup, the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but altman is always worth a look.

any screen adaptation of a john grisham story deserves a mainstream hollywood approach, and robert altman is about the last director i would go to for a mainstream take on anything. but this southern-fried pot-boiler is pretty good. while it's not among altman's best, it certainly isn't among the films he's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking.altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before, in his 1973 film "the long goodbye." "the gingerbread man" is nowhere near as good as that film, but it holds up fairly well on its own. kenneth branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client (embeth davidtz) who has enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckoo father (robert duvall). the film is set in savannah, georgia during the approach of a tropical storm, which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that i very much liked. the twists and turns toward the film's end become clunkier and clunkier, and altman proves himself to be not all that adept at staging shootouts, but overall the film is not a bad addition to altman's canon.also starring robert downey, jr., daryl hannah, tom berenger and famke janssen.grade: b

robert altman is my favorite american director. i must admit that i have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned: "quintet", if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown-up and beautiful brigitte fossey, who was unforgettable as the little girl in "forbidden games"; "health", for having lauren bacall, carol burnett, alfre woodard and glenda jackson, all in the same cast; "popeye", for that splendid and surreal world, shelley duvall's olive oyl and the wonderful malta locations; "o.c. & stiggs", for its proposal of an anti-"adolescents flick"; "beyond therapy", for all its lunacy and for the presence of genèvieve page, who for all her effort to look parisian chic is taken for a travestite... i have even enjoyed his one-act tv movies, like "the dumb waiter" and "the laundromat". when there is not much plot to develop in his films, you have wonderful performances, from burnett, john travolta, kim basinger or jane curtin. i perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the united states. it is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated, and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out american prizes and awards. he is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies. he is more of a maverick. so it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about "the gingerbread man", his most 'mainstream' effort to date and to my knowledge. i did not know there were so many people who thought like leonard maltin, who does not like altman at all. in this case, one may dislike "the gingerbread man", but for me the reason has more to do with grisham than with the director-screenwriter. some of altman's trademarks are here: improvised dialogue, great performances, a funny lawyers' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary. while some people find it boring, i found the first act fascinating, thanks also for the great cinematography by changwei gu, the man who shot "red sorghum", "ju dou" and "farewell my concubine". he has a way of showing us the same things we see in other american movies, but under a different light. through his "foreigner's gaze", almost everything seems new and different. in this first act, things were so logical and true! wait until you get older. you may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as embeth davidtz. i know for myself what i have done fascinated by someone who is younger than i am! then you have robert duvall's repellent, menacing and mysterious character, while that geraldo storm is threatening savannah. the second act gets a little phony and even funny, because altman may have conducted it with a grin. i remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks. i think he was applying a bit of brecht, distancing us, preparing us for the third act, which is plain hollywood pastiche. altman does it with expertise. being a wise man, and an intelligent director, luckily he did not fall into the traps of today's action movies. he was directing a tale of lust, greed and death. i was not disappointed a bit with the movie. if i give it a nine instead of 10, it is because of grisham. the american reader has turned him into a best-selling author. so why complain? maybe we should thank altman for showing us the seams in his stories, the dullness, the flatness and the silliness of them all. however, he does it with so much gusto and humor, that i cannot but disagree with the negative comments. for me, these persons saw another movie... and vice versa.

"the gingerbread man is the first thriller i've ever done!"  robert altman in 1955 charles laughton directed "the night of the hunter", a spooky slice of southern gothic in which robert mitchum plays a scary serial killer. one of the film's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from mitchum on a rowboat, the kids frantically paddling whilst mitchum wades after them like a monster. seven years later mitchum played an equally spooky killer in "cape fear", another film set in the american south. that film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with mitchum terrorising folks on a boat. in 1991 martin scorsese, trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream, remade "cape fear", boat scene and all.now we have robert altman's "the gingerbread man", another slice of small town southern gothic. altman says he consulted "the night of the hunter" for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to "spread his wings and try a popcorn picture", but what he's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the southern gothic genre.so instead of a showdown on small boat, we get a showdown on a giant ship. instead of two kids being kidnapped, we get two kids being safely returned to the police. instead of money being hidden, we have money being readily given via a last will and testament. instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake, we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer in kenneth branagh. instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys. instead of the monster breaking into the family's house boat, we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster's "house ship". similarly, instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by robert duvall. . .etc etc etc.altman goes on and on, reversing everything just a little slightly, pulling at the edges and doing his own thing. his touch is most apparent during the film's first half-hour, the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot-driven movie storytelling and altman's fondness for overlapping dialogue, casual narratives, prowling camera movement and the way that characters aren't so much introduced as they are simply part of what's going on.still, despite altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity. altman's too bound to the conventions of the "thriller format" to do much damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre. "gingerbread man" is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure altman film and too altman to work as a mainstream thriller.the film's not a complete waste, though. robert downey junior, kenneth branagh and the usually intolerable daryl hannah, all turn in juicy performances. the film also has a nice atmosphere, set against a approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns. while it's not the complete disaster that scorsese's "cape fear" was, the film still never amounts to anything special.7/10  in the late 90s altman made 3 successive films set in the american south: "kansas city", "gingerbread man" and "cookie's fortune". unlike "gingerbread man", both "kansas city" and "cookie's fortune" tackle the genre on the broader, more looser canvases that altman was most comfortable with. "kansas city" is the more important of these two films, its hierarchies of class, politics and crime, and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks, would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers (see, for example, "the wire"). that said, "cookie's fortune", while a much slighter tale, is perhaps the better picture.note: altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he directed "images", an art house thriller, in 1972.worth one viewing.

robert altman shouldn't make a movie like this, but the fact that he did- and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller in that paperback-tradition of grisham thrillers- shows a versatility that is commendable. in the gingerbread man he actually has to work with something that, unfortunately, he isn't always very successful at, or at least it's not the first thing on his checklist as director: plot. there's one of those big, juicy almost pot-boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low-class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways, twists and plot ensues, yada yada. and it's surprising that altman would really want to take on one of these "i saw that coming from back there!" endings, or just a such a semi-conventional thriller.but it's a surprise that pays off because, oddly enough, altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior, or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble, of a small-town georgian environment. the film drips with atmosphere (if not total superlative craftsmanship, sometimes it's good and sometimes just decent for altman), as savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid. so the atmosphere is really potent, but so are performances from (sometimes) hysterical kenneth branaugh, embeth davitz as the 'woman' who lawyer branaugh gets caught up with, and robert downey jr (when is he *not* good?) as the private detective in branaugh's employ. did i neglect robert duvall, who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad-vibes of the picture on? as said, some of the plot is a little weak, or just kind of standard (lawyer is divorced, bitter custody battle looms, innocent and goofy kids), but at the same time i think altman saw something captivating in the material, something darker than some of the other grisham works that has this standing out somehow. if it's not entirely masterful, it still works on its limited terms as a what-will-happen-next mystery-southern-noir.

with this movie, it's all about style, atmosphere, and acting. true, i didn't believe all of the plot developments, but it didn't matter- the terrific acting, the unexpected plot twists, and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in, and carried me along for the ride, and i had a great time. kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents, and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent. he's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles (robert downey, jr., embeth davidtz from schindler's list and fallen, tom berenger, daryl hannah, and robert duvall) that i was simply blown away. i recently bought a copy of this movie, and i never tire of watching it. simply one of the best thrillers of the year. if you've ignored this movie (and chances are you have), then i suggest you check it out.

tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations....paul mcgann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.there is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character (ben turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton. inevitably they cross over... who has done what?the examination of why, both in the past and in the present, rather than who might have yielded a more interesting, dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining?

this is possibly the best short crime drama i've ever seen. the acting is superb especially amanda burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...she does an amazing job balancing rachels/carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama. the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv/film. the ending,which i'm not going to give away,is fantastic mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what i mean after you've seen it) this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're one cold hearted person.

many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path: murder most foul, gathering of clues, gaggle of possible perps, sprinkling of red herrings, and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver."forgotten" abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts. the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some, but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes, disturbs, and haunts with the question: what does an evil person look like?excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily... forgotten.

the fourth man (paul verhoeven - netherlands 1983).a film based on a novella by gerard reve, that works best as a thriller. that's quite surprising, considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work."the fourth man" is top-heavy on symbolism. paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. in "the fourth man" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. there's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise good story. nevertheless, when you can cope with verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round, thom hoffman and jeroen krabbé in particular.camera obscura --- 7/10

most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in hollywood. but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land. the story is a basic femme fatale premise, nothing new or enthralling. verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences, which instead of defining our main character and his situation, are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot. the screenplay was solid, the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story. what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting. jereone krabbe was amazing as the "tortured artist", and the supporters were very good as well. also, jan de bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film, helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director.6.5/10* * 1/2 / * * * *

jerome crabbe has the lead role in this movie. i saw this movie 6 times and i still am not tired of it. this movie is similar to flesh + blood in some ways. gerald soetman is a great writer. he wrote all of paul verhoeven's dutch films. paul verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. i have seen all of his movies all except for showgirls. my mom does not like him so much but i disagree. i think all of his films are a ride to watch especially total recall and basic instinct. jerry goldsmith did some of his movies which include total recall, basic instinct and hollow man. i wish jerry goldsmith never died. dutch films are different but still enjoyable.

awful dreams, wild premonitions, blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate paul verhoeven's (arguable) masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them. filled with blood and occasional gore, the fourth man is truly neurosis inducing. men will literally leap when renee swings out her scissors......

an occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people's buttons., the 4th man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct. the story's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic catholic writer, gerard (krabbe), with a seriously twisted sense of imagination. verhoeven offers upgerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. he's shiftless, delusional, unable to control his urges, afraid to commit tomeaningful relationships, and utterly apathetic about life in general. as the character himself states at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth.the movie opens with gerard dreaming of spiders consuming christ, and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction. he chases offone man (a boyfriend presumably), then chases another at a train station. later, at a lecture, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, orperhaps she has more nefarious plans.. she quickly captures gerard in her web, enticing him with sex and money, having plenty of both. she's also gotsecrets, like three dead husbands. is she lonely, and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow, luring gerard to hisdeath? will garard be the 4th man she kills? the woman is christine (soutendijk), and verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to.this is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue. it's similar to verhoeven's<em>basic instinct</em>, but has a lot more depth, and is certainly more shocking. there's a lot of very strong gay content, which may make some viewers squirm. highly recommended for fans of intelligentpsychological thrillers, or anyone looking for something entirely new.

the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival, i thought it intriguing, fascinating, the sensitive bi-sexual artist. so very european, so very dutch! i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious-sexual orientation persecution complex. get a grip! this guy is a freeloader, living off of society. i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy-nightmares about the "spiderwoman" is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year's of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars (and bed) with strangers! not only is he making outrageous sums of (probably taxfree) loot for making up stories (lying guilt trip) but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut, hence he hustles the beauty salon owner. then he has the nerve to complain about the bill! but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made. on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont's camera work and one of paul verhoeven's earlier films. hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed so very much after all?

when you read the summary of this film, you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is, for the primary character of this film, gerard reve (jeroen krabbé) is haunted by visions and hallucinations. the visions gerard see are all (more or less) subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film. despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute. this is mostly due to the great performances of jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk (christine) and the great direction of the whole by paul verhoeven. his directing style is clearly visible and one can say, looking at it from different angles, that 'de vierde man' is a typical verhoeven film. it will not only seem typical for people familiar with his american films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes, but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his dutch films, because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story. when people watch verhoevens american films, short sighted people might say, he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex. that is what some people think, whereas i think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film. although not a good film, hollow man (his last american film) is an example that verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm. he needs that. just watch his dutch films. not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom, but they also show that he has remarkable talent. 'de vierde man' brought him one step closer to hollywood and is certainly one of his best.8 out of 10

offbeat, slow-paced, entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. however, it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains, or to ignore krabbe's first-rate performance. verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the meaning of the hero's visions-omens. unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur, and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)

basically, i like verhoeven film because in his film, i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in "basic instinct".it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so it is obviously for me to watch this another verhoeven movie.well, it is his previous direction before his block buster hit "basic instinct" and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah, the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation.this movie "the fourth man" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences. the story of this movie is about a gay writer named "reve"(krabbe), an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident.after the end of his lecture, he introduce a seductive woman named "christine", who has a mysterious past she doesn't want to reveal.reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy.next morning, he watch her sexy, macho boyfriend's picture on her table, the person he met at the station.he is curious to meet him and tell christine to invite him to her house.that's it. i don't want to reveal the entire story because it is a verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising!especially, i like the character "reve" which is brilliantly played by "krabbe".i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face.i would like thanks mr.verhoeven to make such a black comedy.i rate this movie: 10 out of 10.

in it's time, this movie had controversy written all over it (like most of verhoeven's projects).containing very graphic depictions death-scenes; a parachute that doesn't open *smack* guys body on the floor. a guy being eaten by a lion *chomp* teeth in the throat. and a guy being run over by a speedboat *zoom* bloody corpse going down.but besides gore, this flick also contains some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful) scenes, filmed in the gray fisher's town that is vlissingen;thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman putting flowers in a milk-can, surrounded by slabs of blood-dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters, in a graveyard.the story is concluded in a frantic, but fulfilling 10 minutes, that don't disappoint, and will leave you sighing a breath of relief.of course with the pros come the cons, some special-effects are too over-the-top, and are obviously done to see how far verhoeven could push the gore-factor (e.g. the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets). also, while the two lead actors, (jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk), do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters, the character of herman (portrayed by the rather un-charming thom hoffman) just feels enormously underdeveloped, making him hard to care for, even after his tragic death.i've done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie, and as you can see, it's not easily summed up in words. so do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, watch it ! and enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.

gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination. he is also homosexual and catholic prone to catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant, or so it seems. on a trip to flushing he is 'seduced' by christine. when he discovers that christine's new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade he's been fancying from afar he decides to stick around. after all, enforced heterosexuality has its compensations. then he realizes that christine's previous three husbands have all died violent deaths. did christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend, herman, going to be 'the fourth man'? verhoeven's overheated, over-egged melodrama is a delicious blend of hitchcock and david lynch, full of ott eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red. a lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a figment of gerard's imagination. the fun is in figuring it out. also the fact that christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish gerard or the bullish herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her. in fact, it's fair to say gerard's comeuppance can't come soon enough. super performances, too, from jeroen krabbe and renee soutendijk and easily verhoeven's best film up to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci-fi "starship troopers".

this last dutch speaking film of verhooven made me laugh good. as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses. i haven't read gerard reves book, on which the film is based, but i still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self-conceited poet/writer who gets his (in a way - no spoiling here). an anti-hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions, as has he. all this in a superbly packaged cinematography, paul verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute "gesellich(?)" dutch locations into a suspenseful film-noir setting, impressive work!

this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films "basic instinct," "robocop," and "total recall," among others. he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard reve, an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination. gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from amsterdam. verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how gerard's imagination twists reality. asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper "and it says 'boom' i read 'doom,' when it says 'flood' i read 'blood,' when it says 'red' i see 'dead.'" when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it; "i lie the truth." he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club treasurer, a beautiful wealthy salon owner. as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died, he begins to imagine she is 'a black widow.' is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess? this is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory, i figured out is my favorite gender. looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven's too, and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality. it's a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare. i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that "stuck."

paul verhoeven has one of the strangest oeuvres of any major director: he started off making art-house films in his native netherlands before moving to hollywood where he began making subversive genre pieces which are often seen as mere entertainments by the mainstream crowd. 1983's the fourth man was the last film he made before moving to the u.s. and it seems to have been a transitional film for him.from the beginning of the fourth man it's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author gerard. in a seeming homage to carol reed's similarly titled 1949 film the third man the film begins with an author making a trip to speak to a crowd of literature enthusiasts. the similarities end there, however, as gerard runs into no major complications before arriving at the auditorium and the speech itself goes fairly smoothly. in spite of the relative ease with which he completes this function we know that the author is somewhat troubled as he has realistic fantasies about murdering his roommate before leaving his house and he also has a surreal fantasy involving a hotel he sees advertised and a detached eyeball growing out of a door's peephole. that he sometimes has trouble keeping his fantasies separate from reality is made all the more clear when an anecdote he tells is exposed as untrue and he admits that he "lie{s} the truth until {he} no longer knows whether something did or didn't happen." the fourth man is full of surreal fantasies and dreams which are made all the more disturbing because it's very easy to see how they relate to events which we have seen occur and because they sometimes foreshadow events which haven't occurred yet. between the effectiveness of the unreal sequences and verhoeven's careful editing style this ends up being the most atmospheric film this side of don't look now and like that film this one is full of ambiguity. unlike that film the fourth man is also perversely funny as gerard's deeply held catholic beliefs seep into every aspect of his life including sexuality. he naturally associates a female hair stylist he knows intimately with the biblical delilah though he fears she'll remove an even more important symbol of masculinity with her scissors. in an erotic fantasy sequence that would make luis buñuel blush he substitutes a man he's attracted to for a life size statue of christ on the cross.the fourth man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity: it certainly seems as if gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his "lying the truth." the film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience.

viewing de vierde man (aka the fourth man) is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience. it's a very tight and intense psychological mystery/thriller from netherlands's paul verhoeven. he directed this film just before he got big with his "free-ticket to hollywood"-movie flesh + blood. in a lot of user-comments on this site i noticed the mentioning of alfred hitchcock. indeed, this movie might very well be hitchcockian, but i also noticed touches of early cronenberg (the visceral), flavors of david lynch (surreal story-linked visuals) and even roman polanski (plot-wise set-up). funny thing is that the movies by those directors i was thinking of while watching de vierde man weren't made until after 1983, the year of release of the fourth man. so go figure.very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by gerard reve this movie is based on. gerard reve is also the fictional name of the main character (a tormented writer, played by jeroen krabbé, balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis). now, has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word "rêve" is french for "dream"? and the film does feature a lot of dream-like/nightmarish sequences, often to that extend that you don't always know for sure if gerard is awake or dreaming himself. could this be coincidence...? maybe it's just me, but i don't think so. renée soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady (in a rather demanding role). she sometimes seems to be guilty of over-acting (in a subtle way). but that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays, since as this movie progresses, you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions. proves again what an excellent actress she is. i might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male & female nudity, as well as some rather explicit sex-scenes (and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for verhoeven's basic instinct).another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references/images, which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative/catholic movements at the time of its european release. either way, it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing. now, someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about de vierde man. one of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the virgin mary to resolve itself. i myself have big issues with the way catholicism has been, and still is sometimes, portrayed in many movies in any genre (so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies). but surprisingly, i had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to the fourth man. although the virgin mary-aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point, i also had fun with it, in a way. i think the keyword as to why it didn't bother me at all is 'duality'. because, this movie works on two levels. although 'divine intervention' might have resolved the plot-line from the protagonist's point of view... on the other hand: the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman. and that's the fun part: you never know for sure. and then there's the question: could it be that gerard reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come... like receiving omens? at one point in the movie, gerard even tries to fool christine into believing he is clairvoyant. the way he is playing christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold.so with its compelling story, convincing acting performances and adequate direction, de vierde man is a very much recommended viewing indeed (especially if you enjoy a solid european psychological horror film). but make sure you see the original dutch version (not the dubbed one).

i don't know if i'd consider it a masterpiece of not, but it's damn near close; it's extremely well made, artistic, suspenseful, intricately plotted, thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual-religious imagery. there's also some great camera-work from jan de bont, an atmospheric score from loek dikker and outstanding acting from jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk, the latter giving one of the most sneaky, subtle 'femme fatale' performance i've ever seen. like many other european movies, this movie has an unashamed, non-judgmental attitude toward sex, nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and/or surrealistic (some would say blasphemous) images. in other words, if you can't bear the thought of seeing a lust-driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you. what surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess. it mixes the abstract/surreal/parallel fantasy-reality scenes and somehow makes it all work. like any good mystery, you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses. there is not an out-of-left-field resolution here. the movie has direction, there's no needless filler and once it concludes, you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier. if you like the work of ken russell and david lynch, i can almost guarantee you will love this movie. hell, if you have no idea who they even are, you still might like it.i'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed, but the film's opening shot - through a web as a spider catches its prey - sets the stage as krabbé, as unshaven, smug, bisexual writer gerard reve (interestingly, also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on) crosses paths with a wealthy, mysterious, sexy woman named christine (soutendijk, melding androgynous stylings with simone simon-like innocence/cuteness that's pretty unnerving), who may be a literal 'black widow' responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands. the two become lovers and move in with one another, but we're led to believe (through christine's bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman - played by geert de jong - who may or may not actually exist) something terrible is boiling under the surface. when another of christine's lovers, the young and "beautiful" herman (thom hoffman), shows up at the house, things take an unexpected turn. and that's all you need to know.the 4th man was a huge art-house success in much of the world, but didn't make it over to the us until 1984, where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critics association. the most common video is the media release, which has been horribly dubbed. try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled anchor bay dvd release. since coming to america, verhoeven's career has had its ups and downs. he has made a few decent films (flesh & blood, robocop) and some lousy ones (showgirls). in fact, verhoeven's big hit basic instinct is almost like a less interesting, junior league version of the fourth man. soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in america and since grave secrets (1989) and eve of destruction (1991) were the best offers she was getting, she headed right back home to the netherlands.

when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "basic instinct" and some maybe of "showgirls". but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies: "de vierde man". this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible, which makes the whole experience even more intense. the performances by jeroen krabbe, renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional, and verhoeven's direction does the rest. "de vierde man" makes even "basic instinct" look quite tame... it can't get much better than this, a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema. 10 out of 10, at least...

the morbid catholic writer gerard reve (jeroen krabbé) that is homosexual, alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of vlissingen. while in the railway station in amsterdam, he feels a non-corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train. gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician christine halsslag (renée soutendijk), who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop sphinx, and they have one night stand. on the next morning, gerard sees the picture of christine's boyfriend herman (thom hoffman) and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station. he suggests her to bring herman to her house to spend a couple of days together, but with the secret intention of seducing the man. christine travels to köln to bring her boyfriend and gerard stays alone in her house. he drinks whiskey and snoops her safe, finding three film reels with names of men; he decides to watch the footages and discover that christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents. later gerard believes christine is a witch and question whether herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband. the ambiguous "the vierde man" is another magnificent feature of paul verhoeven in his dutch phase. the story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs; magnificent performance of jeroen krabbé in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer; and stunning cinematography. the inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many european movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers. there are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films; however, paul verhoeven uses the nudity of gerard reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism. last but not the least; the androgynous beauty of the sexy renée soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "o 4o homem" ("the 4th man")

"de vierde man" (the fourth man, 1984) is considered one of the best european pycho thrillers of the eighties. this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like "total recall", "basic instinct" and "starship troopers" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (jeroen krabbe) going to the seaside for recovering. there he meets a mysterious femme fatale (renee soultendieck) and starts a fatal love affair with her. he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances..."de vierde man" is much influenced by the old hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells. it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward. the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director dario argento.the cast is also outstanding, especially krabbe's performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career ("the living daylights", "the fugitive"). if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv, video or dvd, don't miss it!

paul verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'basic instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why. the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve (played by jeroen krabbé); a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. while there, he meets the seductive christine halsslag (renée soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him.paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things i like best about him. this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn't happen very often!). i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you'll see what i mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half...lovely.the acting in the fourth man isn't anything to write home about, but it's solid throughout. jeroen krabbé holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. it is renée soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct, but the original fatale did it best. paul verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view, all of which help to create the mystery of the story. verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish, but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use. of all the verhoeven films i've seen, this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me, it's worth the effort.

director paul verhoeven's american vehicles are of varied quality, but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks. this is the story of alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. but the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover. in the meantime, the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions. fascinating hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. i love films that make you think they are about something, but then you realize they are about something completely different. this is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half, and a quasi-religious surrealist saga during the second half. very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for kids or people that go to church every sunday. great cinematography by future director jan de bont. highly reommended!

paul verhoeven's de vierde man (the fourth man) is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen. it really was a pleasant surprise. the story concerns bi-sexual writer gerard (jeroen krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser christine (renée soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story. verhoeven and cinematographer jan de bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away. this is by far verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to robocop). true the fourth man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked. this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling. i even like the spider metaphor. 8/10

in holland a gay writer gerard (jeroen krabbe) gives a lecture. he stays overnight with a beautiful woman christine (renee soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). he plans to leave the next day, but gets a look at a picture of christine's hunky boyfriend herman (thom hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. then things get strange.a big x-rated art house hit in the us in 1983. why was it x rated? let's see...there's strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! paul verhoeven made this after "spetters". "spetters" was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. so, verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. he was right! critics loved the film not realizing that verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. still, it's a great film. it's beautifully shot by jan de bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious "hidden" layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. all the acting is great--krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with krabbe in the crypt.this is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! a 10 all the way.

no, this hilariously horrible 70's made-for-tv horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so-execrable-it's-downright-awesome sort of way. richard crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and yvette mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in "jackson county jail," sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit. pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the disney "witch mountain" pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den. boy, now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing? well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't, but it sure is funny, thanks to curtis ("night tide") harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both martine beswicke and r.g. armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman). favorite scene: the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. while stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo.

before cujo,there was lucky the devil dog. in 1978,on halloween night the movie"devil dog,the hound of hell" premiered. a story of a family getting a new puppy (from a farmer who just happen to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables) because their dog skipper was killed.coencidence? everyone loves the new dog,but there is something strange about him. it isn't long until the father mike barry(richard crenna,first blood)starts to notice.his wife betty(yvette mimieux,where the boys are,jackson county jail,snowbeast)is different and his kids charlie and bonnie(ike eisenman,witch mountain and fantastic vourage and kim richards,witch mountain,nanny and the professor,hello larry,tuff-turf)also have changed. does the dog have something to do with it? he's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family.this movie is great because it has ike and kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies. this is one of the many 70's made-for-tv horror movies that was actually scary for a made-for-tv horror movie. the music was creepy and even the ending which i won't tell made you think.this movie also stars ken kercheval(cliff barnes of dallas)and r.g. armstrong(who couldn't stay away from devil movies remember"race with the devil"?)it's worth watching.

the devil dog: hound of hell is really good film. it has good acting by the cast including richard crenna and r.g. armstrong.the music is spooky and gives that devilish chill!i liked the effects on the dog and i think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns,frill like part on his neck, and acted really viscous!if you like horror films and haven't seen the devil dog: hound of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i don't think you'll be disappointed!

not only does this film have one of the great movie titles, it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors ike eissenman and kim richards. i seem to remember this film being broadcast halloween week back in '78 going against linda blair in stranger in our house. i missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film. later, on repeat, i saw i made the right choice. the movie is not really bad, but, really lacks any chills or surprises. although, i did like the scene where richard crenna shoots the family dog to no avail.

yes it was a little low budget, but this movie shows love! the only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to "waterworld" and though the plot was good, the film never really tapped into it's full potential! strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night.

i've seen this movie more than once. it was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then. the only problem i had was with the title for the obvious reasons... one immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by drake's! leaving off the first part, 'hound of hell' would have sufficed.richard crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. but this was an enjoyable halloween fare offered by the cbs network. i loved the part where crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast. he asks the cab driver how to find this guy. great dialogue between the native cab driver and crenna in terms of the cabby dissing his own people's ethnic beliefs. 'aw, mr. barry, i left that stuff behind when i came down from the mountains...' - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and nobody knows how to really contact him. as far as supernatural fare goes, this movie is still enjoyable.

i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon. though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention, and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end. i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film (oops, didn't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior), and was very pleased to be able to watch it again (and in its entirety).i don't wholly understand the phenomenon, but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary. the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons, but are they actually scary? no, not very. likewise in the years since the 70s we've gotten horror movies that are cooler, more exciting, have much better production values and sophisticated special effects, are more fun, funnier, have effective "jump" moments, and some very creative uses of gore, but again... they aren't really scary! there's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films. the grainy film quality. the spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs. the "edge of dreamland" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently eq'd scores. the odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything. everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s, in the case of horror, works in its favor.specifically, in this film, the quiet, intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving. so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling, slavering, and overtly hostile ("cujo"?). the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form. the effects when that occurs, while unsophisticated by today's standards, literally gave me chills. the bizarre, vaguely-defined, "i'm not quite sure what i'm looking at" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be, rather than the hyper-real, crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films.while the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit, the actors all do a decent job. the pairing of the brother and sister from the "witch mountain" movies as, yes, brother and sister, is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting, but they do fine. yvette mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular. richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses. his self-doubt as he wonders whether his family's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled, though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he's been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté.the movie's the-end-question-mark type ending is one of the only ones i've seen that doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick, and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they'd be likely to do and how they'd feel about it.detractors of this film may say it's merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots, but hey, you could say the same thing about "blade runner". :-)

this is a pretty decent example of film noir. the setting is the early 50's with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us government.richard widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples. he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a-list about him. the interesting thing was that he was not only an anti-hero but through most of the film, an unlikeable anti-hero. that is not very normal. jean peters gave a so-so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold. that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the stool-pigeon.the plot had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and tough talk. there is a fight scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was pretty gritty and exciting.i think noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this film. for non-noir viewers, it may seem a little dated and the whole commie thing a tad overdone.

samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films. while "shock corridor" and "the naked kiss" represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of america and "the big red one" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "merrill's marauders" painted war as necessary hell and "pickup on south street" is about the dangers of communist spies. all of his films make for very entertaining viewing, and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker, fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors. "pickup on south street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the film-making style is remarkably ahead of its time. its also a very quickly-pace, tight, and occasionally brutal film noir.the acting across the board is fantastic. richard widmark makes for a great anti-hero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend. the show stealer is thlema ritter however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie. the angles fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal (this is very violent for its time). the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "pickup on south street" is a great action-paced noir thriller. "shock corridor" remains my favorite fuller film, but this is a very close second. (8/10)

richard widmark is a tainted character in this movie. he is a professional pickpocket. he's been in prison three times, yet at the beginning of the film, he tries to make it four. thelma ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody. jean peters is amazing as the girl flamed by widmark.this is a period piece during the mccarthy era where the red scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely. what is unusual about this film is that peters & ritter are both victims of violent beatings in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films. this is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film.the film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by fox as the under card for double features in the theater. the sets show it is a limited budget film. the script made j edgar hoover mad because patriotism is given short shrift. hoover wanted it changed.instead, it became a b under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953. the script & acting in it are better than other big features were that year.

thelma ritter did steal the picture. i just finished watching it again. i couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene. she didn't get the oscar. that's why you shouldn't put too much faith in oscars. richard widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-d, flawed human being. jean peters was great as the streetwise, tough girl in her best role ever. and richard kiley must have been very good; why else would i have hated him so. yes, it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but, without it, you don't have much of a film. watch their faces! the top three stars didn't really need much script. i would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue. if you've ever seen ray milland and rita gam in "the thief", maybe you know what i mean. when i was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to nyc, i made my bronx uncle drive us to the foot of south street looking for no. 66. that's when i knew that hollywood couldn't be trusted. but i did find the river.i'm not giving away much of the story because i hate it when i know what happens before i see it for myself. if you have seen it, no elucidation is necessary. just maybe, someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen "pickup on south street". you will like it; just don't go looking for 66 south street in new york city.

this 1953 sam fuller movie contains some of his best work, and its sad that he couldn't continue to get the backing of major hollywood studios to do his stuff. the story line goes something like this. a tough hard broad (read prostitute) is riding the subway one hot summer day, and gets her pocketbook picked by skip mccoy. what skip (and the dame) don't realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies. this opening shot without dialogue, and mostly in tight close-ups is a beaut,one of the many that fuller uses throughout the movie. playing the babe known as candy is jean peters, who was never better nor better looking. one forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well. the pickpocket is played by richard widmark, who had already made his mark, and set his style with 1947's kiss of death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh, and although he's a little "softer" here, he's still scary. these hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty all the way. the standout performance belongs to the wonderful thelma ritter,who plays moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral. ritter received a well deserved oscar nomination for her performance, but lost out to the boring but popular performance of donna reed as the b girl (read prostitute) in "from here to eternity." hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves to oscar them even though their performance is usually awful. see for instance shirley jones in "elmer gantry. set among the docks and dives of new york city, with crisp black and white photography by the great joe macdonald,and some very good art direction. especially good is the set representing the new york city subways and widmark's shack near the river. made at the height of the cold war and red scare, the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie, played by richard kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and above all is a loyal american.

in what will probably find itself on my list of fuller's best movies (that is, once i see more of them that just this and shock corridor), pickup on south street is a film noir where the femme fatale, as well as the male protagonist, are not the stereotypical ones in the genre. like most of his other works, fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of new york style that is usually absent in the hollywood noirs. on a small budget- at least for the likes of darryl f. zanuck- fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere. the good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck. richard widmark, jean peters, and thelma ritter are all terrific in the lead parts. widmark is one only a few actors i can think of who could've really pulled off this character. he's a little like bugs bunny, as he can be a wise-ass who is a little sneaky. on the other hand, the character of skip mccoy does have a set of values in his life. he doesn't go into other people's affairs, and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river, after being sent away for three years. he slips up, unbeknownst to him, when he pickpockets a woman (peters) on the train, and lifts an item that's under the eye of the government. it may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money. but at what cost is the centerpiece of the film, as it involves stoolie moe (ritter is one of the finest, and most believable, character actors from the period), the woman's ex (a volatile kiley), and the police department.aside from the thematic elements, which are told with a keen dramatic, journalistic style (as was fuller's previous position, along with boxer), the dialog is fresh and involving. there's a spontaneity in many of fuller's camera moves. and what a third act. this is a lean, tight film-noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with fuller (it's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works).

director sam fuller has something of a cult following, particularly in europe. yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable. he did however direct one really terrific movie in "pickup on south street". made pretty early on in his career, the movies that followed were vastly inferior.from the first to the last frame, "pickup" works on all levels. it's filmed with flawless fluidity, boasting fine performances all round. richard widmark and thelma ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances, are at their peak. widmark, who was no stranger at playing villains, while truly mean to the core, still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making jean peters character's falling for him all the more credible.fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie. there is a scene in which jean peters get roughed up by widmark. it's truly shocking in its reality. this is not a case of carefully choreographed photography.less self conscious than many film noir's of the period this remains a great example of the genre.

samuel fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy, pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema.richard widmark plays a petty thief tough guy (a role he perfected over the course of many movies), who snatches a young lady's (jean peters) wallet on a new york subway and with it a piece of much-wanted microfilm. this is 1953, so of course the microfilm is property of commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back. when the girl shows up at widmark's waterfront shack, sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film, widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her "comrades" down for big money. the plot thickens, people start dying, and widmark and peters fall in love.fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction. it's as if he included a love story under duress, and so made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories so frequently were and still are in hollywood films. peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough new yawk cookie, part gangster moll and part damsel in distress. when violence occurs against her, we genuinely care about her well being, and it's typical of fuller's renegade, ahead-of-his-time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion.but the ultimate success of "pickup on south street" rests squarely on the world-weary shoulders of thelma ritter, who plays moe, a feisty lady who makes money any way she can, whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant. ritter gives the performance of her career; in a breathtaking monologue, she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character's life, and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship. it's as if every character ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies. the scene is the highlight of fuller's film, and a highlight of 50s cinema, period.grade: a+

this film is a spicy little piece of film-making from sam fuller which gives richard widmark the chance to show of some of his best, most edgy acting in the role of skip mccoy, a small-time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful candy's (jean peters) pocket on a crowded bus. it turns out candy was doing a favor for her (ex?)boyfriend, who's working for the "commies".superficially, there's a mystery here regarding candy's motives and skip spends much of the film determining her motives. actually he seems to just initially assume that she's a "commie", going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture. but the real question is  what's going on with skip? what are his motives, and why does candy like him so much? why do we (the audience) want to like him so much? basically what the film-makers have done here is create a very striking "male fatale" in widmark's character and his performance. just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like "the big sleep" or "the glass key" along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face, the film-makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers. widmark is handsome, and there's also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady, he robs her and then punches her in the face. eventually the question becomes  would skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck (his comments to the police, like "you're waving a flag at me?" make us suspect he would) or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend moe (thelma ritter)? i'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way.thelma ritter's character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here. fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of "business"  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world, particularly her used ties. another example of fuller's "business" would be the scene with victor perry (an actor i've seen elsewhere used to less effect) using the chopsticks to intimidate candy.the emphasis on moe's relationship with skip provides one of cinema's most revealing "honor among thieves" themes. in fact skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police, with the notable exception of capt. tiger (murvyn vye) who has a grudge against him. i loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack. those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is "realistic" or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions.all told, i would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the "film noir" school of film-making. a predictable plot is off-set by a host of colorful characters (uniformly well-performed), cheap sets are disguised by the film's unrelenting pace, and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is. this is the best film i've seen so far by sam fuller and helps me to see better why he's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that i think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like "the crimson kimono" and "shock corridor" as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense. this is one of my favorite performances from widmark that i've seen so far  and widmark was a talent that i'm tempted to say (based on the few extraordinary films i've seen with him) was comparable to that of alan ladd or humphrey bogart, although arguably he didn't make as many classic films.

this crime thriller is sort of like a film noir, though changes the context from post-war to cold war and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. in "pickup on south street", policemen are good guys, criminals are genuine guys, and the only enemies are "the commies", who are ultimately differentiated from the good-guys in that they are emotionally personable, driven by an actual care for their own worth, as shown in the constant tracked-in close-ups that speckle the movie.this movie revolves around characters. the personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed: skip the pick-pocket who is able to stare down any danger, and sometimes while going through their personal possessions; moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters (and the audience); candy, the ill-named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with; and joey, the ex-boyfriend evil commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and, ironically, is the worst person at doing it. throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters (such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen) and "pickup on south street" treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames.--polarisdib

'shock corridor (1963)' was my first film from samuel fuller, and there i was impressed with the director's astute blending of b-movie and big-budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock. 'pickup on south street (1953)' was released a decade earlier in fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big-name studio, twentieth century-fox. nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike dassin's 'the night and the city (1950)' and kazan's 'panic in the streets (1950)' {the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald}. in some scenes, fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye. though (unexpectedly) prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti-communist propaganda, 'pickup on south street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of new york city.when just-out-of-prison pickpocket skip mccoy (richard widmark) snags the purse of a woman on the subway (jean peters), he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for. the woman, candy, and her cowardly ex-boyfriend joey (richard kiley) had been smuggling top-secret information to the communists, and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro-film. will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder? if 'pickup on south street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti-communist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii {dwight taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'the thin man goes home (1944),' the only propagandistic movie of the series}. for no apparent reason, every identifiable character  even the smugly self-serving skip mccoy  eventually becomes a self-sacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset. in traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean.richard widmark, an actor who i'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill-ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew. the opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling bresson's 'pickpocket (1959).' thelma ritter is terrific as a tired street-woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it (though, of course, she draws the line at commies). jean peters is well-cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow-legged strut of a prostitute. nevertheless, peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism. fascinatingly, upon its release, 'pickup on south street' was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi, and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite. go figure.

from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket is at work (richard widmark) stealing from a woman's purse (jean peters), pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch. partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, the b&w photography is crisp and adds to the starkness of the story and characters, and because samuel fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like john (asphalt jungle) huston. in fact, it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrong--but the payoff is not quite as strong.jean peters is excellent as the hard-edged girl whom widmark describes as being "knocked around a lot". she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a micro-film in her purse for her boyfriend (richard kiley), something the fbi already knows about. they're on her trail when the theft occurs.thelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called "moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life. she's particularly touching in her final scene with kiley.this one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time. good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark, peters and ritter.

the only thing about this film that bums me out is that the dvd is so expensive. it's too much for my budget at the moment, or i would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and i enjoy watching richard widmark, jean peters and thelma ritter.criterion produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. that's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.the story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peters' purse. (say that three times!). everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie: widmark, the cops, the u.s. agents and the communists and, especially ritter as "moe," an informant. she and widmark are the stars of this film.peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by "falling in love" with widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. only in world of film!! too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.this an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. for that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market.

samuel fuller's pickup on south street is anomalous: a "red scare" movie devoid of hysteria, in which the communist threat is nothing more than the mcguffin that ignites the plot. pickpocket richard widmark relieves loose woman jean peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them, it harbors secrets vital to the cold war. peters, as it happens, was under surveillance by fbi agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her, cowardly comsymp richard kiley. in trying to retrieve the precious film, both sides enlist the help of thelma ritter, a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears.fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story, which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality. from the subways to the waterfront, his midsummer manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent. the love scenes between peters and widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender, and they're scored to "again," a song introduced by ida lupino in road house, also starring widmark. the pace slackens for ritter's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir, and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality. this is writer/director fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of american pathology (the crimson kimono, the naked kiss, underworld u.s.a.) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as pickup on south street.

pickup on south street (1953), directed by movie maverick samuel fuller, contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication. subway rider candy (susan peters) collides with pickpocket skip mccoy (richard widmark dipped in shades of sinatra cool). she's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; mccoy is unaware of grifting it. both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges. candy is doubly watched (skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless. they can't stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.

sam fuller's excellent pick up on south street is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's cold war-influenced low-budget noir vehicles. with a running length of under 80 minutes, pick up on south street is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining.widmark stars as pickpocket skip mccoy, who has already been picked up three times. yet mccoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble- and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster's moll candy (jean peters). candy's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the communist movement, and it's her last job for ex-boyfriend richard kiley to make the delivery. however, when widmark lifts it, peters must do whatever it takes to re-claim the film she (initially) knows nothing about.it's a tasty set-up, with widmark's character, while not the psycho of kiss of death, a real live-wire, unpredictable and tough, yet curiously charming.when bogart or mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get: a lone anti-hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end (bogart), or an overly-laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap (mitchum). with widmark you just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly modern acting style (his films always hold up well) he is amazing to watch. here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the "commies" on the right side of the law. and he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.peters gets her best role as the moll-with-a-heart-of-gold candy. widmark's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with peters; the gorgeous tramp quickly (and rather unbelievably- the romance angle is rather rushed)falls under widmark's spell, yet widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around. peters hard-edged beauty, yet lack of over-lacquered hollywood glamour (lana turner would never have worked well in this role), is a major asset to the film. candy is not innocent, yet she's very vulnerable, constantly being passed between and slapped around by men. widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face, yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her (after she cops one hell of a going-over from kiley). the scene in the hospital with peters and widmark shouldn't work, but it does.thelma ritter is brilliant as stoolie moe, well-deserving of her oscar nomination. ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is gritty, real and heartbreakingly honest. her death scene is stunning. fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. fuller loved a good close-up, and pick up on south street is full of uncomfortable, cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot. fuller isn't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard old-hollywood really allowed, yet stunningly pulls away from ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact. the urban locales and unusual, confronting camera angles give pick up on south street, a bold, uncompromisingly modern look.10/10.

this is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by sam fuller in the early 1950s. this minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier films--a cast with some stars. richard widmark, jean peters and richard kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of america--and they'll stop at nothing to succeed.the film starts with peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents. they know she is a link in a long espionage chain. unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation--a small-time pickpocket (widmark) is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that peters is carrying. widmark thinks it's just another purse he's ransacked--only later does he realize the seriousness of what he's stolen. now it's widmark on his own--with commies and the fbi hot on his trail.widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish. although she didn't get top billing, a special mention should be made of thelma ritter. this supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon. seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and i was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady.as far as the script and directing go, they are very good--but with one small exception. at first, i loved the way widmark and peters interacted. it's one of the few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth! now that's tough. later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close--too close to be believable. still, with so much great drama and such an effective noir-like film, this can be overlooked. see this film.

and anyone who watches this film will agree. this film was directed in the days when plot, character believability and theme actually mattered.jean peters, widmark, and thelma ritter steal the spotlight. ritter is in top form as informer "moe" she survives in the bowery section of ny, acting as a stool pigeon for nyc police.the only other film in which i have seen peters is "niagara", and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with brooklyn accent. widmark is appropriately menacing, as the anti-hero who must discern what the right thing is, despite his need for cash.the photography is brilliant. the neon, the subway station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!) the harbor shack where widmark lives as a transient. excellent use is made of the city, with "lightning louie" in chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10.

samuel fuller is hardly one of america's great directors. i'm not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood's great craftsmen. but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. during the time he worked for hollywood studios, he knew how to take an assignment, shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. pickup on south street is a case in point. on the surface it's one more of hollywood's early fifties' anti-commie movies, complete with appeals to patriotism, a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichés into a taut, exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. the hero, skip mccoy, is a three-time loser, a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end. the girl in the caper, candy, has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined. one of the most appealing characters, moe williams, is a stoolie. and in an unusual approach to hollywood's battle against commies, the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling. he just wants payback for a personal reason, and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy. plus, all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio. he had to make do. richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star, but jean peters is a surprise. she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb, and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. and richard kiley, who later would become a two- time tony award winning star on broadway, is convincingly slippery and cowardly. it's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us, i mean introduced to us, "the impossible dream" from man of la mancha, more than anything else, this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash, pursued by the feds and the commies, moves straight ahead with great economy. the whole enterprise, with a classic noir look, only takes 80 minutes to tell. the dialogue, with fuller as screenwriter, has that party corny, partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. "that muffin you grifted...she's okay," one character says to skip about candy. fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. then fuller throws in the character of moe williams. all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part sad inevitability. the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fuller's talents and strengths. in 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting right after the credits, fuller is able to instantly power up the movie, to establish for us what the story is about, and to show us what kind of characters -- skip and candy -- we're going to be involved with. and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot, packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us. says glenn erickson, in my opinion one of the best of movie critics, "in what should be an inconsequential story, sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked, aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it. as always in his work, the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort." he's right, and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years.

skip mccoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of candy on a subway train. what he doesn't realise is that candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations.director samuel fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of new york city. communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make pickup on south street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last. based around a dwight taylor story called blaze of glory, fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda, something that many at the time felt was over done, but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice.digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that fuller has directed, the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, a crook and a shallow human being, his heroics are not born out of love for his country, they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak. it's quite an achievement that fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s, and i'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of richard widmark as mccoy, all grin and icy cold heart, his interplay with the wonderful jean peters as candy is excellent, and is the films heart. however it is the oscar nominated thelma ritter who takes the acting honours, her moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired warmth to her that ritter conveys majestically.it's a b movie in texture but an a film in execution, pickup on south street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10

skip mccoy (richard widmark) pick-pockets candy's (jean peters) wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the communist cause. she is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact. however, skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and joey (richard kiley) and candy who want the microfiche back. skip can only be traced through moe (thelma ritter) who sells information on criminals. it is made clear to skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out for a high price. this leads to joey hunting after him and a conflict between joey and jean, who has fallen in love with skip. joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. its a well-acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away. its a bit unrealistic how jean peters immediately falls in love with widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from joey. its a good film.

every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one. this also happened in the '50's with quite a few little movies, that not a lot of people have ever heard of. there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50's that are worth digging out. "panic in the streets" is another movie like that that springs to the mind. both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources.i was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie. it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed. like all 'old' movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie.the movie has a really great story that involves espionage, though the movie doesn't start of like that. it begins as this typical crime-thriller with a touch of film-noir to it. but "pickup on south street" just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on. it ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch.i also really liked the characters within this movie. none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses. really humane. it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter, who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for. it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seen.even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!10/10

"pickup on south street" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists. the action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing. the use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality. samuel fuller's style of directing and the cinematography by joseph macdonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere.ace pickpocket and repeat offender skip mccoy (richard widmark) gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named candy (jean peters) on the new york subway. she was being used by her ex-boyfriend joey (richard kiley) to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her, she was carrying us government secrets recorded on microfilm. two fbi agents had been following candy and witnessed the theft. one of the agents continues to tail her back to joey's apartment and the other, zara (willis bouchey), visits police captain dan tiger (murvyn vye). zara explains that the fbi has been following candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group.in order to identify the pickpocket, tiger calls in a "stoolie" called moe (thelma ritter) who after being given a precise description of the "cannon's" method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects. once tiger sees skip's name on the list he's immediately convinced that he's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him. when skip is brought into tiger's office, zara tells him about the microfilm and tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co-operate with the investigation. skip is flippant and arrogant. he clearly doesn't trust tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway.joey orders candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it. candy pays moe for skip's address and when skip returns from being questioned by tiger, he finds candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money. when she recovers, skip demands payment of $25,000 for the microfilm. she tells joey about skip's demand and joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening.skip and candy are attracted to each other and it's because of their uneasy, developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police. it soon becomes apparent, however, that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action.the depictions of skip, candy and moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling.moe's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time. she appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as "an old clock running down" and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in long island. her belief that "every buck has a meaning of its own" leads her to sell any information regardless of danger, friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal. thelma ritter's performance certainly merited the oscar nomination she earned for her role.skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past, lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again. despite this, he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely, is merely philosophical when moe betrays his whereabouts and then later, he even ensures that moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly. candy is an ex-hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident. widmark and peters are both perfect for their roles and like ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction.

i really enjoyed this film. all aspects of the film were top notch including the most important, for me anyway, the screenplay and the acting. this is definitely one of richard widmark's strongest roles. he is totally convincing in his performance. just out of curiosity, imagine how humphrey bogart or robert mitchum might have tackled this role. this is my first exposure to jean peter's work that i can remember. she impressed so much here that i will definitely be on the lookout for her other work. thelma ritter, in an unglamourous role, deserved the oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. this film works on every level. the black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning. widmark and peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. strongly recommended, 9/10.

i watched this last night on tv (hbo). i have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other fn era movies. i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment. it was classic. ahh yes. the dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops! it has it all. this movie delivered all the goods to me. i especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common for this era of movie. very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days. i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the fn genre!

directed by samuel fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, pickup on south street is a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket (richard widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover richard kiley. it's film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie. as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination. its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won. this should have been the role that copped it for her!

director samuel fuller concocts a brilliant visual set-up: cocky pickpocket unwittingly lifts some microfilm from a woman's purse; it turns out she's a courier for the communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police. the film noir formula is all its glory--before the ingredients became clichés--including waterfront locales, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack, and one hell of a climactic fistfight. performances by richard widmark and jean peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is quite colorful. fabulous thelma ritter received an oscar nomination for knockout supporting role as a "professional stoolie". exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails. *** from ****

the best of the seven sam fuller movies that i've seen (including park row, run of the arrow, verboten!, shock corridor, the naked kiss, the big red one, and this film), pickup on south street counts as one of the best film noirs. it represents fuller at his most controlled. i like him when he's out of control, of course, but nearly everything in pickup is perfect. the film is absolutely beautiful. richard widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies. jean peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by richard kiley. peters is forced to find widmark and get it back. she finds him through a stool pigeon played by thelma ritter. widmark and peters are attracted to each other, which changes peters loyalties (that, and the fact that she learns she's working for communists; the cold war stuff is really interesting). the love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable, but it's not so bad that it harms the film (unlike fuller's previous film, park row). richard widmark is great. this must be one of his best roles, but i'm not so familiar with his career that i can say that for sure. thelma ritter gives the most memorable performance. her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema. i will never forget that. 10/10.

in this excellent twentieth-century fox film-noir, the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another. brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism.a prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway. it contains a microfilm, and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it. two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious information.anti-hero pickpocket skip mccoy is played with scornful assurance by richard widmark. he knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors, so he taunts them: "go on," he says to captain dan tiger (murvyn vye), "drum up a charge. throw me in. you've done it before." in this pitiless world, the cops are just one more gang on the streets. just as candy the hooker bribes lightning louie to get a lead, so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information.it is hard to believe that when widmark made this film he was already in early middle age. the 39-year-old star, coming to the end of his contract with fox, plays the upstart skip mccoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager. today it may not be acceptable for the romantic lead to punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her by sloshing beer in her face, but by the mores of the period it signified toughness - and candy, after all, is a fallen woman.jean peters is radiant as candy. here, right in the middle of her five-year burst of b-movie fame, she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart. she is the story's victim, a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else. she means well, but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men - joey, skip and the cops.the real star of this movie is new york. haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living, malevolent force. like maggots in a rotting cheese, human figures scurry through the city's byways. elevators, subway turnstiles, sidewalks - even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity. people cling to any niche that affords safety: moe has her grimy rented room, skip his tenebrous shack on the hudson river. as the characters move and interact, they are framed by bridge architecture, or lattices of girders, or are divided by hanging winch tackle. the personality of the city is constantly imposing itself. the angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan, and the card-index cabinets in the squadroom mimic the manhattan skyline. when joey's exit from the subway is barred, it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring him.a surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme close-up. character drives the plot, as it should, and the close-ups are used to augment character. when skip interrogates candy, the close-up captures the sexual energy between them, belying the hostility of skip's words. jean peters' beauty is painted in light, in exquisite soft focus close-ups. the device is also employed to heighten the tension. the opening sequence, the purse snatch, contains no dialogue: the drama relies entirely on close-up for its powerful effect.snoopers, and snoopers upon snoopers, populate the film. moe (thelma ritter) makes a living as an informant, and her place in the hierarchy is accepted, even by her victims. when skip observes, "she's gotta eat", he is chanting a recurring refrain. just as 'straight' new yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber, the underworld traffics in the commodity of information.and yet even the stool pigeons are superior to joey and his communist friends. joey's feet on moe's bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code. joey is beyond the pale. moe will not trade with joey, even to preserve her life: " ... even in our crummy business, you gotta draw the line somewhere.""pick-up" was made in the depths of the cold war. richard nixon had just been chosen as the republican vice-presidential candidate, having made his name with his phoney alger hiss expose - bogus communist microfilm and all. the mccarthy show trials were a daily reality. we see the cops in the movie inveigh against "the traitors who gave stalin the a-bomb".new york can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats, squeals and murders. containers form a leitmotif throughout the film. moe carries her trade mark box of ties, and candy's purse, container of the microfilm, is the engine of the plot. skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate, symbolising his secretive street-wisdom. the paupers' coffins, moving down the hudson on a barge, are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis.the film is a masterpiece of composition. candy is shown above the skulking skip on the rickety gangway of the shack, signifying her moral ascendancy. when the gun is placed on the table, the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than candy - violence is beginning to dwarf compassion. the lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore's hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city. enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall, or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke. he is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage - a predatory phantom of the night. camera shots from under taxi hoods, inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis. we are civilisation's mulch.

pickup on south street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. an example of the directing: when candy (jean peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. it's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just "clicks" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.richard widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for "moe," the street peddler/informer, played by thelma ritter. later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. i've never seen anyone "act" so real i felt like i was looking into a real room until ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat. about a million other things just *worked,* from the way lightning louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks moe's hand away from her brooch, to the way moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the fbi guy's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet, like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years. "pickup on south street" is detailed moves (directing) with consummate performances (acting) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the shack out on the water, the dumbwaiter, -- and the unforgettable place skip stashes his pocket pickings. wonderful stuff."pickup on south street" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: skip as a "three-time loser" and candy as a youngish woman who has "knocked around" a lot. when these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human.

while returning from a christmas eve shopping trip, an abused suburban housewife (basinger) finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths takes a violent turn.suffering the indignity of a straight to dvd release here in the u.k., susan montford's directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves. this is a shame, as the standard of the writing, directing and acting is very good indeed, and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to dvd flick.kim basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband (craig sheffer). while sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence, it is in their brief scenes together that basinger connects - showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths. it's a truly great, understated performance, her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played.lukas haas i initially thought was miscast, as he (along with the other three youths) just did not seem much of a threat. however, had all four youths been more physically imposing, the later scenes in which basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all. the fact that these are four average men, albeit slightly unhinged, is the key to why the film works as well as it does.apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over. some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes, or the abrupt ending. others by the at times brutal violence. i say give it a chance, it's certainly more deserving of your time than saw v.

in all my 60 years of age, i have learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification (whether we want it or not) implicit with an specific character.sometimes because the character executes certain gesture, sometimes because the character speaks determinate word, or sentence  that we use or that we would like to use  in determinate situation.the movie in question, should be seen by this point of view. who now find a parking space  in a mall,downtown, or in the street - taken by a car whose driver can't remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world?who hasn't the urge to "rubber out" the ill mannered spat?haven said that i ask: - did you identify with della (played by kim bassinger)? if your answer is: yes!, then try not to find absurd details  comparatively with life's reality  in the movie, because you'll certainly find the movie ridiculous.abstractions made, you will see that the movie has moments of surprise, such as: 1- in the sequence in which della grabs the box of tools in the trunk (does that box contains a gun, and does she haves the guts to use it?); 2- in the sequence in which terry dies whilst falling; 3- in the sequence in which della gets attracted by chuckie's "mermaid's call".if you have already seen the movie, or if are planning seeing, keep in mind that there are "realistic" movies, "fiction" movies, "political" movies, and movies in which you can "wash your soul" to exemplify the last one, we can quote: "tropa de elite".according to newspaper's , there was unanimous applause when bope officials take certain attitudes. (as i have seen the movie in dvd, i could not ascertain the audience's reaction)as for the direction part (susan monford), interpretations (kim bassinger, lukas haas, craig scheffer, etc. edition (william m. anderson  'dead poets society', 'green card'  exceptional edition, 'robocop 2', etc. it is well situated in context. in a scale of 1(awful) to 10(master piece), i rate "when she was out" a 7(regular).

kim basinger stars as della, a housewife who has twin children (terri and tammi-played by luke gair and erika-shaye gair) and an abusive jerk for a husband (kenneth), played by craig sheffer.the movie opens on christmas eve. kenneth is on his way home from work, driving a nice car too i might add. he is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner i would assume. when he gets home, he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about. this angers him even more and he takes up with his wife, della, asking her why the house is always a mess. he pins her up against the wall. the twin's watch from the stairs. he punches the wall, leaving a hole in it and walks away. she tends to the children, trying to comfort them. after that is all said in done, she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper. she gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute shoppers there. while she is looking for a parking space, she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her. she finally finds a spot to park, makes her way over to the hoggish car and leaves a note under the wiper calling the owner a "selfish jerk". then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping.when she finally does leave the mall, it is closing and many people have left already. not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle. she also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there. odd. when she gets to her vehicle, she gets in to start it up. she notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up. she gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car (chuckie-played by lukas haas) she left the note on and a posse of his thug friends. yelling ensues and a mall cop (no, not paul blart) makes his way over to them to see what the problem is, only to have his brains blown out of his head by chuckie. while this happens, della jumps in her vehicle, starts it and drives over the median in front of her. chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase. della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed. she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle, open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox before the thugs get there. with that, della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons. the first kill, in my opinion, is the best. the first kill that della performs anyway. the last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing. i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself. as a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it's 1 hour and 20 minute run time.

the story: on the island texel, photographer bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious kathleen. her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. her life is not so simple as it seems, however. through kathleen, bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. will kathleen be able to win his trust?review: the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's 'psychology' would have been worked out a little more. why do these people do the things they do? what motivates their choices? this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. the story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. so you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level. the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'believable' way, but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character's naiveness doesn't quite work for a grown-up woman. camera-work is nice, and there are some great shots of the nature on the island. i give the movie a 7/10.

this is an excellent film and one should not be put off by its strangeness. there is genuine skill in manufacture of this work. it manages to be intrigiung, funny and frightening at various times. work with it for the first few minutes and you won't be disappointed

an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind? is he just getting old? the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on. there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. you knew what was going on and i liked it.the other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter. those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear. he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that, it was a pretty deep movie.

the premise of the story is simple: an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child, and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred. though very little dialog is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told by the camera's eye alone made the film quite engaging. the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness, which complements the quietness of the characters themselves. we can also sense helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which parallels the silenced child's inability to tell her own story.true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and irrationality. this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak.cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments. the ending is also unexpected and believable. reminiscent of japanese horror films, such as "the ring," and "dark water," or english horror films, such as "lady in black," and "the innocents," this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror. i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try.by the way, if you haven't seen the films i just mentioned above, you might want to give them a try as well.

don't be swayed by the naysayers. this is a wonderfully spooky film. this was a thesis project for the writer/director , jt petty. he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat. i never really knew what to expect, and for a jaded horror-movie goer, this is nirvana! the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods. one day, while searching for his cat in the woods, he witnesses the murder of a child, or does he? he agonizes about this the rest of the film. what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes. i found this to be intriguing. the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug. give this film a go, you won't be disappointed.

i really think i should make my case and have every(horror and or cult)movie-buff go and see this movie...i did!it-is-excellent: very atmospheric and unsettling and scary...incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low(read-"no"!)-budget they had....synopsis taken from website: "one morning, an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat. he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse..."on this website(imdb) there is no trailer, but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out...www.softfordigging.com

virgil manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse.chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property,manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods.he reports the crime to the police but there's no body to be found.troubled by disturbing visions,he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn"soft for digging" is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare.this minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue.some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent.the location sets provide plenty of creepiness:the eerie maryland woods rival those used in "the blair witch projcect".give this strange horror film a chance.9 out of 10.

i think that people are under estimating this incredible film. people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep. which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton. this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film.the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting, a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this. but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece...that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining.

as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 (mbb bo 105) flight scenes in this movie. one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod, in this case an inert rb 75 (maverick) missile painted black with the letters "ews 39" in white along the side. real jammer pods definitely do not look like that, at least not the ones i've seen.but apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending (the last minute). anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units, including the now-legendary ssg, on film should see this one.

i did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility. the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies. this may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future.

i think this movie is well done and realistic. i you are used to watching hollywood "action" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. this movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what hollywood can produce, and that is what lifts it above the average action movie. i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. but as i have seen the "making of" extra i'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch. high quality realistic story and movie.

in lizzie borden's "love crimes" (1992), sean young plays a gritty d.a. in atlanta. she's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man (patrick bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes compromising photos of them, then leaves them.naturally, this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbug's life by posing as his prey, intending to bring him to justice. they meet, they make love, then the next thing she knows, she is over his lap, getting spanked. (note: the spanking scene is only in the "unrated" version of this film. the r-rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid.) this psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images, such as bergin chasing one of his victims around the room, flailing at her with a riding crop.as a thriller, "love crimes" is at its best when sean young is playing her cat-and-mouse game with bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. it's unfortunate that the film doesn't end, it just stops. that's true. director lizzie borden may have just run out of story to tell, but after 92 minutes the credits roll, and we are left with a puzzling "what just happened?" bewilderment.the unfolding of young's plan is played out in engaging style, but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn-off for some viewers.dan (daneldorado@yahoo.com)

this is by far my favorite film of all time. that's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. however, i don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. sean young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. the other cast members do a fine job as well.have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? have you ever wondered why? the obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. it seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like "love crimes". sadly, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it could probably not be made today.

lizzie borden's love crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which sure beats the male kind). it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory.this treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust.one striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. he shoves a riding crop between her legs, pressing it against her crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement.then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door.patrick bergin plays the con artist, and though he falls a long distance from handsome, he picks on plain janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line. by all reports, sean young proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful. yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. her performance is forceful and complex.borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate.

trapped: buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened, and is soon to close.we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow, that doesn't make sense. anyways, he's about to blow away one particularly big one, when he notices the resort is open. despite his best efforts, higher authority tells him his day is over.soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche hits.look, i'm not gonna reveal any more, all i can say is this was a b-movie designed for the family channel (which i just saw it on, and the fact it had no commercials proves it's a b-movie) anyways, it's a pretty decent film, but it's partially unreal.firsthand, when people are buried by ice and snow, they're buried. not just traced by powder. or, what about a cd for a screwdriver? it's not possible. and finally, what i can't stress enough, is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche, guaranteed.furthermore, it's worth a rental or a tv viewing, but not owning. 7/10.the movie is rated pg, but maybe it should have received something a little more strong. a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, dead people are laying around.enjoy.

despite the lack of logic present in the storyline, kill shot is a highly enjoyable film. through a moving performance kasper van dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son. each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance, highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name i cannot recall. a shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers, but as a whole kill shot truly delivers a death blow.

this movie's origins are a mystery to me, as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it. i assume that before "starship troopers", "killshot" was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network, cable, or otherwise. the new title of "kill shot" is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. the quick cuts, cheesy "melrose place" music, and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for.and i don't mind at all. i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but that's another review). after looking it up on imdb, my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career (see bond-girl and wild things references here). they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r-rated status - coveted in suspense video rental sections, that is. in any event, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section.all in all, it's entertaining. i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot, though. that was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show, the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual.would i rent it again? no. would i watch this tv show? well, why not - it's better than baywatch. and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. token black guy (who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter-racial dating), token asian (japanese, i assume from the name koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account - this show probably would have done ok.but as a movie it just cracks me.i gave it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. it made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all i ask of rentals.

i was pleasantly surprised i quite liked this movie. witty writing (some "inside" jokes i got, others i didn't - maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another), great acting (notably john cassini), great cameos, interesting and unique directing. i rented it to see jeffrey meek (very disappointed he was in it such a short time, blink and you'll miss him!) but found the movie remarkably entertaining. i'll actually watch it again before i send back to netflix. i think actors and wanna-be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie. the ending is somewhat expected but wish they'd done something different (and more positive). too bad the movie wasn't better received except for in the "festival" market. i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz.

after seeing 'break a leg' in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable film.i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos (eric roberts in particular) were a scream. i haven't heard word about actual release date although i've heard it's close.the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations. the script is smooth and seamless, the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh. this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it's been in, which is around 10 - 15 or so.i highly recommend 'break a leg'.

a struggling actor finds the best way to break into hollywood is to start knocking off the competition. but what makes break a leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling (and not so) la actor. it brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit. it's also got a polished look and very adept direction under monika mitchell. break a leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn't compromise its production values at any level. the writing is tight, the dialogue first rate. cassini is an actor's actor, and the role really shows off his talents. the climactic scene between him and rene garcia is an instant classic, and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time. i saw it at an advanced screening, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards.

unlike other commentaries, i found this film fascinating, even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors.being a technologist, i found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic, experiments are being conducted now to do just this. i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage, with results so far not favorable.the characters in the movie are well cast. the girl, although overacting a bit, looks suitable dumb. the truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers. the minister conveys doubt at first, (the principal investigator tells the minister that him (the minister), is not sure whether he believes that god created man or that man created god. but the minute when the chips are down, he falls back on his faith. only the phd plays the zombie. the secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters. in the face of death they react as real human beings would.the movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by government. as strictly a thriller, the movie does not have enough thrills. as a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinnings it is fascinating.

this is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal. it has this hazy overtone that is rarely captured on film, it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark haunting memory. the kids were extremely believable and i do expect some things to come of them in the future. very natural acting for such young ones, i don't know if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good, but no the less excellent. bill scored as far as i'm concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr. paxtons bad acting, what can one do in that role. he played the part rather well in my opinion. this is coming from someone who said hamlet was good (the ethan hawke version?) wow......... do not listen to his comments. great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable, if that's what you want? cinematography gets an above the average rating also.

i rented this movie and watched it 20 times before i took it back to the store. bill paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. the story is original and well written. powers booth and paxton both deliver good performances. the story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back, then spots in the present, alternating back and forth. this style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can't get dull. bill paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!

frailty--8/10--it's non-sensical title and "bill paxton directs" headline aside, this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller. in the end, it may end up only being the inbred southern gothic cousin of kubrick's "the shining"---but hey, that's a pretty damn entertaining notion. it's also got a doozy of a plot twist...and a very ambiguous moral message. this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it. too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to star...oh well....still a devil of a good rent.

my husband and i just got done watching this movie. i was not expecting it to be this good! i was really astonished at how great the story line was. i'm usually very good at figuring out twisty plots...but this one had me. i loved it! i'm going to have to watch it again before i take it back. i might even have to buy it. :)

i couldn't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was. the screenplay is highly intelligent and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more reminiscent of seven. not by changing the story - i think mainly through the cinematography. the cinematography was the only thing that i found to be holding back the film. on the other hand, the pacing was absolutely on point. whoever worked on the editing really did their job well. and i thought bill paxton did a great job of directing. now away from the technical stuff...this movie threw me for a loop. spoiler ahead!!!! all along, i really felt that bill paxton was crazy and then when adam finally took the fbi agent to the rose garden to show him where the bodies were buried and revealed who he was, i got thrown for a loop. i had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too (without any words spoken, simply by touch) sees it again with adam and asks him how he knew. my dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost ungraspable idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out 'bad guys' so to speak, knowing their sins and crimes already. i don't endorse an eye for an eye so i didn't leave the film being able to believe that they were doing god's work. instead i chose to believe that they were both clairvoyant and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to, disturbed them permanently also. that was my interpretation but the vexing thing about the film was it's like a house of cards and a never-ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you've sat through. it's definitely one of those movies where i'd love to be able to meet the writer so i could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all. were they crazy and psychotic? were they simply telepathic and took license because of it? or did they have some sort of appearance from god? and if so, was it god or the devil disguising himself as god. my friends and i found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie.a definitely perplexing and thought invoking film with some very disturbing but certainly not sensationalistic elements to it. it's not a perfect film, but it definitely is it's own thing. great directorial work and acting by bill paxton and the child that played fenton was extremely good. i hope he doesn't end up relegated to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise. i gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film, but i would have voted higher if wasn't for the feeling that something (although i can't pinpoint what) was off and if it hadn't have been, the movie would have gone to an even higher level. still, a definite recommend, especially for those that are inquisitive.

man, some of you people have got to chill. this movie was artistic genius. instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction? a story. entertainment, for god's sake (no pun intended). it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics--and they're not doing to well. i'm so impressed by the movie and bill paxton's job at directing, that i'm going to contact him personally to tell him. ya know, if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line, you might just enjoy the film. me and all of my friends did!

this is a great movie that everyone should see. it plays like a dean koontz book.bill paxton's performance was great in that it really seems like he believes in what he is saying and doing.i don't know why viewers have to read in some kind of advocacy for religious murder in to the film. it is fiction. the ending is surprising, but fictional. so what? i think that is what makes this movie so good. spoiler do not read further if you havent seen the movie. throughout the movie, the viewer is continually shocked at the sickness of paxton's character, the impact on the children, and the way the children handle this outrageous conduct. and then at the end, it turns out to be true. god has put him on a mission to rid the world of demons. paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. sure, he is given info that he couldn't have known otherwise, but the movie goes further to show how god is "protecting" adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the second fbi agent. the film isn't advocating christian murder, it is merely taking the viewer on a very unexpected ride.

i gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors and my god the enging! the thing is i don't want to tell anyone anything about the acting or story because it will ruin the movie. but i will recommend that you go straight to your nearest moviestore right now and rent it! (don't forget popcorn!)

it's really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed. but i'm glad i did not miss it.they should re-release it with a lot more publicity. i do not think they did anything to promote it. great work paxton.

i went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack-and-slash films rampant on the screen these days. boy, was i surprised. this little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber, dark atmosphere. more surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. as with most good movies, this one leaves something to the imagination, and bill paxton did a superb job at directing. scenes shot inside the car as are well done and, after watching the "anatomy of a scene" episode at the end of the video tape, it was good to see that some of the subtle, yet wonderful things i had noticed were intentional and not just an "oh, that looks good, keep it" type of direction. this is a moody movie, filled with grimness. still, for the dark subject, a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes. the acting is exceptional (okay, i've always been a fan of powers booth), and never goes over the top. au contraire, it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film. if there is any one area where this film lacks, it is in the ending, which seems just a bit too contrived, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie. what is the message? it's something that each individual decides for themself. overall, on the 1-10 scale, this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre (ie: "body heat" or "midnight in the garden of good and evil"), and about a 5 for those who don't.

something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. it was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of hollywood every month.i saw this movie on video because i did not even know about it before i saw it at my local video store. if you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. the suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent.

this movie is beautifully designed! there are no flaws. not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. the script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission.paxton is at his best in this role. his mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue. each shot meticulously done! surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. this may not be the best picture of the year, but it's a gem that has been very well polished. it's not for the simple mind.

the movie "frailty" is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film. it has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not. "frailty" is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong.in "frailty", a middle-aged father (bill paxton) and his two sons claim to be doing the work of god. it turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called "god's hands". we watch the father kill the "demons" in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work god and that what they are doing is right. he claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth. god has given him a list of names and in return for his "services"; he and his sons will be given protection, which basically means the police will never be able to capture them. we see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner. but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons, particularly the oldest son, adam. adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being, that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that. he knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother, fenton. fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything in as if it were his own religion. he seems trapped in his father's world of god and demons. i suppose this is because he's so young and easily impressionable. but everything that happens to these three is rather convincing, in fact, too convincing. the events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters. i say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see god. dad first sees the murders as his mission. his "mission" eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons. in fact, his hallucination is the primary one. his "orders" and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination. watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where i am coming from. fenton, the younger son, is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction. since he is so young, it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap. adam, on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions. ***spoilers*** in a way, the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie. (i will not say how or under what circumstances). but i will say that it is not pleasant. after his death, it fast-forwards to the present day. (the story is being told through flashbacks, as seen through the eyes of the oldest son adam). in actuality, it is fenton that is telling the story, not adam as originally believed. the story is being told the way he perceived it, through his actions and his brother's actions. fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the fbi agent into his trap.since religion is a major theme in this movie, the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it. before dad discovered his newfound mission, he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. his sons fenton and adam often sang innocent little children's church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant. after the revelation of dad's newfound mission, they both took off in separate directions - adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness. a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you, do not watch it alone.

this is one of those movies that, after watching it, you will keep thinking about and coming back to even months after viewing. the acting is spectacular for starring two children (i usually hate movies with whiny kid acting). bill paxton is awesome, his directorial debut is even better than what i expected of an actor whose most memorable line is "game over, man! game over!" (from the movie "aliens").the best part about the movie is the dichotomy between those scenes where the actors play a family, and when they are doing their "work." it really makes the movie believable and memorable.keep it up, bill. i'll be waiting for more movies i"m sure to love!

frailty is a non-gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion/obsession straight into depravity. dad (we never learn his name) is a gentle man and loving father who's raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son, adam. the family's world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys' room and tells them god has given him a vision. and what a vision  the entire family's job is to destroy demons, who, of course, are disguised in human form.proceeding from this premise, the movie is unflinching in following it. dad kidnaps people/demons whom god has told him to destroy, binds them, lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil, then kills them  while making his young sons watch. fenton, the older boy, is horrified, seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer. adam, the younger, is uncomfortable, but trusts that dad is following god's will. eventually, dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the "demons" that god has put on dad's list, and finally, invites them to fully participate in god's mission for the family.this is not, you understand, an abusive father. he loves his children. he is only following god's instructions: "this is our job now, son. we've got to do this." when fenton, terrified and convinced his father has gone mad, says he'll report him to the police, his father explains, "if you do that, son, i'll die. the angel was clear on this." the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic, and warps their entire lives.(1) the movie's structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects: a story in flashback, told in a police station to a fbi agent. the moody lighting, the stormy weather, and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory. i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story, until i remembered the real-life parallel of andrea yates, who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them. even then, i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy, rather than a story of divine retribution.the movie gave me no such comfort, though, as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad's vision. and this, as much as some plot holes, posed a problem for me. regardless of the accuracy of dad's visions, regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed, where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death? (1) roger ebert review, 4/12/02

mcconaughey in a horror/thriller? i had to see this. i was pleasantly surprised.the plot is told in flashback mode, and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament. i can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie, sorry. just know that if you decide to watch it, you'll be, in the very least, surprised.all the main players are very good. bill paxton did a great job directing those kids, and his acting is awesome. mcconaughey's acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly.this movie challenges you to think. is dad crazy? is there a god? do demons exist? how far would you go to right a wrong. and what is "right" anyway? i'm still thinking.and thus i recommend "frailty". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second, or even third viewing.

bill paxton, of aliens, near dark, and terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as director for frailty. he hits on all cylinders, but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the fbi agent (powers booth) which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller. other than that, this movie was just fine.bill paxton plays dad. he's never given a first name, but that is not a weakness of the film. it in fact strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind. he has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons fenton meiks(matt oleary) and adam meiks (jeremy sumpter) must fine the demons and kill them. the demons look like normal people which they kill, and this makes the viewer wonder if dad has just lost his mind, or is he really doing god's work. there are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense.the story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up (matthew mcconaughey) and is speaking with fbi agent wesley doyle (powers booth) who is very skeptical and rightfully so. after all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.the film has many twists, and bill paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest. the acting is incredible. the two young leads and paxton work great together, looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder. like i said there is the one implausibility involving powers booth's character, but it really isn't a big thing. this was an extremely well made film involving faith and family.

this could be the most underrated movie of its genre. i don't remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn't do so well at the box office. however, frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie. i rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list.movie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself "god's hand". and then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case. during that trip, the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. fenton and adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he has received a divine message from god asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings. he receives from god a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission.this is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. the tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are questioned. it has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end. if you like this genre, i highly recommend frailty for you. i own the dvd and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers.

what a real treat and quite unexpected. this is what a real thriller movie is all about. i rushed into the video shop, grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best. i was totally surprised and delighted. i really enjoyed the actors and their characters. i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic. the plot was well thought out,well written and directed. it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minute.i highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers, especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention. definitely a 10 out of 10 from me.

stunning. absolutely stunning. this is a movie about two kids who's father suddenly has a vision. he claims an angel visits him, and tells him that they need to kill "demons". he gets instructions later, and they start rounding up the demons, which are, to the naked eye, ordinary people. they kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head, and chop them up, burying them in the rose-garden. their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. the movie continues, with a twist at the end.the thing that i love about this movie, is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception. is their father completely mad? or, is he telling the truth? the audience is left to decide. go make the judgment for yourself, and see the movie. now.

i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day, after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven. not really a fan of either star, i still wanted to see it because i'm a huge thriller fan.i was not disappointed. the acting was superb, especially from the two young boys. usually i loathe child actors, but young adam and young fenton were excellent. bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too. it was beautifully shot.one must also note the plot twists. the three twists at the end hit hard and fast, and i didn't see them coming. the final twist of the film, coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though i've re-watched the film so many times.a true gem.

matthew mcconaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent wesley doyle (powers boothe) in his fbi office. he claims to have information about a serial killer chased by fbi. when agent doyle arrives in the office, he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. agent doyle requests some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood. they were a simple family of three: his widow father meiks (bill paxton), his brother and himself. one night, his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of god had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons. what happens next is one of the most scary movie i have ever seen. i watched this movie four months ago on vhs, and yesterday i watched again, now on dvd. although being a low-budget movie, the screenplay is sharp, with no flaw. the cast is outstanding, but i would like to highlight the performance of matt o'leary as the young felton. it is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. the direction of bill paxton is remarkable. there is no explicit violence in this horror movie. a great debut behind the camera. i regret the brazilian title of this movie: 'a mão do diabo' (the devil's hand'). if at least it were 'the god's hand', it might be acceptable. but calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous. brent hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from the brazilian distributor. this film is highly recommended. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "a mão do diabo" ("the devil's hand")

the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect. it's a very good thriller. well shot. tough to believe it was bill paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version. still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton. it's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists. the child actors in the movie do a great, too. i'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a good job.this movie is not gory. it's not very scary. but it is very, very creepy.

a very promising directorial debut for bill paxton. a very dark thriller/who-really-done-it recommended by stephen king. this is a strong, well-conceived horror tale about a devout, but demented man in thurman, texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from god to eliminate demons trying to control mankind. a couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth. most of the violence you don't really see, but still enough to double up your stomach.director paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the hand of god killer. matthew mcconaughey is equally impressive as the demented man's eldest son that ends up telling this story to a dallas fbi agent(powers boothe). boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. suspenseful white knuckler! highly recommended.

bill paxton stars in and directs this highly original film. having watched the first time i was by how good it was. the reviews i had heard were ok . as a result i was expecting an average thriller at most .however because of paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching , especially if you are a horror film fanatic.the film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits . the films strongest point is the storyline which i have to say is highly original and is like i have ever seen before. well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys. i give this film 9/10 and i highly recommend that everyone catches it.

the film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder, one simply cannot go wrong. the very plot in itself, the very story and essence of the film, is entertaining. it is the sort of story that the director (bill paxton) could do so much with, and in this case, he really did do a lot with it.from beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity that is behind this story is first class. i felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly, quickly, and tightly from one scene to the next. it demonstrates just how far people can go: so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such acts of evil, in the name of 'god' when they are disillusioned as in this case. it also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole.overall, this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks, but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time.

there is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that i hit a gem with this one. from beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top marks.father of two sons hears messages from "god" to kill people who he is told are 'demons'.when the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film; exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non-stop from beginning to end.and there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub-plots, and the script is first class. all the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional. this film is at least as good as the likes of 'silence of the lambs'.

actor paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling, dark, and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic (paxton himself) who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but "demons", and that they have been selected by god to destroy these "demons". this is all told in flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (matthew mcconaughey) to skeptical fbi agent (powers boothe).hard to automatically forget this film; better than most serial killer features, it's a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks. paxton, commendably, barely shows any blood at all until near the end. well acted by all, especially the two child actors (jeremy sumpter of the recent "peter pan" and matt o'leary of "spy kids 2" and "domestic disturbance"). the only reason i deducted any points at all is because i can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach. in any event, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script.8/10

this is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders. the storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in texas, us who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by god to redeem the world of bad people.bill paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged father who is known as the hand of god killer while matthew mcconaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son, fenton meiks. the film revolves around fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to fbi agent wesley doyle (played by powers boothe).i cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. even if you want to stop watching, you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie.the directors have filmed this movie very well, and they help to set the plot through the good scenery. the acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people.whilst the concept of this film is very dark, the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting. this really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout. i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different.8/10

i had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it. when a widowed father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing him and not. as the horrifying events of this tale unfold, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons, and about their destinies. with shocking twist after shocking twist, this film never allows for a lull in the plot. bill paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances are that of his older son, fenton, played by matthew o'leary and his younger son, adam, played by jeremy sumpter. this is one of the best thrillers that i have seen in a while, and you will want to watch this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. i give this film a 9/10.

the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland, winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead. michael gaffikin (james warwick) a former paratrooper in the british army, is the local dentist, he's not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson (celia imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip(maurice roëves) at the islands police station, inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp, dr goudry, for closer inspection. a quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. over dinner that night with michael gaffikin, fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one colonel howard (jonathan newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength, one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer, another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain. with a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn't work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. reports of ufo's and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin's idea that aliens might be involved, but a rise in radioactive levels on the island, has him doubting himself.the nightmare man is based on the novel, child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire, it is here adapted by dr who and blake's 7 scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci/fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. the nightmare man though is on the whole, a succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down to the minor characters, time is given to giving them all a firm background. the island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over, but its one that i enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama, but credit to camfield, he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. there is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point. if there is one negative about the killer its that, we are given his/her/its pov for the killings, an acceptable cliché on its own, but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens, it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer, given the clues presented, but it's a fun and very well acted piece. the local scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. imrie, never one i've taken to in other works, is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production. the outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, it disappointed me in some ways, but taking into account when it was made, its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it, is even more terrifying.

i started to watch this movie expecting nothing, just another movie to watch, but since the first twenty minutes, the artwork and main character, who is enigmatic, doesn't talk much, really got me in this movie.i really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully acted and really touching. it's a bit slow but the immersion was complete. the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars. the music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes. the ending was unexpected with a twist i didn't see coming. it's not the kind of movie we see often.

this movie really surprised me. i had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute. it is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and husband. if you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you. the storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes, but in the end i think it made everything better. the ending was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it would end otherwise. as for the acting i think it was good. it will not be up for an oscar award for long but it at least caught my eye. gil bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very entertaining. shaun parkes portrait of bellows prison mate clinique is great and extremely powerful. on the downside i think i will put esai morales portrait of markie.take my advice and watch this movie, either you will love it or dislike it!

a true dark noir movie and a very graphic film, nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption, that may have just left it all too late. visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget. full marks to gareth maxwell roberts and team, i look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more british actors would be great. lisa ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future. subject all interesting sex,drugs and violence. bring it on. i would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you're in the mood for a semi moody noir.

another excellent arnold movie. this futuristic movie has great action in it, and is one of arnie's best movies. arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death. this movie is excellent and a great sci-fi / action movie. i've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! perfection

the running man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks.in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary, post 1980s-boom. forget that though! there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film.schwarzenegger is on top form as ben "the butcher of bakersfield" richards, and the inclusion of bond-belting one liners was completely inspired-thety are truly leg-end-dary (with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight).the design of the stalkers is authentically american, and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc 'gladiators' tv show, and the wwe as well. buzz-saw's grisly end will chill any viewer to the core (as a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour?)jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle (and are arnies buds in real life), and its even got mick fleetwood in it too! what more could you ask for?i highly recommend the running man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action, with a glossty finish and some great characters. just don't expect an education from it (at least on surface value).quality, i bloody love it actually. you will too unless you're a thesp. 7/10

i have seen the running man several times as i am a stephen king fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago i didn't know about this website and i didn't realize that the paul michael glaser that was involved with this movie was the same paul michael glaser that i grow up watching on starsky and hutch television show. for me this is a pleasant surprise because i can't tell you how many times i cried when starsky or hutch got hurt. the episode where starsky (kill starsky) almost died i cried so hard my dad had to turn away from the show. what to you expect of a kid at age 12. now, i intentionally look for films and programs involving paul or david soul and anything that stephen king has his hands on i'm so there!!!!!!!! just got to say happy birthday paul!!!!!

although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my dvd rack and i don't know why. i think i like it because the moral of the story is 'television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life'. for those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book, its nothing like the film at all. to ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building, killing himself, everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time. i read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9/11.

this is an arnold movie. now that you know that, i've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review. if you don't like arnold, then you wont like this movie. if the case is the other, then you will very probably like it. it's as simple as that.now, if you're still reading this i expect you like arnold. good for you! he is quite good isn't he. the running man is a very typical arnold feature. it's got the usual retro-future we know so well from 80's b-sci fi, it's got a bunch of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending.in this case, the evil opponent is the all-controlling 1984ish government, which uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows. arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down, with a little help from his two confederates and the good-looking amber.it's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it. it's hopelessly 80's, but i find that charming. acting is varying, arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing, with a helping of stone-faced one-liners. heroine amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named damen killian is a typical evil tv man.in spite of all it's flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. it also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience. this does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming.if you've seen arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one. enjoy.

set in 2017 (although one might easily mistake it for 1987, judging by the hairstyles and clothing), the running man sees all-round good guy ben richards (schwarzeneggar) framed for a crime he didn't commit. after a daring prison break, he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal tv game show the running man, along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female, amber (maria conchita alonso),.used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses, the show pits convicts against a range of colourful (and often quite camp) opponents, each having his own unique killing style: dynamo fires electricity from a special suit, buzzsaw uses chainsaws, sub zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick, and fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders. but these killers are no match for ben richards, who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner (followed by the obligatory witticism).towards the end of the movie, ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host, killian.twenty years ago, arnold schwarzeneggar ruled the action-movie universe and, to his legion of fans, he could do no wrong. the austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies: comic book violence plus logic-free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one-liners, minus acting ability equalled massive profits. the running man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a t and arnie's (mostly male teenage) audience lapped it up (myself included).now, two decades later, and having just finished re-watching the movie for the first time in years, i find it a strange movie: one totally devoid of technical merit, decent acting, and convincing effects, yet somehow totally entertaining. directed by paul michael glaser (best known as det. dave starsky from cult 70s cop show, starsky and hutch), and adapted from a short story by stephen king (writing under the nom de plume, richard bachman), the running man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated, yet despite (or maybe because of) the film's shoddiness, it has a special charm which is hard to describe.with no attempt at creating a realistic near-future setting, the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles. check out the scene in which ben discovers amber's secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes(!); marvel at the crap 'futuristic' graphics used on advertising billboards and the running man board game (as a graphic designer, i found these particularly amusing); be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements.the running man may be utter rubbish, but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that i have no hesitation in recommending to fans of arnie and sci-fi action in general.

why didn't dynamo have any pants?! where did they go?? it was never explained. that's why this movie was so awesome. plus starsky gave his kids the aids!!!! great acting too. richard dawson deserved to win best supporting actor! a i d s my favorite line from the movie was "that hit the spot" a i d s. this movie was for the "birds". i tried to give this movie the "stinkeye" but it continued playing. what am i doing wrong???!!!! i thought the "hateboat" was funnnny lol ;) i would like that for a show. why wasn't dynamo wearing pants. i know his arm was skewered but... what's up with those crazy futur nets. why didn't that family feud guy ray combs get a net?? he could have used one. aidsssss

running man viciously lampoons the modern-day american media complex, and hits its target dead-center. it may be an easy target, but they pull it off none the less. rm effortless takes on pro-wrestling (featuring some pro wrestlers as the hunters), network television, the nielsen ratings, the american government (suggesting it's entertainment-oriented anyway), crime & punishment, and a half-dozen other things along the way. it's a far cry from the original stephen king novella, and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either. but who cares? it's basically a arnie flick, with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-liners such an undertaking requires.

running man isn't a great movie, in fact it's kinda silly. but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment. i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture, it's so silly and over the top, that it almost makes fun of itself. by the way, this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there.

this comic book style film is funny, has nicely paced action and a great futuristic style to it. writer steven de souza, who also wrote commando, gives arnie plenty of lines to dish out: "send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a pen into the lawyers back; "what a pain in the neck," after strangling subzero with barbed wire; "he had to split," after slicing his body between his legs; and finally, as killian slams through a billboard bearing his own face, arnie concludes, "now that hit the spot." funnily enough, bears some similarities total recall, another sci-fi flick starring schwarzenegger.

this is one of the great movies of the 80s in my collection that i think about all the time. the running man is one of arnold`s best and most different films even to this day and when i first saw the running man i was so excited to see a movie like this. i just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie. it also has jesse ventura, the legendary professor toru tanaka, sven-ole thorsen, the beautiful maria conchita alonso, yaphet kotto, kurt fuller, richard dawson, and thomas rosales jr. who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as universal solder, the lost world, robo cop 2, predator 2, and among others. all arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed, star filled, and its one its one of arnold`s best to date!

didn't mystic pizza win the oscar for that year? this movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why i felt that way upon leaving the theater. only "wargames" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling i was getting a glimpse of our future. history has shown that this is exactly what happened.the casting is a pop-culture cuisinart of the 1980s: you get arnold as ben richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to "run" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; richard dawson as damon killian, treating his role as if he were the host of family feud with the contestants using real guns; jesse ventura as "captain freedom" and co-wrestler professor tanaka as "subzero," both "stalkers" who kill the "running men." even mick fleetwood (mic) and dweezil zappa (stevie) show up, while the "dancers of the future" are none other than the laker girls. this movie screams "80s." the plot is a good excuse for the action: ben richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the running man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as "contestants." maria conchita alonzo as amber mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge salma hayek in the 1990s.the production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. i remember thinking when i was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? if the running man were listed in tv guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. the government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down american public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for "national security" is downright chilling. ben richards is played brilliantly by arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of america is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.the movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with back to the future iii, the "ravine" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. it is tragic that, as with wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. "serious" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their "common man" counterparts, such as this one.an absolute must-see.

amongst the standard one liner type action films, where acting and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. if the person in charge of casting were to have put "good" actors in this flick, it would have been worse(excepting richard dawson who actually did act well, if you can call playing yourself "acting"). i love this movie! the running man is in all likelihood god's gift to man(okay maybe just men). definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line: "it's all part of life's rich pattern brenda, and you better f*****g get used to it." ahh, more people have been called "brenda" for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine.

if you were brought up on a diet of gameshows you'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix. well, in the world of the running man, your needs will be sated. for in this game show, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate prize - their very lives.i loved this film. it was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis. it isn't one of schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it is a very good film. the underlying idea that television corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very believable, and is very well portrayed in this film. of course there are the usual arnie one-liners, my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the gameshow host asks "any last words?" arnie says: "yeah, i'll be back" but the host quips "only in a re-run" and presses the eject button. i give this film a 10 for sheer originality. i must have watched it 30 or more times. the only film apart from the die hard series that i watched this often!!in short, do not for a minute think that you own the t.v. - it owns you.....

the running man, along with total recall, is my favorite schwarzenegger movie. no, this isn't 2001, but it's not meant to be. and the acting and script here isn't even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator. but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. a state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are equipped with none) in order to satisfy the public's lust for sport and blood. the ultimate prize for a winning runner: freedom. or so the rules claim.for a movie with such over-the-top gory death scenes and cheesy one-liners, it really does have a lot to say. someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culture/government presented in this movie, so i won't go into it here. suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie, you will enjoy it very much (especially if you're a big sf fan with a lot of imagination). like i said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shoot-em-up flick. the premise is borrowed from a richard bachman (aka stephen king) short novel, but diverges fairly strongly from its source material, especially towards the end. (the book ends rather nihilistically; needless to say this movie doesn't.) i enjoyed both, but i like the movie better.my favorite line: "guess it's caused from steroids."

this is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring arnold schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including the television networks. one of their most popular tv shows is "the running man", where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. it's set up like a game show, where the audience votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky "contestants". audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. and the host is played by none other than family feud's richard dawson, who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. when ben richards (arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game.this movie is chock full of classic arnold one-liners, such as his famous "i'll be back" right before he enters the arena. and he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "how about a light?" i could go on and on, but i don't want to spoil the movie. it's funny stuff!whether it was intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "reality tv" craze. already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are televised for their "entertainment value". running man demonstrates what would happen if reality tv hit rock bottom, and it is a scary picture. one can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far.overall, this is a fun film & i highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!

arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives. but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play! the movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen, controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state. it's most popular game show is the running man, in which criminals are forced to survive against "stalkers" that live to kill them.the movie opens with ben richards (arnold) leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress. he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them, refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison, in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help. the government blames richards for the massacre earning him the name "butcher of bakersfield". eighteen months later richards along with two friends william laughlin (koto) and harold weiss (mcintyre) breakout of a detention zone they worked in. they make their way to the underground, led by mic (mick fleetwood). mic quickly identifies richards as the "butcher of bakersfield" and refuses to help him, but his friend's convince him otherwise. they want him to join the resistance, but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job. soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name amber mendez (alonso) has taken his apartment. knowing who he is she won't help him, but he convinces her, but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out.meantime, the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill. damon killian (dawson) the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture. richards refuses to play, killian threatens to use his friends instead of him, so he signs the contract. you'll love that part. but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure killian knows he'll be back. the runners begin to make there way through the zones and fight characters that are memorable, sub-zero, buzz saw and many others. eventually richards is joined by amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too. together they find the underground and make there way back to killian and give him a farewell send off.the running man is another one of arnold's great movies from the 80's. the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen king's book of the same name. some have said that the book is better. i'm sure it's not and i don't care anyway i loved the movie. as in all of arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even ventura gets a couple in. but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film. being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded. the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you. keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows, "hate boat" among others. also the cast was great besides arnold, koto, and alonzo don't forget professor toru tanaka, jim brown, ventura and sven-ole! with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now, but i'm sure the hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the "evil bush". the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one. some how the aclu managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things. blasphemy! overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him ,you can't miss this. its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day. the futuristic world and humor are great. overall 10 out 10 stars, definitely one of his best.

the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger films.but, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality tv. it is quite different to the stephen king book, true, but i doubt whether hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form.but, on with the review.ben richards (arnold schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. the economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like jumping for dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is the running man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian (played by the entertaining richard dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.some, however, try and speak up against the government. when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield, california, a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. when richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. he is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (yaphet kotto) and goes on the run.however, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez (marita conchita alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on the running man.and there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode. richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of los angeles (why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. amber also becomes curious about richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed. guess what happens to her, then? so, as amber, richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop. he's super arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accent.yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's arnie fun. there's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('he had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. it's a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.if you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed. but if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it. but the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.if you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv. it's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv. we've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. it seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.with that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...

i'm sitting here nov 2006 and i still can't help rave about this movie. arnold's best movies came in about a 4-5 year span. running man, predator, and total recall (1990). all 3 are amazing. the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall. they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017, but you can't help but snicker at the 80's style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv's. also the computer graphics of the "the running man" game show intro would not look like that in 2017. nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic. not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today's movie's. i really think that arnold's acting is much better than he's given credit for. now i would not have elected him governor but that's california for you. buzzsaw, dynamo, fireball, subzero are fantastic "stalkers" as well and i find the producers don't try to overkill the fight scenes. when the stalker is dead...he's dead. it doesn't go on for 20 minutes each. the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don't try and overplay it. i give this movie a 10/10 and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy a lot of movies these days. if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary.

this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time. when watching this movie , your filled with action, and when somethings not really happing , the humour is un matched. brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix , of a game show where criminals are the contestants, and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood.also arnold doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners.i don't want to spoil anything for you ,but i will tell you when arnold gives his "i'll be back line" he gets the best response of them all in this movie. hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did.

this is an awesome action film with great one liners from arnie!. it's stylishly made, with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied. the characters were awesome, and richard dawson, is very menacing as the main villain. yes it has tons of plot holes,however it's highly highly entertaining, with a great ending as well. it had a great story, too it, and arnie and maria conchita alonso had great chemistry together. the character development was also pretty good, with, some superb performances. the directing is great!. paul michael glaser, does a very good job here, with awesome use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, awesome camera angles, and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. there is a little bit of gore. we get a few bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, slit throat, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood, and an impaling. the acting is great!. arnold schwarzenegger is amazing as always, he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners, kicks that ass, and as always is a big physical presence!, and was tons of fun to watch! (arnie rules!). maria conchita alonso, does well here, she was really cute, and had good chemistry with arnie!. yaphet kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. marvin j. mcintyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!. richard dawson is awesome as the main villain, and was very very menacing, and he was fun to watch. jesse ventura,jim brown,erland van lidth,gus rethwisch,and professor toru tanaka, all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers. overall a must see! ****1/2 out of 5

mild spoilersin the near future, arnold stars as ben richards, a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'the running man', a deadly tv game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the 'stalkers'. of course, people are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold to prove the system wrong.i haven't read the stephen king book, but this is a great film regardless, one of arnold's best. he does what he does best in the action man role, delivering death with unforgettable one-liners. classics are probably the 'he was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a guy with barb wire, and 'he had to split!', referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically. dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter, and all the 'stalkers' are suitably camp. the action is violent, but its an action film. that's the point. the film is fast paced, and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. with starsky and hutch's paul michael glaser at the helm, and made in the wake of the success of the terminator, previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold, and very far fetched. but today, anyone who watches a lot of tv could see how the film is getting closer to reality. i wouldn't be surprised if i turn on the tv in the 'near future' and see a show not to far from this.on that depressing note, i must however recommend 'the running man' to anyone who likes the 80s, arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film. 9. 5 / 10

of all arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man. a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad. it may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. not when you think about it. currently, reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. if the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man? how long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the justice department? there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows.the biggest message of all is 'you are being lied to'. it's no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots. and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. it's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future. it's no secret that reality tv is not very realistic. it's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. usually it's far from the real truth.although rather different than stephen king's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical arnie formula. yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'i'll be back' (which he never really said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been (these two were considered before arnie believe it or not).the director is none other than dave starsky himself (paul michael glaser). it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. andrew davis (not a director i particularly like) was attached before glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.first of all, harold faltermeyer's score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release. gone is the horrid letterbox picture. in its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. the new dolby 5.1 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing. there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. definitely one of the best re-masters i've seen so far. two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'meet the stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.

i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago. then, the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional, if indeed they could ever transpire at all. not any longer. now, the politics, society, and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed.consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year the running man came out) that are present today:concern with, as richard dawson's character damon killian puts it, "traditional morality." checkentertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort on the part of contestants. checkcameras everywhere. checkrestricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports ("travel passes" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. checkan increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media. checkcomputer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage (such as the "digital matting" of ben richards' image onto the stunt double). checkjailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. checkflagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy; increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent. check, check, checkthen again, maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king novella. but just to be safe, i'm moving to switzerland.

return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original. it had black humor, good suspense, nice looking girls, and of course, a psycho killer. what are we missing? i think nothing. except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television. besides being one of the best sequels, it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. recommended for everyone.

the first was good and original. i was a not bad horror/comedy movie. so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch it.what really makes this movie work is judd nelson's character and the sometimes clever script. a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay. sometimes there's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy-look.great made-for-tv movie. it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson's stanley doing what he does best.i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel, just so you'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background.

actually... that "video camera" effect, is just that, it's an effect, a rather good one.. (u don't know much about directing a film do you?) this film is in fact better than the original, it's great fun to watch, made for tv, doesn't need to follow any rules. i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl, its disturbing. and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it, we as the viewers are on his side. i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it. watching this film you can understand how real movies are made, as this is sort of like a film within a film. judd is one of the scariest villains ever, and he's more realistic, he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors.

as a sequel,this is not a bad movie.i actually liked it better than the 1st one.i found it more entertaining.it seemed like it was shot documentary style.at first this bothered me,as i thought it just looked too low budget.but it grew on me,and it made the movie seem more authentic.this movie has more dry one liners than the original,which is a good thing,in my opinion.i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters.it almost becomes a parody of itself,which may be the point.this movie at least has some suspense,which the 1st one did not have,in my view.it has some of the same great music from the original,which is great.the acting again was pretty decent for the most part,though like i said,some of it seemed over the top.i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow,like the rest of the movie.overall,though,i thought this was a pretty sequel.my rating for "return to cabin by the lake" is 7/10*

when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie, i wanted to watch. it took me weeks to realize that i've seen the original of this and loved it. so i had even more reason to watch. well, i watched. it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies. i hate what happens to brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and i didn't like most of the characters, brian's one included. but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make stanley caldwell (judd nelson) shine once more. at the end, i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending. if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood, i'd suggest you watch this.

this movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake.i have been a fan of judd nelson's work for many years, and he blew me away. its a blend of horror, and drama ,and romance, not so much comedy. his evil, yet charming look captured me right then and there. that look in his eyes, i will never forget. there's something about him, i cant describe.

i loved this movie. it was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he kills men also. and the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly, when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberly's last moments before she is thrown to the water, and secondly, when stanley is visiting allison in his basement, right before they head down to the set, when she kisses him. those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. i gave the movie a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, i mean, there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong, like its being shot the way a film is usually shot, you wouldn't see the "live" camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. what went wrong??

sequels hardly ever live up to the original. this definitely proves true in this case. however, if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch. although the camera work is lacking, brian krause's character is annoying, and the plot is clique, it's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it. don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film. quite frankly it's a bit different. rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays, stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project, cabin by the lake. this movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see stanley back in action.i'm giving it a 6 out of 10.

i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while. sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die, stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant. it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died. my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. judd nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell. brilliant movie.

i don't know if i'm just weird, but i thoroughly enjoyed this film. return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake. in fact, i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. i also thought that the cast in this movie was great, judd nelson is always the best! i also enjoyed the plot as a whole. i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanley's screenplay cabin by the lake- it wasn't a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them. - if you're looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you. however, if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. i've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film. :)

a couple(janet and richard) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp. after camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house. soon, a pair of escaped convicts show up and, after much delaying of the inevitable, they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage.this last house on the left-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made. it's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers. moreover, i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone. i love caged terror. the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty. i found the film to be quite creepy.the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film, which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering. while i didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question, i do think that it will both most people. the acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue, at least in the early scenes. this film takes a little more patience than usual, and it's really not for everyone.in short, this was a good film. not the greatest horror film i've ever seen, but it is certainly a lot of fun. it's not exactly the easiest film to find. it's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough. it's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out.

when i watched this film the first time, it was a taped copy and the title was/is caged terror. i still own the tape, and i confess, i've watched it more than once from beginning to end! the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing! i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script. the film concerns a couple, (remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man!) who go on a week-end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be upstate ny. they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it! the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them, and he goes; "and that's beautiful man!" heavy man, really heavy! lol! anyway, along come a couple of vietnam vets, one of who plays the flute, i believe. (at any rate they are musical fellows!) the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly, they end up terrorizing them during the night. the guy ends up caged in a chicken coop, and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys. actually, by the end of the night, she seems to be pretty into it, and when morning comes, the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave. supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) anyway, i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! it never fails to amuse me anyway! if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy, i'd actually buy it again, it's classic camp! you gotta love this stuff!

at first,this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a trance the first time i saw it.it was like a bad dream.a cosmic bore.but i gave it a second chance,then another and another,etc...i finally got addicted to this film,due to it's dreamlike slow pace,wonderful natural sets,bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score,which is made of some 70's progressive rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor/singer/songwriter derek lamb(the troubadour).you should notice the song about hazel wood,silver trout and lady vanishing in the air...,heard in the middle and near the end of the film.there are some carnal scenes in the beginning ,wich allow us to appreciate the natural charms of elizabeth suzuki.if that movie had been made by some "repertoire" directors like bergman,lars von triers or jean-luc goddard,critics would have rolled on the floor,raving about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece.i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of fellini's cinematic sh#¤@t!definitely not for the pretentious.

polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in repulsion and rosemary's baby, in the tenant.the atmosphere is trademark polanski - dark, brooding, unnerving - but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate.sven nykvist, who was responsible for some of bergman's most beautiful films, doesn't quite do himself justice here. as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie, i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film.the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of trelkovsky. some of the supporting cast are great, notably melvyn douglas as the landlord and shelley winters as the concierge, but others are weak and miscast. it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed parisians have american accents.quite unexpectedly, there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film. anyone who has seen the fearless vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. however, there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows, which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey.all in all, the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience, if a little too languorous for its own good. there's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film, while being very good, does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have.alas, at the end of the day, an 'okay' polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies. definitely worth a watch, just don't expect to be blown away.

"the tenant" is roman polanski's greatest film imo. and i love "chinatown", but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy. it's also a great black comedy. some people i have shown this film to have been *very disturbed* by it afterwards so be forewarned it does affect some people that way. polanski does a great job acting the lead role in "the tenant" as well as directing it.

"le locataire"("the tenant")is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made.polanski stars as a trelkovsky,a timid file clerk living in paris,who answers an advertisement for an apartment,only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window.trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets stella(isabelle adjani).trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and,at first,is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment.his happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbours,who seem to be trying to provoke trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenant's suicide.this film is great.polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia.plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where trelkovsky discovers the previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall,or the fever dream where he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics.the photography by sven nykvist is truly beautiful."the tenant" is a neglected gem.it may be difficult to track down,but it is more than worth the effort.

i can understand how fans of filmmaker roman polanski could love this movie- and i could understand how some could totally hate it (ebert was one of the few who couldn't understand why people weren't running out of the theater). after a first viewing, i'm not sure i could fall into either category, however as someone who can't get enough of kafka and bizarre dark comedies of paranoia the tenant is effective enough for its running time. or maybe not- this is one of those cases where it might have been more of a masterwork if it were a half-hour twilight zone episode, with serling delivering the coda as terkovsky (or whomever it might be(?)) writhes in his bed in bandages. it's very similar in the treatment of the doomed protagonist as repulsion was, however it could be argued that there was more ambiguity, more of a sense of the surreal coming out through a sustained disintegration of character and location (and, quite frankly, a better lead performance) than the tenant.as it stands, the tenant does have an intriguing premise, the kind that one doesn't tire telling about to other people: polanski is a polish émigré to paris who takes an apartment that was most recently acquired by simone choule, who jumped to her near death out of the window and died soon after. but the other tenants are conservative to the max in terms of noise; after a saturday night at terkovsky's with a few friends, there are complaints of too much noise. it won't happen again, polanski's good-natured but slightly nervous tenant says, but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair. soon complaints get registered against another tenant, but from him? can he register complaints? this is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and the surrounding people. as the downward spiral goes on, polanski ratchets up tension (and, dare i say, black-comedic laughs) by showing terkovsky in the midst of a horrible dream- one of polanski's strongest scenes from the period- and in finding teeth in the wall, not to mention the bathroom across the way (which, i might add, is always a cinematic lynch-pin of horror and surreal madness).but somehow, the film never really feels all that significant aside from its excessive design as a would-be mind-f*** machine, with terkovsky's tenants only seeming to not be what they seem for a little while: there's not as much suspense when finding out that they really aren't out to get him, which makes the paranoia more self-fulfilling. at least once or twice i thought to myself as well 'why did polanski take the title role for himself?' it's not that he's at all a bad actor, and he has appeared in several films and plays that aren't of his own direction. but aside from being great at looking awkward and tense, like in the church, or in his moments of sort of flipping out when thinking that they really are out to get him to kill himself, his transformation is less creepy than tongue-in-cheek, a test of himself to see if he can pull it off, which he doesn't entirely do. despite polanski working at it well to look like the meek and frazzled terkovsky, i could see at least a few other actors who could pull it off with more subtlety and affecting personality. by the time one sees him in drag, it goes between cringe-worthy and true camp, particularly when he goes for the double-climax at the end (which, of course, is of little surprise).and yet there is pleasure for the film-buff and polanski fan to see the supporting cast try and dig into the much more ambiguous characters (winters and douglas do this the best, even as they have to strain through limited characters), and the unexpected moments like polanski and adjani getting hot and heavy during a bruce lee movie, or when he gets really drunk, or in one almost random scene where he slaps a kid near a fountain, are rather brilliant in and of themselves. it's a very good film, and one that could maybe stick my attention up when on too many coffees after midnight. but an essential film? not exactly.

this was my second time watching the film (via the french-language version as opposed to the first, which was dubbed in italian) and i feel that it improves on subsequent viewings.a compelling if slowly built-up character study that's beautifully shot and with the parisian settings being equally impressive. in the long run, it's not top-grade polanski and i would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but it's still a confident mix of subtle chills and, surprisingly, often broad comedy. it also features a fine cast, all of whom are in good form, but especially isabelle adjani, melvyn douglas and jo van fleet.even so, i'm a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for trelkovsky to 'change' into the previous tenant; apart from the owner of the café opposite the apartment building, where he is given whatever simone used to have without asking him if he wished any different, there is little to indicate (as far as i could discern, anyway) that this is what everybody wanted of him! okay, so he found simone's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her (even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously)? following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom, the last section of the film (where adjani all but disappears) is almost anti-climactic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the opera, a concept which had already been used 46 years earlier by jean cocteau in the blood of a poet (1930)!the ending, then, is at once predictable and unresolved: just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window?!; i remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well, and i'm sorry to say it's no clearer now! mind you, the film's first two-thirds are pretty solid but i wish that polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout.

this is my kind of film. i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. but it is also a dark comedy. while i see it mostly as a horror/thriller, there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy.but either way, it is a fascinating descent into madness. the ending caught me off guard, but what an ending! it leaves the viewer a lot to think about.powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor, and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watching.personally, i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within. but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do.

one thing i'm sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy. the other films in polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy too, but they are all different in what makes them creepy, but they all roughly deal with the same thing, they all deal with the mind. definitely the staring people are very creepy, each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still. again, if you have seen the other two films mentioned, i'm sure you'll find this quite creepy, because you begin to expect typical polanski traits that you think you have caught onto, he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things, personally every time trelkovsky would slowly turn around i would be bracing myself for a jump, maybe that's just me, but it felt intended to do that, though it was quite subtle, there is no build up of the music in those moments.the acting in this was pretty good, mostly that from polanski of course, the other characters in the film don't have all that much time to outshine the lead. polanski really proves himself as an all-round great filmmaker, he not only can direct and write great films, but he can actually act too. i don't think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the trelkovsky character, polanski settled right on in perfectly. i like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast, to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent, which i respect greatly.one thing i didn't like about this film is how it was done in english. for those who don't know, this is a french film, american financed, and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in english. there are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing, and i don't know why it is, but 3/4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub. there is a women in the film who when she speaks it's obvious it's a dub, but they got the most annoying person to do the voice-over, it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak, she had the loudest high pitch voice i've heard in a while, it almost seemed fake, but i don't see what the point was, she was a rather small character. i honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed, parts of it in french and parts of it in english, because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near (two completely different films, i know) the high standard of another film that did a similar thing, which was, the good, the bad and the ugly. i realise it's not a big problem, just when you do realise it, it gets annoying, but i'm sure you won't sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying, regardless if you know french.whats so great about polanski is that he will let you think you know him, that you know his style, which in some aspects you do, but really, you can't see whats behind that corner. this film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned, which i think really strengthens this one in particular. i personally feel this is the best of the three, i'm unsure which comes next, but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness. the ending is fantastic, it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere. i choose not to think to much on it, just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that.i've rambled on, and i haven't really given any insight on what makes this film so great, i don't think, so i'll quickly do it here. if you liked repulsion and/or rosemary's baby, i guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least. for those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then i recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent, particularly the end, as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind, paranoia even, though that is better fitted under repulsion.

roman polanski plays trelkovsky who rents an apartment in france.the previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt.he goes to see her there where he also meets stella (isabelle adjani), the friend of simone.he and stella become pretty close.later simone dies.trelkovsky begins to think the landlord and the neighbors are trying to change him into simone so that eventually he would also jump out of the window.le locataire (the tenant) from 1976 is the last film of polanski's apartment trilogy.the previous ones were repulsion and rosemary's baby.roman polanski does not do good job only as the director but his acting is also superb.isabelle adjani with her big glasses is wonderful.the landlord, monsieur zy is played by the great melvyn douglas.jo van fleet plays madame dioz.the fantastic shelley winters is the concierge.the tenant is something very scary from time to time.it gives a lot of that psychological scare.this film is not the easiest one to understand or explain but that makes it all so fascinating.

here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made, but whose standing seems to be raising in time. 'the tenant' is quite an interesting work by polanski, one of the first of his european exile. it is set in paris, and as in so many other exile films the city, its streets, the seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role. it is just that polanski chooses his principal character not to be an american (as in 'frantic' for example) but a pole, as himself was when going west. there is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film, made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director's life, and the fact that he decided to play the lead role (and does it masterfully) may also be seen as some kind of exorcism.it's in a way a circular story. the hero named trelkovsky rents an apartment in old parisian building, inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors. the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat, and trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend stella (a spectacled isabelle adjani in her first role after truffaut's 'l'histoire d'adele h.'). soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are, it's a conspiracy to make him crazy, or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl. he fights, tries to run, enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her. the circle is closed.it's not the most believable story we may have seen or heard, but the strength of the film does not reside in the story but in the details of the psychology, in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero, in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion. to a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters, but how it happens, reminding the classical 'knife in the water' made more than a decade before, at the end of the polish period of polanski. there are many details that are never explained, but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes. the feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer. unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the english spoken dialogs (the film was made in english) almost neutralize the overall atmosphere. however, waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patience.it's not the best film that polanski made, yet has many good parts, it shows the hand and the style of the director, and was a significant step in the building of his career.

if you liked roman polanski's "repulsion", you should probably check out "the tenant" since it's a similar concept, just with polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko. this is actually one of my favorites of his movies - second, after "rosemary's baby", of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim. the other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest 'titter' becomes a big deal and polanski, who stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on. it gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it's only a matter of time before he decides tor re-enact her fatal leap out the window... the film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you have ever seen a roman polanski movie, you should know it's going to end with a bang and this flick doesn't disappoint. it's also best if you don't question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness, because it's pretty trippy surreal at times. polanski is very good as the timid, deranged resident who, somehow, attracts the ever illustrious isabelle adjani. we also get to see him running around in drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time! damn, he makes for one ugly chick! so, polanski fans - who can actually look past his thirty year-old pedophile charges - should enjoy "the tenant" as an entertaining psychological head-trip...

this oddity from roman polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it. polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. he becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. the movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of "rosemary's baby" and "repulsion," two other better polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.but as for the preoccupation....unless i'm reading too much into the film, i have to believe that this was polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from america. not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.grade: b+

this is a very difficult movie, and it's almost impossible to get a handle on what's going on. at first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy (trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and rather crassly invites himself into one when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. then the twists and turns start. are the neighbors trying to kill him? and why are the dead tenant's clothes turning up in the apartment? one wonders, finally, if trelkovksy _is_ the prior tenant. spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler one of the tricks polanski pulls on us is to lie to us. we assume when we see things from the point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality. we assume when the camera is showing us things from its omniscient point of view that we see actuality - but polanski has the camera lie to us.

once i watched the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. it uses many of the tropes of the genre: the sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mysteries, hallucinations. the life of the hero, trelkovsky, seemed surrounded by evil, secret forces trying to drive him mad.last time i watched it i challenged this initial interpretation. if this movie is a horror movie, it's only horror in the sense that a kafka novel is horror. in fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence.polanski made in his career three movies dealing with madness: repulsion, which i don't particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me; rosemary's baby, in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces; and the tenant, which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema.trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman killed herself. he becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her: he wears her clothes, puts on makeup, talks like her. but is he being possessed by a spirit, or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him? it's this hesitation between what is real and imaginary, and which polanski never resolves, that makes this such a fascinating movie. many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes, and it's up to the viewer to decide what to believe in.although this is not my favorite polanski movie, it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms. and technically speaking, it's a marvel too. suffice to say he collaborates with film composer philippe sarde and legendary director of photography sven nykvist (bergman's dp) in the making of this movie. a slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy, but it's an experience nevertheless.

sure, he became rapidly uneven after this film, but from "knife in the water" up till "the tenant", roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique. despite many running themes (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films are really alike. the story of this is somewhat similar to his own "repulsion" from ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. "the tenant" manages to balance darker than dark absurdity (i'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor, even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny) with some truly suspenseful paranoia. polanski was always a master at building unease, and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy. the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus.in addition to polanski's exquisite as usual direction, the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions. polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director, but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast. the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange. the rest of the cast offers strong performances also, especially isabelle adjani's sympathetic turn, and melyvn douglas and shelley winters' appropriately annoying ones. "the tenant" is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both "repulsion" and "rosemary's baby", but its just as brilliant as either of those classics. (9/10)

when this film opened back in 1976, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure. i vividly remember ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at cannes.apparently these people didn't understand the movie, which is not that hard to comprehend since it's very esoteric, dark, and layered in ways that still astound me. reading through many of the reviews here i find (even after about 7-8 viewings over the years) many elements of the film i had previously glossed over. but even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story, it's still a cracking suspenser...even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes polanski's title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it's two hour running time.examining the source material --- an excellent novella by underrated novelist roland topor --- uncovers more intriguing layers. polanski's trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order. though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul, one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life, letting it direct him. he seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes. he finds himself gently pushed this way and that, but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless. this vague sort of wishy-washy-ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie, but there are hints of it early in the film too.making a play for the apartment of a woman, one mademouiselle choule, who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt, appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted (even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain). he soon finds, however, that he is paying for his "good thing" in more ways than he cares, as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic, control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life, such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the door.instead of taking a stand though, trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation, and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution. he becomes obsessed with choule, imagining himself to be like her, dressing like her, etc. as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity.if anyone has ever doubted polanski's fearlessness as an artist, they'd be well-advised to see this film. his trademark black humor is prominently (and sometimes embarrassingly) on display here and --- god bless him --- he makes himself the butt of it. it's a tour de force performance in one of the richest, riskiest, most gothic horror movies ever made. that more people haven't seen it is a true crime.

roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion. i can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire, yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people, myself included.polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters (deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire), starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise. the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no tangible supernatural element here. while horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) polanski sadistically tortures us and, if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats.suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations (alternatively fooling and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. in my book rosemary's baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat, while we are forced to identify with a sole character. what's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we, the viewers, are compelled to judge him, reject him while we have been masterfully lured ("paint 'n lure") into being him.

i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously. i believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. i'm giving all the credit to polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager. luckily for me, my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this (so far) but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the (fake) reality he is trying to convey. simply put, the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. this film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting. as some performances were done in english (the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others) and others in french (with most other characters) and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french, i heartily recommend, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from french to english and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd. this film is part of polanski's so-called "apartment building trilogy" which also comprises "repulsion" and "rosemary's baby". unfortunately, "repulsion" still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1. needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset.

in paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat trelkovsky (roman polanski) rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant, the egyptologist simone choule (dominique poulange), committed suicide. the unfriendly concierge (shelley winters) and the tough landlord mr. zy (melvyn douglas) establish stringent rules of behavior and trekovsky feels ridden by his neighbors. meanwhile he visits simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend stella (isabelle adjani). after the death of simone, trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide. the weird "le locataire" is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion. the story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely trelkovsky are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment, and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable. the performances are awesome and isabelle adjani is extremely beautiful. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "o inquilino" ("the tenant")

i'm a pretty old dude, old enough to remember the taste of oreos and coke as they were 50-55 years ago, when every taste for a kid was fresh. i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker, so that i could taste those things today. this magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how i've drifted, physically and otherwise, a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations. over the half century, they would have had to adjust quite a bit, because you see i would have known that i set them aside. eating one now would be a celebration of self and past, and story, and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward.i didn't have enough sense to do that with original coke. and i couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then. but i did something almost as good. in the seventies, i really tuned into roman polanski. he was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know, movies smuggled out of the soviet block. movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward. movies that make you want to live with polish women, one, and then deciding that they would be the last to get it.here's what i did. i took what i knew would be my favorite polanski movie and set it aside. i did not watch it. i deferred until i thought i would be big enough to deserve it. over the years, i would test myself, my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it. there probably are few poles who have worked at this, practicing to deserve chopin. working to deserve womanness when i see it. trying to get the inners from the edges.recently, i achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out. i already knew that i was already past the time when this would work optimally, because i had already seen and understood "9th gate."if you do not know this, it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant (about whom the story is named) jumped out the window, to die later after this man (played by polanski) visits. what happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman. we are fooled into believing that he is merely mad. but the way we follow him, he is not. he merely has flashes that the world is normal, and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality.the story hardly matters. what matters is how polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh. the two never meet. there is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years. its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wig.i know of no one else that could do this, this sketch that remains a sketch, this horror that remains natural.to understand the genius of this, you have to know one of the greatest films ever made; "rear window." the genius of that film is the post-noir notion that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates the story. what roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out. in rear window, the idea was that the on-screen viewer (jimmy stewart) was the anchor and everything else was fiction, woven as we watched. here, the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker. we know this. we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. we know it is true that bodies shift identity, that times shift, that causality is plastic. we know that the narrator will kill us. we know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror, on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine. ted's evaluation -- 4 of 3: every cineliterate person should experience this.

it took a long time until i could find the title in a special videothek in berlin, and i was lucky to find an english version with hollandish undertitles. i think it´s one of the best horrormovies ever. it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy. i must admit, i wasn´t able to laugh about, when i saw it the first time (and it was the same with the second time!) on the one hand trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour, but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that. but the most weired thing is of course his transformation in simone choule and the fact, that he doesn´t know, who he really is. his halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie. of course it´s all in his mind, but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in - i think that´s an interesting question. his shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and it´s horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other. the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his/her window. but this terrible cry - does that mean, that all will repeat again and again and again... that his soul is in a cage or something? and these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff ? the fact, that he/she looks like a mummy in the hospital - that´s not an incident, but a clue in my point of view.

a kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. extremely well done and polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. personally i could have done without the cross dressing element but i accept the nod to psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. i can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' frenchman and jewish to boot. still, there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking isabelle adjani and good old shelly winters is as reliable as ever.

what can be said, really... "the tenant" is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. it's an intricately-plotted film--every detail seems included for a reason--even though the plot seldom makes sense, and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky (polanski)--a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide--to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty. after an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers, trelkovsky comes under increased, seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu*k on par with the later efforts of david lynch. "the tenant," however, is more brooding and sinister, laced with unexpected comic relief, fine performances, and a truly haunting score. it's a movie that's better experienced than described, so hop to it.

after his classic film noir homage chinatown roman polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which, like repulsion and rosemary's baby, deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment living.claustrophobic environments are the ones which polanski is best at creating, and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created. the emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever, and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed. but the tenant is not just confined spatially, but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist. trelkovsky, played by polanski himself is not only in every scene, he is in virtually every shot. when he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes trelkovsky's point of view. and of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirror.i can't think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character. some psychological thrillers, like m or peeping tom, manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist. others, like psycho, attempt in-depth scientific analysis of his mental condition. the tenant fits into neither of these categories  it simply immerses us completely inside trelkovsky's experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head. we feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational.polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film. often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on, but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences. why? precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia. a much later polanski horror, the ninth gate is a bit of a mess plot-wise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dread.this is a rare chance to see polanski himself in a major role. his talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it, and he is absolutely perfect as the meek trelkovsky. another standout performance is that of the all-too-often overlooked shelley winters as the concierge. in actual fact it is rather a stellar cast, although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange, gothic european movie. also sadly many of the french actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the english language version.the tenant is more polished and less pretentious than repulsion, but it lacks the suspense and the character that make rosemary's baby so engrossing and entertaining. the tenant is good, with no major flaws, and polanski was really on top form as a director, but it's not among his most gripping works.

this is one creepy movie. creepier than anything david lynch, and that shows what a great director polanski is since this is not his usual type of work, and it is brilliant.it all starts of with trelkovski moves into a tenement block in paris. he soon learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it. he also believes that they are trying to do the same to him. what results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia.the whole production has classical horror written all over it: from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor trelkovski's terror building up.are they all out to kill him? or maybe just drive him mad? is there a difference? find out for yourself. 10/10

i once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight - so, needless to say, i can easily relate to polanski's "the tenant." but i also enjoy the film for other reasons. i'm not sure that it works, on the whole - the polanski character's descent into paranoia and madness, which takes up the final half hour or so, seems rather jarring and bizarre. ebert, for one, was totally unconvinced, and he slapped the movie with a vicious one-star review. but i think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even though i don't quite understand the whole film - what does egyptology have to do with it, for example? - i still have an overall positive impression of it.i love the obnoxious friend portrayed by bernard fresson, for example. god, how many times have i settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all! i love the movie theater scene - the funniest "making out" moment in the history of film, i'd say. and boy, do i love isabelle adjani - she's so foxy in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. and she gives a great performance, as always.polanski is a good actor, too; i don't agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about his performance here. his character is supposed to be low-key and thoughtful, so his low-key performance fits. i, for one, found him perfectly sympathetic - though he did lose me a bit when he started dressed in drag for no clearly discernible reason.yes, the movie's obscure. and slow. but it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living - something i've done entirely too much of - so i dig it. it's funny how all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant! definitely worth picking up for pocket change on dvd.

roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind classics such as "rosemary's baby" and "chinatown". probably what makes polanski's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces, he is also fond of making low-key movies that are of a more personal nature. "le locataire", or "the tenant", is one of those movies; a horror/suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done.polanski himself plays telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in france. when he finally finds one, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, simone choule, attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window. after simone dies of the injuries, trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her, to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building.while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other "apartment-themed" films ("repulsion & "rosemary's baby"); this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky's head, the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind, and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant.trelkovsky's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski. while at first his performance seems odd and wooden, slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way; as a simpleton with almost no life, who traps himself in this maddening sub-world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people. the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film.also, the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation, and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky. the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive.if a flaw is to be found in the film, is that it is definitely a bit slow at first. this may sound like a turn-off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm. also, the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has. however, more than a flaw, it is a joy to face a thought-provoking plot like this one.while "the tenant" may not be for everyone, those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience. "le locataire" is really one of roman polanksi's masterpieces. 10/10

meek, tiny, almost insignificant. polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it. in front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces i had the pleasure to see and see and see again. it never let's me down. people, even people who know me pretty well, thought/think there was/is something wrong with me, based on my attraction, or i should say, devotion for "le locataire" they may be right, i don't know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within polanski's darkness and i haven't even mentioned the humor. the mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes over him and, naturally, us, me. that building populated by great old academy award winners: melvyn douglas, shelley winters, jo van fleet, lila kedrova. for anyone who loves movies, this is compulsory viewing. one, two, three, many, many viewings.

farrah fawcett gives an award nominated performance as an attempted rape victim who turns the tables on her attacker. this movie not only makes you examine your own morals, it proves that fawcett can excel as a serious actress both as a victim and victor.

farrah fawcett gives the best performance by an actress on film in this gritty real life attempted rape thriller where she turns the tables & gives james russo a taste of his own medicine. a must see for any movie fan.

i've never been a fan of farrah fawcett...until now. she was truly amazing in this movie. the emotion she must have gone through shooting re-take after re-take doesn't bare thinking about. this was a very hard movie to watch, the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity. i actually felt that the whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i didn't find the conclusion at all plausible. the director seemed very keen in using height in his shots and loved using mirror reflections, i believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this piece. i'm sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theatre, this movie for me, although it had merit, just fell short.

attractive marjorie(farrah fawcett)lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker. she is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address. as expected, joe(james russo), the attacker forces his way into marjorie's home and subjects her to humiliating terror. bruised and bloody, marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker, knocking the living daylights out of the jerk and renders him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat. hog tied and battered himself, joe tries to explain himself to marjorie's roommates(diana scarwid and alfrie woodard) when they get home. there is almost a hint of mercy, but it is not coming from marjorie. should she continue to render her own punishment? violence, sexual abuse and rough language makes for an r rating. fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career. kudos to director robert m. young.

marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two female roommates, pat and terry.one night she gets in her car and is attacked by masked man with a knife.his plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape.the man has her purse.the police can't help her, since the actual rape didn't happen.then one day, when marjorie's roommates are at work, her assailant comes there.his name is joe.a long battle begins against this man.but then she manages to spray his eyes and mouth with insect repellent, stuff that will kill him if he won't get help soon.she ties him up and makes joe the subject of the same kind of physical and mental assaults he used on her earlier.the extremities (1986) is directed by robert m. young.it's based on the controversial off-broadway play from 1982 by william mastrosimone.farrah fawcett, who sadly lost her battle with cancer last year, is terrific as marjorie.james russo, who played the attacker also in the play, is convincing as joe.alfre woodard and diana scarwid are great as pat and terry.james avery is seen as security guard.she got a golden globe nomination.this is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you.it asks a question is revenge justified.this is not a perfect movie, but i recommend it.

this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do! the acting was the best, farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous. james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful. there aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one. the cast was great alfie looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re-lived her horror as she went through it. farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him, yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do. the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene.

having looked at some of the other comments here, i have a main complaint with this presentation. the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful "victim," and the handsome, obviously extremely "off-center," blue-collar protagonist (if just short of "totally-deranged") - take turns beating the hell out of each other, sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario.this is all right, and this is, of course, mainly a "turning-the-tables" story. however, my referenced complaint is that i believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe, and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes, these distract from the poignancy level of the drama.her roommates i'm certain give performances as written and directed - however, their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, don't ring true -- based upon farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions, and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred.but this is a film and story, compelling as much in spite of, as because of, the director's work.

i loved this excellent movie. farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart. she plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger. after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her own.then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again. not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her fireplace.i think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land. they are too easy on these criminals. it's time for more harsh punishments.

marjorie (a splendid and riveting performance by farrah fawcett) narrowly avoids being assaulted in her car by vicious serial rapist joe (superbly played with frightening conviction and intensity by james russo). however, joe steals her wallet and finds out where marjorie lives. he pays her a visit one fateful day. after subjecting marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse, marjorie manages to turn the tables on joe and locks him in the fireplace. what is marjorie going to do with joe? director robert m. young and screenwriter william mastrosimone concoct a harsh, gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails the stark brutality and painful debasement of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity. joe perceives women strictly as objects while marjorie only sees joe as an "animal." however, this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make joe out to be simply a vile one-dimensional creep; instead he's a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid (joe's climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant). fawcett and russo are both outstanding in the leads; they receive fine support from diana scarwid as the passive terry, alfre woodard as the sensible patricia, and sandy martin as sympathetic policewoman officer sudow. both curtis clark's agile cinematography and j.a.c. redford's shivery, skin-crawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension. a real powerhouse.

kudos to fawcett to taking on roles that, at the time were considered controversial. to my recollection, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980's, and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time.fawcett is simply a woman who is followed, then stalked by actor james russo. he is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but at times a bit transparent.diana scarwid has a bit role, as does alfre woodard as the house mate. woodard worries about the legal consequences when fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit. the scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at russo is classic, and as the rapist he deserves it. she then keeps him in bondage, and the consequences must be faced.a very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated, physically, and mentally. highly recommended. 8/10.

riveting drama, scripted by william mastrosimone based on his stage play, in which farrah fawcett plays marjorie, attacked in her car by rapist joe (james russo). she manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do. she realizes, however, that joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives. when her housemates pat (alfre woodard) and terry (diana scarwid) are off at work, joe pays her a visit to finish what he started. after joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways, she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him. knowing full well she's in another "his word against yours" situation and that no rape technically took place, she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to pat and terry what his intentions were.the movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents. as it goes on, marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasn't become as unhinged as her nemesis. fawcett does a creditable enough job, while russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation. with only two characters on screen for much of the running time, the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage. director robert m. young doesn't shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation; the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times. and by the time marjorie has the upper hand, things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood, and one hopes that pat can make her see reason."extremities", i felt, was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity. woodard and scarwid are both fine in support (scarwid has a great moment where terry reveals herself to be a rape victim), and the pace is consistent. granted, the dialog isn't always very sharp, but the material is compelling every step of the way.8/10

farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would-be rapist. well done to farrah for being a golden globe 'best actress' nominee.when her rapist joe (terrifically played by james russo) comes into her home, which she shares with her two roommates (who are conveniently out!), marjorie has to play along with joe's frightening demands. it does make for some disturbing and shocking images!when her roommates come home, they are astounded (to say the least) by marjorie's actions, and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, makes the film even more nail-biting.i do find diana scarwid quite irritating, but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all, it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed.overall, extremities is a brilliantly thought-out and well-acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now! well done to everybody involved.

extremities is the disturbing, yet riveting screen version of a play by william mastriosimone (who adapted his own play for the screen) about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a would-be rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives. after her roommates leave for work the next day, the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her. the story takes a surprising twist when, at one point, the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him; but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested, he will just get off, she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him. far-fetched? maybe. disturbing? definitely, but there's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film, especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker, that you can't help but feel completely a part of what's going on. i did not see the play on broadway, but i would imagine a piece like this works better onstage, but that doesn't make this film any less riveting an experience. farrah fawcett, one of the last actresses to do the role on broadway, was awarded the role of marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim. many critics found fawcett's performance to be one-note, but for me, marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me. james russo, in the performance of his career, is slimy and menacing as the would-be rapist who finds marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed. alfre woodard and diana scarwid co-star as marjorie's roommates, who come home after marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival. and it's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didn't see what we saw marjorie go through and therefore, think she should call the police and let them handle the guy. not for the faint of heart, but if you can stand it, a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you.

i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon.com based on my other interests. they hit the nail on the head with this one. i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it. ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time. lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together, even though they are somewhat rivals. almost representing good (caleb) and evil (sherriff lucas buck). i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that i don't believe were granted by anything holy. he can make phones ring, writing appear, or even cause a person's emotions to change. none the less, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all. all in all, this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of, (i.e. point pleasant, threshold, nowhere man, and seaquest dsv just to name a few) were cancelled way before their time. the steven king's the dead zone ( sunday's usa network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it. there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore. this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv. so, in the meantime, i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch "quality" shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is).

recently when i was shopping, i saw the box-set of americian gothic, and i thought 'i remember that!' i used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was on ch 4 in 1996 at 1.30am (i was 14). i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck (with a b!!) no one ever was anyway. what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box-set as when on tv. episodes in funny order, i kept thinking when does dr matt leave??? - they made it so confusing. however this is not the writers, producers or directors fault (its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same - just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they don't like originality in studios!!!!!)to finish - if you've not seen this and you call yourself a sci-fi fantasy, horror, supernatural drama..fan = you must. they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the box-set.

i don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! it was a great shame when it was canceled, and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. the good news is that it is out on dvd!!!! i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it. gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character, and all actors were very good. it is a shame that the network did not continue it. shaun cassidy, this is a masterpiece. anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must do so. you will not be disappointed. my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan. she finds it "very twisted" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.this show rocks!!!!

i recently purchased the complete american gothic series on dvd and it lived up to my memories of it. i was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never televised. i loved "ring of fire" in particular of the stories i hadn't seen the first time around.gary cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" lucas buck. lucas black as caleb is also a superb player. i thought brenda bakke as selena coombs was also superb in her portrayal. in fact, the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other.it's a shame the series was screwed by the network (in collusion with a burgeoning group of censors) because it was truly designed for adult viewing. a mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance and horror genres, it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level.i had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life. long live gary cole (sheriff lucas buck), the most luscious "fallen angel" ever.

i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd (yay!) it's striking me as fresh, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired.the central performances are gripping, the scripts are layered.i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035.i've been asked to write some more line (it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever! pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way.)well, unlike imdb's submissions editors, american gothic understands that simplicity is everything.in 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation.when the show first aired, i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off. personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years. reckon it don't get more controversial than that!

"someones at the door". ohhh, how i miss this show so bad.. but we are lucky to now have "invasion". thank you, shawn cassidy. american gothic, had it all.if i had to pick one thing that i liked best about the show, it has to be its "not predictable plot-lines". favorite actor was lucas black.. i adore that southern accent. i bought the dvd asap, and my kids are fans too. there is some hot n steamy scenes. some devilish ones too. so, if kiddos will be watching you may want to edit(fastforward/skip). it has humour, on a joss wheedon level, which so many shows lack. adult wit and adult situation, that are handled with finese. the dvd has some extras, but i wish it has many more. if you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show, come watch "american gothic"!

it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the show were great as well, and complimented one another well. i was sorry to see it cut off.. i would have loved to see where it could have went.you found yourself leaning toward lucas buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. lucas was frightening and alluring. and i would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. i will however buy the show just to enjoy, it was great to something different on tv. and paige turrco who was caleb's cousin, she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to lucas. its a shame it isn't around still.. or was never finished, i would have loved to see what would have happened.

i love the series! many of the stereotypes portraying southerrners as hicks are very apparent, but such people do exist all too frequently. the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well, but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well. some things never change, and we see the "good old boys" every day! there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen, and the storybook "po' white trash" are all too familiar. aside from the supernatural elements, everything else could very well happen in the modern south! i somehow think trinity, sc must have been in barnwell county!

this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk. the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it. all you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that i can see) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination. i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that's just so unbelievable. what a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that.

i watched the show 10 years ago and loved it!!! am now in possession of the dvd and was watching the series, and waiting for scenes i knew were in the show (when lucas confronts gail in his house)and realized it was missing - all of a sudden i was watching the seduction without the lead up. then i went on line to check out all the bios of the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out of order. thank you!!!!! but there seems to be some conflict. some comments state "strangler number 19 then triangle 20, when another had them around the other way. and also potato boy 5, and dead to the world 6, were reversed as well. can someone clarify?????

i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of david lynch's twin peaks - a show which i adore. the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot, its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season. my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by the show - probably not through its own fault, as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season, it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got. the acting is excellent, and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil) in it i have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time. there is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic, but this is rectified as the season progressed. well worth a watch, definitely something out of the ordinary!

i could never remember the name of this show. i use to watch it when i was 8. i remember staying up late when i wasn't suppose to just so i could watch this show. it was the best show to me. from what i remember of it, it is still great. this showed starred lucas black making him the first boy i ever had a crush on. i am from the country, therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me, but for him i would definitely make an exception. which after seeing crazy in alabama, friday night lights, and tokyo drift you should see why. he is a great actor and has been since he was a kid. i miss this show and wish it would come back out. if anyone ever sees where they are selling the season please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com

i remember watching american gothic when it first aired, it came into my mind recently, all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight caller, which is gary cole, i don't watch much tv, but i watched american gothic, i purchased the complete series on dvd this week,& it's still as good as ever, this is one of the best tv series ever, the reason i don't watch much tv is because it's just rubbish that's on, except for derren brown, it's all reality tv or soaps, such as grease, big brother etc, i'm fed up with it, i got the complete series of american gothic for £16.97 form the asda website, that's the cheapest i can find it.

this was one of the best shows ever made for tv. full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. compulsive viewing. i was lucky i saw this in the uk. they might have got the episode order wrong, i can't remember, but it at least was on at a regular time every week. my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in, and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally.after the pilot, we knew this was something special. we missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.great casting, superb acting. gary cole was absolutely brilliant, better even than his role as custer. lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid, and paige turco was at her best too since party of five. and nick searcy of course, as the sheriff's long suffering sidekick.yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which i presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. that made the ending weak, and you could tell they'd killed it. made us go what? why did they do that with one of the best shows ever? shoot the exec.

ag was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv. sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies. we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas. we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising. this show lived up to the "gothic" moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less mastered. the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. this show puts shame to the current glut of "reality" shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.the call for a dvd box set is well based. this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. a public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. bring on the dvd box set!!

i may have seen an episode or 2 when the show originally aired but when i watched 1 episode on netflix i was also hooked. i watched the whole series in like 2 days. :) i really liked gary cole's character. first he's thoroughly reprehensible then you start liking the character ("these things have a thousand uses")! his folksy andy griffith meets charles manson meets satan is great. charming, charismatic, smarmy, and uh kind of dangerous and by "kind of" i mean "really". i wanna be like him when i grow up. lucas black is great too. the accents are great too. anyway, i thought this was one of the best tv shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.

i see a lot of folks on this site wishing ag would come out on dvd. well, i bought it on dvd. (from borders, no less!) while it is great to have this terrific show in a boxed dvd form, i am upset by the fact that they added very few in the way of "extra's" (a director commentary from shaun cassidy on the pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on tv. the missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on sci fi channel are in the box set, but are tacked on the final dvd. if you buy the dvd set, get the actual order they are to be viewed and you will be happier. (you will need to swap dvd's in and out of your player to see them in order, but you will be glad you did.)s

after realizing what is going on around us ... in the news .. in our homes .. the whole new world .. i remembered this show and how obsessed i was watching it every week (in my town) ..i started looking for this series .. 3 days ago .. didn;t have luck till this moment .. and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs ..people, i believe they stopped the show because it's talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world ... it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying ..the people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world now .. i remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the one dollar and the pyramid with the one eye ...

14 years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made. the writing was 1st class and the production second to none. this show would never be made today and that this a shame. i hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do. ag came out the year i left high school at the time my fav tv show was the x files this gives you an idea of why i first got into this show. ag was a far better program with better writing but only got one reason? i know this is not the only program to only get one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunman (x files spin off) it had good writing and was funny but also only got one season. it does not seem right! we also have to remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows 'cool' so i think this may have also let to the show going down hill. watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.

i really like this show. i can readily see how it achieved cult status. it's original, and thought provoking. for some reason though, i have never felt the kind of resonance from it that i could have. it doesn't pack the kind of open door, winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise. each time i watch an episode, i find myself prodding, and pushing for it to answer some nameless, formless question.before continuing, let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion, and my opinion only. different strokes for different folks.i would have liked to have seen more scenes in "american gothic" that were shot at night. there's too much daylight in this show, and i think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense. we're not afraid of the daylight, after all. we're concerned about what's in the shadows. the devil isn't always in the details. what we're not seeing is often the most frightening.second--and this is the one that's probably going to lead to tar, and feathers: gary cole is a tremendously talented actor...a character actor. i've followed his career from the brady bunch films on, which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as lucas buck. he's almost too petroichan, too likable to be embodiment of evil, even by biblical standards. lucas buck is a narcotic. he's heroin. he's freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of drain-o. you keep going back, even though you know the end will be madness, and death. he should be like the ultimate loan shark. he's a maker of book, but also of unspeakable condemnation. sure. you've got the money, and before long you're also going to have broken fingers; a severed hand, a decapitated head, and eventually, a damned soul. turning to buck is an act of desperation, and whenever he's around, there should be some immediate, ambient finality--with interest compounded daily--in the air.it's all largess, all strings attached, and by the time you realize that, you'll also know that it's too late.which leads me to three: they showed buck a little too often. he's in most of the scenes, in fact, which may have caused him to lose his edge. the sheriff would be like the next door mythology. he's the apocryphal acquaintance. many would know 'of' him, but only an unfortunate few would really know him. he'd be the stuff of flashbacks, and cryptic conversations, and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that nick searcy portrayed.four, the show could be very self-reverential--to a fault, some might say--and this is typified by the whistling of "meet me at the fishing hole" in the series pilot. i think we've already established that what cassidy, and raimi were shooting for was the anti-andy taylor. we probably didn't need the concept delivered to us via fed ex. i gathered that within the first five minutes so, for me, the piano on the head was unnecessary.these remarks are all about what, for me, would have made a good show great. i also understand that the producers had their own, unique style, and that there were many hands in the soup. in their everlasting quest for lcd programming, the network played a definite role in the demise of this series.the least these jerk-off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order.get real.either way, it's a grievous loss to both genre fans, and casual viewers alike.

they had me from the first show.welcome to trinity county. a sleepy little mayberry-like place with one slight difference. the sheriff is really satan. there's the spoiler. not like you wouldn't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway.oh, but that's not all. it turns out that satan has a son named caleb. some people are trying to keep him good, but it's an uphill battle. sheriff buck (satan) knows who caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. subtle. sneaky. he doesn't always come off as evil. most of the time he's a hero. everyone owes him a big favor, because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it. so every time you think someone will finally take him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it.in one of my favorite episodes, lucas and caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them. lucas used it as an excuse to teach caleb a lesson about evil.the robber (ted) was hesitant to shoot them. lucas told caleb that ted had half a conscience. if he had no conscience, he would have shot them by now. if he had a real conscience, he never would have become a criminal. so he started calling him half-ted. it was pretty funny. he was taunting the criminals. and of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half-ted at all times. and of course he was in complete control at all times. they actually had you favoring satan.very very excellent show. it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernaturalthat's good company.

i loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when i found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued! for years i hung onto my copies of this show, ones that i had taped or had someone tape for me. that is until now. the powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on dvd and i finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set. which, brings me to this part; the part about that this show is all about.american gothic is about good verses evil, basically a struggle between lucas buck (that is buck, with a b). he is an evil sheriff of a south carolina small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way.i felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived. i really hated when it was canceled, but that is the way it seems to go for me when i finally find something worth watching on television.gary cole did a great job as the role of sheriff lucas buck, he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off. the other actors did a super job as well, so i guess you could say, even the casting was a hit with me.

definitely spoilers in this review! i **adore** american gothic and have done since i first saw it late at night when it first aired on ch4 in the uk when i was 14. the comparisons made to stephen king are just about right. it's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters. best of all, and the reason i love it so much, is it had the guts to never be black and white! lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by, as he says, giving people enough rope to hang themselves with. his manipulation only works because of other people's weak morals. caleb though generally a thoughtful, kind, insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father. none of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in the plague sower. not only that but having gail, the closest thing to a mother figure for caleb, not only sleep with but fall in love with lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it. i'm a huge buffy fan, but when that show tried to go really 'dark' in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it's humorous side and didn't commit fully to its ideas. ag shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show, and still have a hell of laugh doing it.i can't even think about why it was cancelled as i'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all. so much rubbish on tv and good, original shows get kicked around and stamped on. thanks to the emergence of dvd at least i can see the show in it's entirety! yes some of the visuals look dated now, but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines. the actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work.the only reason why i think someone may not like this show is that it isn't like the x-files where there are cases to 'solve' or lost where there's huge unanswered questions. it's pretty obvious from the get go that lucas buck has some kind of evil powers, and that the show is all about fighting for caleb's soul. so this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown 'truth' to find. yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects, with some such as the truth about gails parents getting resolved, but unlike lost and x-files this show isn't about trying to find out more 'facts' about what's going on imo. it's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of trinity. personally i would just get such a kick out of seeing lucas turn every situation to his advantage.all in all the main thing i have to say is check it out. i'm pretty certain most fantasy/horror fans will love it. also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure. the only hanging thread i felt was dr matt. having him not be in the final episodes is strange. i would have done anything for a second season, but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some tv execs appear to be i should be glad this wonderful show got made at all!!!

i stumbled on this series rather by accident. after half an episode, i was hooked. american gothic was a dark, strange series with gary cole as the mysterious, probably evil sheriff buck who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son caleb, played by lucas black. i was impressed with gary cole's sinister sheriff and i was even more impressed with lucas black. lucas black's caleb was able to stand up against sheriff buck, one of the most frightening characters ever created for a tv series. i have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as lucas black. if you were not lucky enough to see lucas in american gothic, see him in slingblade.it was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during it's short run.

the invaders is a fast moving sci-fi thriller starring ben cross and sean young. ben plays renn, a traveller from another galaxy trying to find annie (played by sean) who is physically ideal to have his child. this child, if allowed to be born and returned to his planet, may be the only chance for his race to survive. the enemy, an alien who has destroyed renn's people, has also followed renn across the stars to stop this birth. cross again shows great range from comical beginnings as the alien enters a local bar and orders his first earthling cocktail, to his race with the enemy and the drama of whether he can keep annie and the child she is carrying alive.

i'm a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s film noir themes that i like to see, so i enjoyed it.in general though, the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a neanderthal, hence the kitch warning.

to be fair, i expected car chases in this film. there was only really one, but apart from that, 'freeway' was a great movie which i am glad to own on dvd. the only really big names in the cast are homicide's richard belzer as the radio psychiatrist and b-movie villain par-excellance billy drago as the revelation-quoting freeway killer. but the rest of the cast generally give good performances. i especially liked how darlanne fluegel gave her character, sunny, a bit of guts. she could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out drago with the help of bounty hunter james russo.russo, i'm afraid, comes across as rather wooden, but then again, the character he plays, frank, isn't very well fleshed out save for a back story sunny is given by his former commanding officer. the tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely la freeway at night with the killer prowling its' length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension, and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed. i don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so. different strokes for different folks, i suppose. but i absolutely enjoyed 'freeway' and i can strongly recommend it.

i was so excited to see this film because i had always heard it was very scary.what's interesting about it is that it is a japanese film they decided to bring to america, but they actually filmed it in japan with the original crew! i think this made the film... more japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most japan-to-america horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to american audiences. the difference in what scares the japanese culture and what scares the american culture felt present throughout the film. this worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, tokyo pond.the storyline was quite confusing as well. in typical japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. the beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the end of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. this constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. also, i didn't think some things were explained so well and i had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story).overall, there is plenty for american audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.

karen goes into a japanese house as a substitute nurse to emma, a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night. karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she encounters a frightening ghost. she will learn the house's secrets.it is very scary! the scenes are shocking and frightening! the characters are good. the settings are creepy. i love the whole plot! the ending was shocking! i paused at a scene where the little boy meowed so loudly to the man finding his sister upstairs and i was shocked. this is the scariest movie i have watched. i did not see the japanese version. i recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!

haven't seen any of the japanese grudge-films, but i really enjoy this one. i rarely get scared when watching films. i can jump, if the effect and sound is startling enough, but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me. but i did get scared from grudge. maybe because i didn't expect anything at all when i watched it. i didn't expect getting scared. i didn't know anything about it either. that was probably a good thing.this is a film that you, apparently, either love or hate. most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge-films, but even though i haven't seen them, i believe it isn't right to compare any film, actually. this film stands on it its own.the story is weak, most people say. i don't agree. the story is minimalistic, and done so on purpose. the story-telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done. the director knows exactly what he's doing, and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it.i gave this film 8 of 10. it is a film you will enjoy watching, or hate. it's as simple as that.

omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever, ever seen. to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement, and i have seen heaps (considering the limited availability in new zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before have i had to sleep with the light on...until i saw the grudge.some may say that it is a rip off of the ring (both based on japanese horror movies), both similar (yet different) story lines, but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema, i even screamed at a certain point in the movie.the acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. jason behr is a real hottie, and william mapother looks like he is having fun. however, while i am normally a fan of clea duvall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie. of the supporting characters, hers probably got the most depth and back story, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. as for sarah michelle gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she? the ghosts were genuinely scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (particularly the noise being made when kadee strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the ending was cool too.super highly recommended. 9/10

i wanted to see sarah buffy on the big screen, so i first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at imdb. i worried about seeing a bad movie. well, i had fun watching the movie. some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in buffy the vampire slayer.i don't consider this a bad movie. it's not a great movie either. just a rather well made horror movie. it does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. in my opinion, the acting was ok. sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. the other actors were definitely not bad either, i liked yoko.the sets are nice (and i don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the japanese original).the scary moments were often predictable. but not always. i have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. nice.the movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother.don't go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode, because it is very different from her buffy work, much more serious. don't go if you only want to see movies that gather oscar nominations. it's a good horror movie, enough suspense. i gave it a 7.

as i've noticed with a lot of imdb comments, certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness. i am not one of those people. if i watch an action film, i want to see explosions, gunfire and heroics. if i watch a comedy, i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. you get the idea. therefore watching a horror film, i primarily want to be scared. the grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. i've been a horror film fan for many years, and i'm talking about the masters such as dario argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days. if you want to be scared, watch this film. way scarier than the original japanese 'ring' (which i also think is a great film).

i saw "the grudge" yesterday, and wow... i was really scared, a good thing. i love horror-movies, and i really liked this one. there were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the english word?) that made you jump in your seat. though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. i think the most scary scene was... on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, or when yoko's walking without her chin. the make-up is also very good. sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. the boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared...

i'm not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically anti-grudge people are talking about here, perhaps it's just that some people like to rant about things.the movie was certainly imperfect (uneven acting, some may have had difficulties with the time-changes, actors all too willing to go places i'd really rather not go, etc.) but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections.first and foremost, i loved the 'breaking of the rules' bit. normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends, and find the token mysterious paranormal type. normally (semi-spoiler alert) when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through. normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood, or they've been freed, or whatever.secondly, the production was exceptional. while the movie was hardly special-effects-laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done.probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror (nothing against 'em, they've got their place), but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time distortions.

this was great. when i saw the japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie i had ever seen. it was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. when the mother ghost lent over the bed in the japanese version, i nearly had a heart attack... i was concerned that the american version would be watered down, and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version. i needn't have been concerned. the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man. they also set it in japan in the same location, in the same house. in fact, the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of american actors. that actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of "strangers in a strange land" to the overall horror. not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and i thought it was an excellent touch.buffy actually does a very good job. she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. there are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to american horror movies, or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. in fact, it was easily as good as the ring which i also thoroughly enjoyed. i hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of ringu. we are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as "horror"!! 8/10

so, being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump (or fidget nervously.)definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out... a hell of a lot better than the ring. the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then so be it... i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared, so i have to say that this one is worth watching.now, you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line, because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story (i think that if it was shown in chronological order, it would have ruined the whole thing.)i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it... maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid.

massive multiple chills down the spine! i'm surprised there's people who didn't like it! i saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff! and i've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies! for crying out loud,i'm 22!!! i mean, ok, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. but the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! from the very start, hitting you again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorising scenes! so many clichés yet none fails to surprise/scare! you know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, boo! and you still jump off the chair. grab a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night! hats off to the japanese!

this is what i wrote to some friends earlier:holy crap, the grudge is, honest to god, one of the scariest films i've ever seen! i am either getting very soft in my old age, or sam raimi and ghost pictures did a kick a** job! (can't wait for boogeyman!)i was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished i had someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist in grudge. i saw the movie by myself.) i swear, there were many many jump scenes that were not expected! i felt foolish but my nerves did not care! i was on edge the entire movie, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically scary. i keep thinking of that sound, though, and i do not like it!i actually gasped aloud a few times, and cried, "oh" at one scene!! oh, yeah, i even half-covered my eyes a few times! word to the wise, though: i thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic. my dh hated event horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho, but i don't remember the movie so can't compare.i can't say i "enjoyed" this movie b/c i was terrified, but it was very very good and scary. the ending scene, too...whoa! for being a 32-year-old-mommy, i think i may have nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. please get out of my head ;)in summary, this is not a slasher flick like i grew up with (jason, freddy). this is a most-of-the-time spooky movie. perfect for halloween.two great trailers for this movie were boogeyman and the ring 2!!

"the grudge" is a remake of shimizu's own series of popular japanese horror films. shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new, so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride. he uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner. the nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. at the end, all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience (the same way a comedy is to make people laugh), this movie succeeded with flying colors. i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one. it probably doesn't play as well in your living room.

karen (sarah michelle gellar), an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, emma (grace zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, yoko (yoko maki), disappears. karen soon learns that something is not right in emma's home, and she attempts to "see how deep the rabbit hole goes".maybe it's a delayed influence from the success of m. night shyamalan's films, but slower-paced, understated horror films are a recent trend. in some cases, such as hide and seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as white noise (2005), the pacing tends to kill the film. i didn't like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek, but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. one, it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with ju-on (2000) (in particular, it's extremely close to the first half of ju-on: the grudge, aka ju-on 3, from 2003). two, as with many japanese horror films, the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror, the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.director takashi shimizu, also the director of the five japanese entries in the ju-on series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is atmosphere, creepiness, the uncanny, and for many viewers--scares. how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to, or are used to, this different approach to film-making (although admittedly, some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the ju-on series). traditionally, american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning "rules" for the "monster". a more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the u.s.however, even if you're not used to it, it's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot. this is a well written, well directed, well acted film, filled with unusual properties, such as the story interweaving a large number of "main characters" (which is done better here than the more episodic ju-on 3), good cinematography, subtle production design touches (check out gellar's clothes, which match the color and texture of the exterior of emma's house, when gellar first approaches), and beautifully effective horror material.even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing, and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu, have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore. although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture, it's interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.i subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a "here's what really happened" flashback, but even that was fairly well done, and otherwise, this would have been a 10 out of 10.now that i've said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: it's not that i'm anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that u.s. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. the original versions of these films should just be playing in u.s. theaters in wide release. there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for non-white or foreign actors. yes, the grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, i'd rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just japanese, but also indian, spanish, chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.

i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film. what i got was scare after scare. it's a horror film at it's core. it's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. this film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters. i think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. they become haunted no matter where they are. office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc. after reading some of the external reviews i am really surprised that critics didn't like this film. i am going to see it again this week and am excited about it.i gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should. it scared the s**t out of me.

i found this movie to be exciting right from the start--like a spielberg movie is--and found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual situation was.right from the start--before the opening credits-- the action starts, bringing with it immediate suspense.the two main characters are very likable. (i have trouble liking any of the baldwins, due to alec's extra-curricular, political activities, but william was not too bad in this movie.)there were several highly unexpected twists, which contributed to the enjoyment.there were, unfortunately, many places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack--something like 19k hz. i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set.

michael bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy ray wise) at a sprawling, windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy clare wren), thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family. an edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable tv--where i first saw it. it is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails. i cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it. it is an undiscovered classic.

this film had my heart pounding. the acting was great, the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner. the lead actress decides to join an escort service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her. she step's into a whole new world her first client being another woman. this is a film you definitely don't want to pass up.

heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of "secret games". it becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away! i didn't expect the delightful scene i was about to encounter. the "call girl" has her first customer and what a customer! one of the most erotic lesbian scenes i have ever seen. the husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey. it turned out to cost them in the end but, it was one exciting ride! go see this movie!!!

i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot - i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. yet i remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. i definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary "edginess" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.

these two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good tv series, so let's compare.freddy - 7 movies robocop - 3 moviesfreddy - 1 tv series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes robocop - 1 tv series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodesfreddy - 2 extra films (freddy vs jason, freddy vs ghostbusters) robocop - 4 extra films (robocop: prime directives: dark justice, meltdown, crach & burn, resurrection)freddy - 1 upcoming film robocop - 1 upcoming filmwho's had more screen time? well they've both had 7 movies, 1 tv series, and 1 upcoming film. but freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) & 17-18 tv episodes.since this is a comment for the series, between freddy's nightmares - anoes: the series & robocop: the series i would personally choose robocop...

i'm a bit conflicted over this. the show is on one hand awful, the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like brad pitt and bill moseley in one episode), the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. there's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and robert englund's cameos are short, pointless and corny in a sort of a bob saget on america's funniest home videos kind of way.on the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. the 80s fashions, the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of the view at all times, the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares, so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his sat's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him, another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by brad pit), another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home, another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin, another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. the list goes on and on.being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices, but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. you have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it).if you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. if you're looking, on the other hand, for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. watch it.its been showing on chiller tv lately (pretty much every day) and i've been watching, earlier out of morbid curiosity, and now just so i can get a good laugh in each day. with arrested development and extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now.

i know technically this isn't the greatest tv show ever,i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it.the acting can at time be also a little crumby.but,i love this show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988.of course it would i was 5 years old.but i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodes,which unfortunately i hear is now deleted.and i also heard warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first dvd's bad sales.also the tv show didn't have the same feel as the movies,in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone.even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4(both that film and the tv show were made the same year),this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing,i like freddy as the clown wise cracker.but i think that was the strenght of this tv show,you didn't have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody.in fact this has more of a dream feel to it,reinforced by the soft focus of the lense.im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video. i love this show,and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable.much better than anything on tv today.

i don't see how you can say that freddy's nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off. you obviously don't know good tv when you see it. the episodes are packed with drama and blood. freddy is creative in the way he kills people. i love freddy's nightmares and i hope to get all 44 episodes on dvd. the best episodes are: saturday night special,school daze, and love stinks. if you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember it's only your opinion and it means nothing. freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll come to accept that fact soon enough. if you don't like it then don't watch it but don't deny it's brilliance.

this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right. friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies. poltergeist the legacy: i'm not so sure. it may have been loosely connected to the movies. it feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it.it shows freddy being burned by the elm street parents(in the 1st episode i believe) and the amount of parents were disappointing. with all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies, you'd expect there to be more parents. but oh well.freddy is basically the narrator for the show. he watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow. just like other anthology shows like tales from the crypt, there's a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved.the acting lacks but believe it or not: the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie. this show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie. i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents. i watched a lot of r rated stuff as a kid, so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the series , so it wasn't a total loss.

i still have grainy, late night, no-cable, cheap vhs dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when, late-night-commercials and all, when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on -- just so i could tape it.the series wasn't really about freddy kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod serling-esquire announcer. instead, each episode was a distinct nightmare, using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating, and... hmm... dating.from the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says "i will love you forever" to the wrong girl, and is stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together...), to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man, only to find herself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses, and one i only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey (and the injuries and penalties that go with it) - dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series.one episode had jeffrey combs (re-animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient. not original, but still creepy and fun....even so, some of the episodes were great. my personal favorite was "it's a miserable life" where a young man is trapped working in his parents' burger joint, when he wants to go off to college. stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same. no, not freddy, just a thug with a gun - turns out the whole mind-blowing episode is just that - the last thoughts that pass through the kid's head... along with a bullet.the second half of the same episode (many of the freddie's nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories) followed his girlfriend, who was also wounded, but not killed in the drive-by, and who is taken to "the hospital from heck" - they cram in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clichés, and then some - from accidentally having your mouth sewn shut - or waking up during an operation - to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the morgue for a little cuddle.again, that was my favorite.some of the episodes were much dumber, like almost all of the ones they've made available on video. they put the crummy ones out as representative of the series, and then nobody likes them, thinks the show stunk, and then they don't put any more on video. it's a miserable life is only available on pal dvd in england - but i'm still gonna buy it.

i must admit, out of the eros movie collection, this has to be the one that i love the most as well as one other that i have also reviewed. the story is something that really keeps you watching. a lot of the eros films have a plot that looks like a hammer broke it in pieces before production when you watch it. all centering around sex, and who can get with how many different people come the end of the film. and oh dear god, never watch one of these films when someone pulls out a gun. it does not work that it is almost laughable, but you do not want to waste the energy to do so."losing control" is exactly as its name comes on. the protagonist, the leading character (the wonderfully talented and beautiful kira reed). the control is the control a person has over their senses, their body and feelings. and one man changes everything for her, makes her a different woman almost. but the mirror is shattered at the same time. this makes for a great film that i wish i had come up with first!!10/10

all kira reed fans must see this. the film's premise has struggling romance novelist kira unable to come up with any new ideas. she's also getting over a divorce. however, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). they go into a corner room and they do it. thankfully, kira gets a condom out (now don't ever tell me these playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. remember kids, safe sex). later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name. despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. but eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. when she does, all hell breaks loose, and i'll leave it at that. this is easily the best of these soft-core playboys films i've seen. check this out, and marvel at the greatness of kira.

when it comes to the erotic genre, i'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch. this movie is different. julie davis (i love you don't touch me) directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller. kira is convincing as "kim" a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jeffery's "the man" a handsome stranger. kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role, and as actress, giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability. i believe it to be her best performance yet. and julie davis' direction is a great gift to erotica.

are we really making 'video nasties' again? in the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8mm, this is quite a ride. unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of paris, hamburg and amsterdam. i am however being rather churlish for the 'depraved' scenes, including everything from, hot wax, harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning, beheading and some. these scenes are immaculate and it's a pity bruno and his budget couldn't stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures.

who would've imagined -- hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. the fusion is highly entertaining.having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade, i approached this one with some caution. his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. the director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of long island, new york or in new york city itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". to my pleasant surprise, hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. it works in more ways than one might imagine. hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana. truly he is coming into his own. the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley's vision and style. fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before.

fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley's henry fool. i haven't seen the earlier film, and i don't know if that's a good thing or not. i can only regard the current film on its own merits.for most people, hal hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like or you don't. his combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humour really resonates with me, and fay grim is no exception. it has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud. for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. it's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes.during the second half of the film, the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller. whether this was hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear, but i think a bit of editing or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum.the performances were generally good, particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum, who had the most screen time. saffron burrows, james urbaniak, carl montgomery and elina löwensohn all played good support roles. the film's visuals were nice (set in new york, paris, berlin and istanbul) and the music (also by hartley) was good without being intrusive. the film is well-written and i enjoyed this it immensely. if you like hartley's earlier work, you'll probably like this.

it seems hal hartley's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences. this film will be no exception to that rule. fay grim acts as a sequel to hartley's 'henry foole' from 1998. the focus this time is on henry's ex wife (played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey), who is being pestered by cia goons about henry's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings. in the interim of all of this, fay ends up on an odyssey,dealing with international spies,etc. the film does get a bit bogged down in the second half. if you've been a fan of hal hartley in the past, this is one not to be missed. for the novice hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique, you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one (especially if you haven't seen 'henry' yet). i admired the camera work,which at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography.

i've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to henry fool, and even though it technically is, i think that fay grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film. just because it is the sequel doesn't mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first, and i enjoyed that so much about it. the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first, which makes sense because the movie isn't called henry fool 2, it's fay grim. all that aside, the film, i thought, was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me. i was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story-line (aka parker's last direct to video feature the oh in ohio) but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn't seem so, which i absolutely loved. there are so many nuances in the film making and writing that i crave to see in films, but never do. the cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'grim' throughout - in terms of setting. the writing was so well put together as well, whoever said this movie isn't as witty as henry fool needs to watch again and actually listen; i almost can't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was, and pertinent. and well, parker posey, who could complain? the scene in which fool and jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional. and i thought the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on (in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost). the main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film, and i believe the point of the film, was parker's love and naivety about fool, which was so endearing and turned, yes very quickly, from denial to outright passion. the last five minutes of the film were perfect. obviously there were things that weren't excellent, but nothing is perfect; some of the acting was poor, and at times i did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand, but in the end you got it and didn't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension. (this may also have to do with goldblum's tendency to talk extremely fast) on the whole i would say that it was probably one of the best films i've seen this year; stylistically pleasing, clever and witty writing, performances that were so impressive i now have gained new respect for some of the actors, and a truly touching film, and don't forget, a complete departure from fool. which was the point.

generically speaking, fay grim is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most inexorably enjoyable names in american movies, unshakably beautiful and gracefully spunky parker posey and endlessly charismatic and unavoidably hilarious jeff goldblum. they have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two insatiable presences volleying off of each other, even radiating with charm when goldblum rolls off hartley's shamelessly epic info-dumps. nevertheless, if one were to deconstruct fay grim, one would see many instances in which countless scenes could've been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in being.this sort of filmed in-joke is the sequel to hal hartley's henry fool, which was made ten years earlier. it has title character posey forced by cia agent goldblum to track down the notebooks that were the precious possessions of her missing fugitive husband, the predecessor's titular anti-hero. available within them is information that could concede the safety of the united states. fay first makes for paris to get a hold of them but becomes engulfed in a bona fide celebration of espionage clichés featuring everything from car bombs to ambiguous helpers to following the girl to double-crosses to triple-crosses.the primary appeal of it all for me is that it's such a novel approach to the sequel of a movie about a garbageman and a struggling novelist in a small town. in the original henry fool, posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life. hartley's talents do not reach the heights of many of the other independent newbies from the 1990s, but i do admire his wild creativity in making an inadvertent nearne sister out of her, giving her a terrific predicament, as he did to her character's brother, played by james urbaniak, in henry fool, as she is trapped between whether or not she may still love her overwhelming refugee husband and the problematic but forceful plans of goldblum.hartley, however, is simply riding on that fragmentary idea. his plot, though complex and labyrinthine, true to the form of the spy film, it seems as if to be entirely capricious. the reason i was not bored was mostly due to the pace at which the story unfolds, not to mention the presence of posey and goldblum. the problem with the remainder of hartley's cast is that i cannot seem to become fond of the rest of them. it has nothing to do with how obscure they are compared to the relative star power of the two said charm masters, but with how they don't seem to hold their own alongside them, though saffron burrows certainly comes close. most of the scenes not involving posey or goldblum are far too light on their feet, stringing us along with info-dumps we have no choice but to listen to or else be totally lost in the ensuing sequence of scenes. they are shot almost entirely in tiled angles, as if hartley is compensating for that implacable feeling of a lack of material.liam aiken, however, playing the now teenage son of fay and henry, has a certain allure about him, seeming wise beyond his years, certainly much wiser than any of the adult characters. perhaps hartley intended that, or maybe it's simply aiken's presence. the problem with a hartley film is that you never quite know what was intended and what just happens to be there. as scorsese said, "cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out." one has to be able to trust that what we see is a conscious decision by the filmmaker to remain in the finished film.

henry fool surprised me. i didn't expect it to entertain and amuse as well, or as strongly, as it did. fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it. once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, however, it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film. at least as good as ginger snaps back, if not better.i am a little disappointed that jeff goldblum's part is so small, but i'm happy he is a part of this short run. he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright. also a delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim, the son of fay and henry.this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons. i am pleased, for example, to discover that henry isn't really the loser he seems (by the end of fool), and to further discover that he is, in fact, a genius...well, that really is a lovely stroke of the pen.i am hoping they do a third...like the end of the trilogy. it seems to be missing. they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father, to validate the awesome change in his mother, and the sense of near-genius he himself feels welling inside him. assuming, of course, that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son, concerning his father. it feels like it needs to be done. i'd buy it.even with more action, this is still not an action flick. it is more drama and intrigue...a mystery, of sorts. i'll watch it often.it rates an 8.3/10 from...the fiend :.

after seeing this film months ago, it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and i feel i must buy it or at least see it again, even though i watched it at least 3 times when i rented it at that point.i fell in love with hal hartley's directing many years ago - i found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained. it is a strange feeling, granted, and i assume most people out there really just don't get it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - i guess i just really get it - its as if these films were made for me.although i don't remember if i actually laughed out loud during this film, it remains one of the funniest films i've seen in many years. if you don't see the humor of the grocery bag fay carries from the street to a church, to her brother's publisher's office, to her son's principal's office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film. the bag is a silent character in itself, being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash, bitchy parker posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her.i consider "henry fool" my least favorite of hartley's films. i honestly don't remember it very well - i think the character himself was so despicable i found it tedious. hartley's forte seems to be feminine character development.aside from posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see elina lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. her extravagant naiveté is perfect for hartley's direction. his ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout.this film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story, explaining political situations in afganistan. this is never suspected at the beginning. the complexity of this film's development is unparalleled.this is the epitome of a "stand alone" sequel. the less you know about henry fool the more mystery is spun around him, the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-smoking complaint machine, hurling insults at his islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him. its like finding out santa claus is actually a 12-year-old schoolyard bully.although i was impressed and satisfied with hartley's other recent films "the girl from monday" and "no such thing", "fay grim" goes far beyond what i expected, with a sense of humor and originality no oscar winner would ever dare.

fay, the sister of the notorious nobel prize-winning smut poet simon grim, still loves henry fool. their son receives an ingenious orgy-in-a-box from an undisclosed sender and a chase across three continents ensues, involving a supremely sad-sack collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants, and bellhops.parker posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance, including some brilliant physical work. with strong contributions by jasmin tabatabai and saffron burrows, fay grim proves in the best billy wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble.another good score by hartley (and thanks in the credits to the american academy in berlin, where hartley served as a fellow in fall 2004).

fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film. it has all the pieces of acting, direction, storyline, and entertainment value. they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece, fay grim.this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing. soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henry's. these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings. fay is sent to find these journals, in return to release her brother from prison, and is sent on a cat-and-mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about.parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show. she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers, but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies. posey made me believe what was happening on screen, i felt for her, i rooted for her, and i wanted to know more. she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her.i haven't seen any other previous works by writer/director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was.if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i'd highly urge you to choose fay grim. if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely.

i'm one of those people who'd crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film. from trust and iris to henry fool and (my hartley favorite) no such thing, hal's unique brand of movies are an acquired taste. infusing equal parts mystery/espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte. the comedy isn't in your face necessarily, and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition. and that's the case with fay grim, the sequel to henry fool.parker posey stars as fay grim, abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to henry's only son ned. fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen. his name is fulbright (jeff goldblum, man of the year) and he wants henry's notebooks. there are many henry fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings. apparently there's much more to them. secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists? who knows but henry. agent fulbright tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly surmised as a ruse to get fay out of her home and searching for henry (and it works ...but not the way they think).fay battles multiple spy rings to gather henry's notebooks and to seek him out. she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon (james urbaniak) out of prison (he'd helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film.) multiple overlapping events occur in rapid succession: spy rings shoot each other to death, henry is discovered being held in "safety" by a jihadist, fay frees her brother but unknowingly risks her son's life, and the cia gets its comeuppance for putting fay in danger.hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes. and he does so to the extreme here. even character names (grim, fool, fulbright, fogg) have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny. the over-the-top espionage films of ol' are given plenty of screen time, too, as guns blaze in stop-motion sequences, never striking our heroine even though she's right in the line of fire.now that i've heaped praise on this creation, i will say that parker posey's excessive portrayal of fay grim isn't the best part of the film, which is a shame considering how much time she's on-screen. i realize this was probably what mr. hartley wanted: an uncurbed woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme. but it was still painful to watch at times.even so, fans will probably devour fay grim and beg for more. though this wasn't my favorite hal hartley film, i know i'm ready.

as someone who has seen and followed hartley's public work for several years i think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind games.while entertaining, fay grim is another step in the henry fool line of thinking, where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself. in henry fool, the object is the memoirs... in fay grim, the object is encrypted memoirs - which are themselves stolen, forged and trans-mutated into something so obscure it can't really make any sense - i.e. the process of script writing and film-making in the modern era - where most blockbuster films are little more than a mash-up of the past. that is, in a philosophical sense, what fay grim is all about. the object, perhaps, is the tragedy that shock is now cliché and dull (as hinted in the opening scenes at the publishers office).that being said, many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand henry's character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for. henry is a thinly veiled devil, first visiting simon as a modern faust, etc. without understanding how tragic henry's character is, much of the quality of fay grim's plot and story is lost.and there is not enough 'detail' expressed through verbal flashbacks - knowing the plot of henry fool cannot compare to 'feeling' the quality of the characters as one did in henry fool, and so i think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of 'so what' responses to highly constructed dialog and then that's it.however, henry fool was also my least favorite hartley film until i realized that it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because henry fool's confessions were bad... not just raunchy or dirty, but inescapably broken. henry can not even be a proper villain - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing... like gollum in tolkien's works, henry is pitiable.that doesn't come across in fay grim, although henry's dialog is excellent. what does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption - a sort of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to henry's confessions. it is an interesting twist, but one that can't really be digested without viewing the first film. perhaps showing more of henry earlier on would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic storyline of the first movie - although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about - unless perhaps one is a casual observer.part of the encryption? hard to say... a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though. cheesy.

henry fool is a better film. but this is the perfect way to follow-up a film like 'henry fool.' to take henry very seriously, his 'lies' and his mysterious aura. even the opening shot of 'henry fool' when simon puts his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through 'fay grim.' the over-the-top jokes, that are more or less meta-jokes (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them. also hartley's use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring, yes, it's intention, but it feels forced and over-used, it goes beyond jarring to, what i'd like to call, annoying. it's a flawed film, but a must see for any hartley or 'henry fool' fan. and don't listen to stupid reviews, don't watch this unless you've seen the first film. the intrigue, satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven't seen henry fool. it's a sequel. that's just dumb.

hal hartley's henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work. it has immense character depth, subtle, complicated dialogue, and an excellent, emotional ending which captivates. i remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what i was seeing and feeling. henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish, and needed no sequel.thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim. fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of real-world vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he matures. in her own movie, fay matures herself, though her maturity takes a very different road. simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhat-introverted genius. fay starts her adult journey as an immature, utterly normal, spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature, utterly normal, experienced adult who holds no advantages. she deals with problems the way any human does, with determination, a little thought, and weary disdain. while simon learned to control his mind, fay learns to control her emotion.the movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel, but differs vastly in tone for most of the film. henry fool showed you a harsh, boring, ignorant world which contrasted with simon's inner passion and creativity. in fay grim, the world is a lively, crazy, emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life, and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak mother.the movie is in two parts, the first dealing with the beginning of fay's struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility, and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain henry. at first, fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel, and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy. but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies. the sequel is about fay's journey, and as i said before, hers is one of finding the life-giving sanity in chaos, not the creative chaos in staid order. parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartley's tongue in cheek humor perfectly. elina löwensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role, allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively, stage-like comedy happening around her.with the entrance of henry into the picture, the movie begins to take a sobering turn. hal hartley's movies are all plays, and every play must come full circle. by the end, you are shown fay's newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense henry, whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets.fay grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass henry fool, but shows through hal's range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius.honestly, i think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile (and especially the subtlety in parker posey's acting), but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool.

when i started watching "fay grim", i had no idea that it was a sequel to "henry fool". now, the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel. but one has arrived, and it's quite good. i assume that you've seen the original, so i won't explain it. this one starts with fay (parker posey) living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry (thomas jay ryan). simon (james urbaniak) is still in jail. one day, the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. but this is no ordinary toy. it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than "syriana".i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here. maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality, but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world. and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel.also starring jeff goldblum.

a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels. parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. the story is very tongue in cheek, and the dialog skillfully understated. hints of humor and intrigue, neither of which overpower the characterization posey pulls off so well. the supporting cast is stellar. the downside? this film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body. she's worth your time, even if you don't understand the denouement.

perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasn't so attached to the characters in henry fool. to those who've never seen henry fool, i wouldn't worry. as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff, the film has lots of exposition and explanations.this film is very heavy in plot, which keeps the film moving. there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartley's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue. over all, a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work. as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur, this film could go either way. i have mixed feelings about the film and hartley's later films in general. what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations, focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other. since his late 90s and onward, his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter. mass media in no such thing, religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim. i don't know if hartley's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he's able to do it justice.strangely enough, the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships, a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves. the only problem is, i've seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film. you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel. somehow, the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henry's books of confessions as a macguffin (in the hitchcockian sense). fay's motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool.i guess i'm slightly disappointed in the film because it's not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesn't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller. there's too much irony and wryness in hartley's approach to such as big topic as terrorism. it somehow works and doesn't work at the same time. all i could say, you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartley's work and how well you know hartley's work. fans of henry fool, be severely warned for a disappointment. for the rest, welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride.

convoluted, infuriating and implausible, fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. she's at once touching,funny, cunning. the supporting actors commit to it as well.i wont even try to tell you the plot.. it involves characters from hartley's henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage.the film works well if you continue along with it-understanding it is. in a sense, completely ridiculous. it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along. (i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice).fay grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that isn't cookie-cutter. in the end, it offers something that defies description.

i'm an admirer of hal hartley's films, especially 1997's "henry fool." "fay grim" is a sequel to that film, and has a similar style and sense of humor. the plot, however, is completely different. fay grim (played brilliantly by the iconic parker posey) tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks, and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage. the supporting cast (most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum, saffron burrows, and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling elina lowensohn) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises. the director claims this is part of a "star wars"-like trilogy, serving as the "empire strikes back" of the series if this is true, i can't wait to see the third installment! i just hope i don't have to wait 10 more years for it.

i just saw this film @ tiff (toronto international film festival). fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed!! and if you are not familiar with this director's oeuvre ... doesn't matter. this film can definitely stand all on its own. i have to go the second screening ... it was amazing i need to see it again -- and fast!! this film is very funny. it's dialogue is very smart, and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim. fay grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool (2000). visually, the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted (or dutch) angle, which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts, available in the possible films: short works by hal hartley 1994-2004 collection, and in the girl from monday (2005).i viewed this film most aptly on sept 11th. textually, fay grim's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after september 11, 2001. without going into major spoilers, i view this work, and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely, if ever, foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore (cf. syrianna: of side note - mark cuban exec. prod in both these films ... most interesting, to say the least). lastly, for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool, simone, fay and henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential. that being said, the character of fay grimm starts off in the film, exactly where she was when henry fool ended, but by the end of the film ... fay's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative. what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family ... ?? i can't wait for the third part in this story!

the 1997 low-key indie dramedy henry fool would seemingly have been a secure choice of movies no one would bother to revisit for a sequel. a rumpled, dissipated drifter (thomas jay ryan) strolls into town. his anarchistic rantings and delusions inspire a nerdy garbage collector (james urbaniak) to write poems, while henry half-heartedly tries to boink the guy's sister (parker posey). as the poet prospers, henry declines. nothing special about any of the characters or the story. a pitch for harold and maude's ghost would have been quoted higher odds of ever making it to a screen.but parker posey ain't the semi-official queen of the indies for nothing'. so when writer/director hal hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a film was born. though we catch up with the same characters many years, they're in a completely different sort of dark comedy; this one's laced with espionage! henry may have been an international spy - and possible double, or even triple, agent - for years before meeting the others. he's either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries. everyone wants his rambling, incoherent journal which just may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies. posey's fay is either the wife he left to go on the lam, or his widow, depending on who's telling the truth. fay's efforts to find henry and/or the hotly-contested journals include a globe-trotting gauntlet of multinational hit-persons and henchmen at every turn. she never knows who to believe or trust. nor do we.while herding these unlikely characters into jason bourne/jack ryan territory, hartley's script retains the ironic deadpan humor of their first appearance, steering clear of slapstick in exposing them to physical menaces. his sly lampoon of the paranoia, duplicity and musical-chairs alliances of today's geopolitics starts to crumble towards the end. even so, fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of hartley's recycling methods. (5/18/07)

when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool, i was excited (it's been a personal favorite for years now), and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism. having just seen it though, i was surprised to find that it worked, while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool. the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb...especial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast, right down to henry's son, who was only four in the original. like i said though, this movie is quite different from the first, but it works: i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended. in this case, an unexpected adventure ensues...and that's about all i'll give away...not to mention the fact that i'll need to see it again to really understand what's going on and who's double crossing who. while it was certainly one of the better movies i've seen in some time, it suffers like many sequels with its ending, as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging. i'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ('henry grim'?) in 2017.

fay grim is, on its face, a tale of espionage and intrigue told with a nod and a wink. as the sequel to his extraordinary henry fool, hal hartley creates a surprising blend of film noir and hardboiled spy thriller that starts with a knowing smile and large dose of laughter and turns as poignant and warm as any film i've seen this year.parkey posey is fay grim, an unwitting mata hari caught between the love of her exiled husband henry fool and the questionable intentions of a charming cia operative. as agent fulbright, jeff goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm, in a role that seems tailored to his talents. he has never been better. james urbaniak is fay's brother simon, jailed but renowned for his wildly popular books of poetry. his love of his work and his sister brings a jolt of passion to contrast the dour nature of the spies which eventually populate fay's world. and liam aiken is fay's oversexed 14 year-old son. although that may be redundant. aiken's understated style is remarkably "old soul" for someone his age.the entire film is shot dutch angle, the off-kilter style made famous by orson welles and used primarily in horror films and psychological thrillers to impart a sense of foreboding. in fay grim, using that style from opening credits to closing is intriguing at first, deceptively clever the next. for just as the viewer begins to fall for the perfectly timed comedic elements and wit of hartley's brilliant script, something happens. the film takes a dark yet strangely comforting turn as these characters magically become sympathetic before our eyes. what began as dark comedy morphs into romantic drama, and the transition is masterful. slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action, and we are sucked right into the vortex.in the end, hartley's sharp dialog combined with the amazing performances of a perfectly matched ensemble cast makes for a delicious cinematic cocktail. told with the luxury of one able to write, produce, direct, edit, and even compose the music, hal hartley has crafted a smart, sexy tale of espionage with tongue just barely planted in cheek. fay grim is one part dashiell hammett, one part raymond chandler, and one part ian fleming, shaken and maybe stirred as well.

a pleasant surprise! i expected a further downgrade along the line: the rock (9)-->con air (7)-->armaggeddon (4). especially for such an overhyped film. perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare. clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it. fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. this is one for the more intelligent action fans. it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little.

the movie was a big car commercial. :-)but who cares? i went to the theater to view the shelby cobra, angelina & cage.so i guess it was a good movie. *bg*

i liked this movie. it was pretty cool. it has it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. it does not excel in any of this things, with the exception of the cars. a bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and lot´s of car, with a great chase near the end. the jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible, so the movie ain´t as bad as people are painting it. it has some quality, and i liked to watch it. in fact, i loved the film. and i didn´t need to turn off my brains to watch it. i wasn´t always thinking "is this possible?" or tramp like that. 9 in 10.

i saw once no man's land (1987) - imdb link http://us.imdb.com/title?0093638 - and found it ok. the film is about a guy who steals only porsches. gone in sixty seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it. in fact, it has a lot of scenes that are worthless. and the ending is very, very bad.the sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used...

i really loved this film, yes, i know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together. cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy, he was a little "too" much don't you think? anyway, great film, great cars and great acting. i for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night. :)

i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night. i didn't really hear much about it. so i wasn't expecting anything. but after i saw it, i really liked it. nicolas cage and the rest of the cast were very good. but i do have to say giovanni ribisi's acting performace did need a little perking up. but such a small flaw, it could be overrided. gone in 60 seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. the movie is in no way predictable. so the ending should be a suprise. think it's just another, fast car driving movie? well you are partially right. there is much more to it. everyone should take a look at this movie.

the story is quite original, but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars. its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too, but the actual stealing should've been more in picture... however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see (7/10)

weak, fast and multicolor,this is the valvoline's movie in fact you can see always this brand of oil in a lot of scene. the real protagonist are the cars,weak performances of cage and duvall. a intresting angelina jolie is a unlikely mechanic. for the lovers of dream car(lamborghini and ferrari over all).

good action and interesting plot. having seen the original i must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie. good cast .. meaningful acting.. although it would nice to see some more expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story. fun movie to watch and keeps you alert all the time 7/10 is a right vote i think!

i saw this on a flight over to the u.s and was a little sceptical at first as a few people had said there were so many characters in it that you didnt get to know any of them. however i didnt find this at all. the film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. the chase scenes are excellent and yes it may be predictable but isnt that true of most films. the main villain is a bit of a let down, christopher eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but that said its still a good film.

it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old, fast, or exotic cars. it has a plot and a lot of action. the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene. all of the other scenes are great. i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well.

if you like cars you will love this film!there are some superb actors in the film, especially vinnie jones, with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance.the others are not bad either....there are only two slight flaws to this film. firstly, the poor plot, however people don't watch this film for the plot. secondly, the glorification of grand theft auto (car crime). however if people really believe they can steal a ferrari and get away with it then good look to them, hope you have a good time in jail!when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role, i first thought "...sweeet.", but then i thought "...naaaa you suck!" but then finally after watching the film i realised "...yep he suck's!".only joking he plays the role very well.i'll end this unusual review by saying "if the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death carries with it an inherent nobility. and a supreme glory. we should all be so fortunate. you can say "poor criminal." i say: "poor us."p.s. - angelina jolie voight looks quite nice!

i have had the chance to watch several movies in bluray and hd dvd. this movie stays to it's wonderful action and great story. although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it. not having this movie on dvd helped make the purchase easier. i have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don't always go together. overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch. now on the blu ray scale. in many blu ray movies you either get two things. a picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture. i was disappointed when i made this my first blu ray movie. i almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard. although after watching other movies i know better. i don't believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd. that is generally the problem with some movies. and for the price of blu ray players and the blue ray discs you should only have the best picture. so i only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version.

nick cage is randall raines, a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he's forced to save his the life of his brother kip (giovanni ribisi) when he screws up on a job, by completing his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night. he has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch. but the cops are onto him, so can he pull it off? this was one of the great candidates of a film to re-make as the original was far from a classic. and if you don't go into it expecting much, and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is. you'll end up enjoying the ride. watch it on a double-bill with "the fast and the furious" for a night of high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards.my grade: b- dvd extras: 7 minute jerry bruckheimer interview; bruckheimer bio/filmography; action overload: highlight reel; the big chase; "0 to 60" featurette; "wild rides" featurette; stars on the move; the cult "painted on the heart" music video; theatrical trailer, and trailers for "shanghai noon", "mission to mars" and "coyote ugly"

as much as i like big epic pictures - i'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces. films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. there are hundreds of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones.it's an update of the movie that shares its name. it also shares that picture's ethos, but not quite it's execution. whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget. often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug-ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, sixty succeeds.the plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write imdb about. often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will voice it with different inflections. a lot of people found this annoying; i find it raises a smile. each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here, with cage, jolie and duvall leading the pack of course (and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here). the chemistry between good ol' saint nick the stalwart (see date of review) and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments.the villain is not even a little scary - i've seen chris eccleston play tough-guy roles before so i know he can handle them, but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action. we know the heroes are going to succeed, somehow; we're just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in-cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating. in fact, i wouldn't have minded some fourth-wall breaking winks at the camera: it's just that kind of movie.all this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed *just* so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. and for the most part, it is. wonderfully so. i've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast-cut extreme close-up shots to direct action these days. i personally find this kind of thing exhausting. i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time. i've been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance (in real life i mean - his character clearly doesn't care) and it shows. the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow-burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and fun - way possible.so yes, this movie isn't an "epic, life-affirming post-9/11 picture with obligatory social commentary" effort. the pacing is uneven, some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. but car movies rarely come better than this. so if you hate cars... why are you even reading these comments?!i'd take it over the numerous iterations of "the flaccid and the tedious" (guess the franchise) any day. 7/10

to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip (giovanni ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total). he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order'. the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of randall (nicolas cage), a retired' booster and also kip's brother and a couple of old friends of randall's. as you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was. of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story. you are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the hot stuff, since there are only 50 beautiful, fast, cool and expensive cars to be stolen. well the other hot item in this film is sway (angelina jolie (who will be a big star (trust me))). she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft, but she is pretty hot too. ok not hot as in pretty, but hot as in damn cool and sexy. she was very believable in this role, probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too (don't believe me, read her biography) and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man. i only know, that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film, because she is not too mainstream, a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo.ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes. hey but after seeing the whole film i must say: who cares. why must i say that, well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars; one cool, wild, sexy lady (yes, i mean mrs. jolie) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  feelgood ending.as for nicolas cage, well he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock, con air, face / off, snake eyes and finally this one. plus what actor has had so many good action / thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? well no one!!! maybe jackie chan, but he is one of my favourites too. one thing that is true though about mr. cages bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. the rock, was a clear 9, con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. not that that mark is bad. does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? no it doesn't show us that, because almost all of cage's films were successful in the last few years, except for 8mm and bringing out the dead. 8mm was not great, i admit that, but that was never cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. about the latter film i can not say anything, cause i have not seen it yet. one thing though i know for sure, if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, i would have said yes to all of them. i would have said yes to the rock, because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris. i would have said yes to con air, because there would be a lot of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with john malkovich and ving rhames. in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big paycheque, i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie (can't wait to see her in that lara croft outfit). this one was a good choice of mr. cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10

what's in a name? if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action.in producer bruckheimer's latest film, gone in 60 seconds, its all about the nomenclature. with character monikers like kip, sway and the sphinx and cars idealized with names like diane, sue and the elusive eleanor, it's only the non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game.not a deep script by any means, but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as memphis raines, along with angelina jolie and robert duvall, comes out of car-thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. a remake of the 1974 cult hit, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining.surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting. although loaded with stars, none of them have standout performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers, giovanni ribisi. even jolie, coming off her recent oscar win, is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film? i think so. the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling. just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre.3 1/2 out of 5

gone in 60 sec. where do i began, it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars. people say its not a good movie i disagree sure it has some cheesy parts but what action movie doesn't. i gave it an 8 out of 10 cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the rock or face off than this movie is right up your alley cage dose a good job along with one of the most under rated actors in my mind del-roy lindo. i think sometimes people look to far into movies some times you need to sit back enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself did they achieve what they where showing. meaning if they where going for action was it action pact. if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they? i think they made the action movie they set out to make, give it a chance and you wont be sorry.

gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over $100 million but got blasted by most critics. i personally thought this was a great film. the story was believable and has probobly the greatest cast ever for this type of movie including 3 academy award winners nicolas cage, robert duvall and the very hot anjolina jolie. other than the lame stunt at the end this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (out of ****)

gone in 60 seconds / (2000) *** (out of four)	"gone in 60 seconds" is an energetic, slick, stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles. if you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer jerry bruckheimer ("con air," "the rock"), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride.	the film stars giovanni ribisi ("the mod squad") as a young crook named kip raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal raymond calitri (christopher eccleston). when kip's life is threatened because of such, his older brother, randall "memphis" raines (nicolas cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days.	memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. the crew includes sara "sway" wayland (angelina jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing memphis through previous business, a fellow named mirror man (t.j. cross), the aging and wise otto halliwell (robert duvall), as well as tumbler (scott caan), atley jackson (will patton), toby (william lee scott), and donny astricky (chi mcbrde). 	contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, roland castlebeck (delroy lindo) and drycoff (timothy olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.there is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. to make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. i am not stating i think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish; i actually honor the director's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an r-rating. however, i do believe in a movie such as "gone in 60 seconds," to strongly develop the character's enlightenment, dialogue needs to be believable and authentic.  in spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, perfectly cast performers responsible. nicolas cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. angelina jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. delroy lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. giovanni ribisi, scott caan, robert duvall, will patton, and christopher eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles.	the film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. in the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. while the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot, not a whole lot happens. the third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.	the soundtrack to "gone in 60 seconds" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. it is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. dominic sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in "gone in 60 seconds" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitementbut not much more.  

this movie has taken a lot of stick. it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cage's career. the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "bruck-buster" action at its best. fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. it has everything: ferraris, mercs, a hummer and lets not forget eleanor! i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! then again maybe that's just me!

to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didn't go into theaters,the deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used,there are a few dull moments when the story's following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday get's the props it should.the very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer,the property he buy's turns out to be where the witch(tooth fairy)lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger don't wanna give anything really away just a little info if you've wanted to see this movie then do so it's worth the price of the rental

i thought the children in the show did a very good job. i especially enjoyed the performance of the emma character. well done! the stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. i was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes.i enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her. the ghostly apparitions of the children's souls being released was also good. another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along. there wasn't a lot of slow scenes. the adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining. all in all an enjoyable night of movie watching.

i almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked. the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station.they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy. it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be. the make-up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one. it was a simple story with believable acting.it's not the scariest or goriest movie, but i wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it. on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out.

after viewing several episodes of this series, i have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still they can only -almost - make it work.the dialog is good! the male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions. most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side-kick. and most of the episode plots come across as palatable. so what could be wrong? how about the, the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them. the producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series, in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader. why, i ask, why?the episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen. these actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles, and you don't actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments. a blind person could tell. just listen to them talk. they deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom. who would believe these women are phd scientist, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors?in a nut shell, if the producers have their choice of a stockard channing or a morgan fairchild, guess who they'll choose - every time? and of course, the series suffers for it. too bad!

i loved this show from it's first airing, and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week. the plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding! then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining, well written show. i say bring it back, i know all of the actors would come back. i would suggest buying the dvd's, i am. i hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. i only watch one show on that channel now, (ghost hunters), but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too.

intelligent, wry, and thrilling, "the invisible man" stood out in 2000 among sci-fi's usual lineup, balancing out "farscape"'s fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty, cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. the show sat between "law and order" and "doctor who" on the believability meter, but there was no denying the fact that "i-man"'s characters went beyond caricature. even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper, the official, and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. paul ben-victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly, made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. the show's low points are still entertaining, and i've never seen such taut pilot episodes. matt greenberg and sci-fi should be commended, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show. every time i come across a marathon of "hercules: the legendary journeys" on sci-fi, i roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that "invisible man" and its ilk represented.

the invisible man is a show everybody s gotta love! it reminds me of the old school 80's series(a-team,airwolf,knightrider) the special effects are small but very effective!! but what is most important is the fun they had shooting this series. it really shows! the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want!! especially paul ben victor and vincent ventresca. ventresca really shines in this one! for me its unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style doesn't get a shot in a big movie (mr tarantino this was the show you should have directed! instead of that major boring grave danger(c.s.i)) get this show if you can. well worth it!!!

when i heard that this movie was coming out the night before halloween, i was very excited. when i found out that it was a book, written in 1978, i had to read it before seeing the movie. i'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book. the writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book, with minor differences, naturally. i think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was boyle playing the role of col. i'm not a big fan of boyle, and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie, she's always trying to use her over-plumped lips, and darkly makeup-ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy. indeed, i think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house. my favorite subplot was the sheehan family (which is so weird b/c the son was killed in iraq and in current events there is casey sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti-iraq tirade). in the book, obviously the war was not iraq, but rather, vietnam, and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter, i was truly creeped out. overall, i was impressed with the movie, in that it followed the book very well.

after too many years of waiting, anne rivers siddons' noted 1979 book "the house next door" has finally been filmed. the result veers a bit from the novel which, especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a tv film, the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good, just not as great as the book, one of stephen king's favorites and one of mine as well.with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release, all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured, especially the climactic revelation near the very end.still, the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence. there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed. actually, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next-door amateur-artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas.be sure to read the great novel.

an ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. or at least that is what lara flynn boyle's character, col kennedy, argues. after a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door, col knows something has got to give. mark-paul gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect.my opinion: the house next door works because of lara flynn boyle and the locations (beautiful house) and stylish sets. boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely stunning. she brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. without her, it would have failed. "it's so alive" declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house. yes, it is alive. but the story itself is not so much.barring boyle's presence, not much is happening here, as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. the results are predictable. but i liked it anyway. the cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on account of boyle, the premise of an evil ultra-modern house, the locations and cinematography, and set decoration and wardrobe.

unlike another user who said this movie sucked (and that olivia hussey was terrible), i disagree.this movie was amazing!!!!!! olivia hussey is awesome in everything she's in! yeah she may be older now, because many remember her from romeo and juliet, but she's wonderful! this story line may be used quite often, but it's a unique movie and i'll fight back on anyone who disagrees! i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie. olivia's "my girl" and i love her work.i saw this for the first time on saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. not only because's it's an olivia movie, but because of it's unique story line and wonderful direction.

i like ghost stories. good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. now i've see many of them. as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films, some times to find a real gem , you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. now this one, very rare , pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called " the new house " was one of the most scariest films i ever saw. it was on once in 1972,...i was only 9,..but nothing since then even compared to it. with all the remake going on in hollywood, some one should do this one " as is " with no more special efx than the original. this episode was down right creepy as hell. i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find. the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original " the haunting " and george c. scott in " the changling " . wish someone would do more ghost stories like these.

typical de palma movie made with lot's of style and some scene's that will bring you to the edge of your seat.most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller, is the style. it has some brilliantly edited scene's and some scene's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat. the best scene's from the movie; the museum scene and the elevator murder. there are some mild erotic scene's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. so this movie might not be suitable for everybody.the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work! it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie.there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast. michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking (not bad for a 49-year old!).the musical score by pino donaggio is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well, just like his score for the other de palma movie, "body double".brilliant nerve wrecking thriller. i love de palma!10/10

*** out of ****yep! dressed to kill is that kind of a movie. it's like kalifornia, but it's different. remember? that movie from 1993 which stars brad pitt as a serial killer who is "welcomed" by a couple of travelers in a trip to california as a buddy who might be a good company along the way. when i watch a movie, i always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler. that's how it was with kalifornia. when i watched it last year for the first time, i never realized it was a suspense movie, so when i found out, i was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and i was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close i was to it! so, we're discussing about dressed to kill, right? before i watched this movie (today!), i've only watched 2 others movies from brian de palma, so i can say i don't really know that well his works, but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be. carrie (1976) and mission:impossible (1996). when i watched carrie on the tv, i was really that desperate to get a dvd copy and i can tell: this movie is great! mission:impossible also. and today, i watched a third movie from depalma. well, dressed to kill is a movie like kalifornia. when the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect. i was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room. you may guess what may have happened there. but when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path. i was watching the rest of the movie, and i really liked it. however, there are some low points... some characters in the movie are completely silent! take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene. i was always hoping that he could say something but he never did! this was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece. even in the cab scene, where dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other. you know, it reminded me of the mexican tv series of the 70's "el chavo del 8", where some characters are completely silent. getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot. dennis franz is cool as detective marino! reminded me of him as capt. carmine lorenzo in die hard 2 (1990) where he plays almost the same kind of character. well, concluding this review, the ending of dressed to kill is the same ending as it is in carrie! i don't know if i really liked that, because i hate imitations! i understand that carrie is a movie from depalma, so it's not actually an imitation, because after all it was his idea! but it turned to be a repetitive idea in dressed to kill, so depalma could have done something different instead of showing nancy allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to amy irving at the ending scene of carrie. this was, of course, with no doubt, another low point. but if you get past this, you will find that dressed to kill is a really good movie, and i assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it.

in what must be one of the most blood-freezing movies ever, a transvestite is murdering people in new york, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. one can see how brian depalma takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff. michael caine plays a most thought-provoking character, while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo. keith gordon (who later starred in "christine") is probably the most interesting character in the movie. but you can't really understand this movie without seeing it. and after seeing it, you may never know just whom you can trust. also starring nancy allen and dennis franz.

i grew up watching this series. i was about seven/eight years old when it was on. i still remember the 1st episode which was called "the new house." it scared the h*ll out of me! i can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly. and the ending, oh my god! the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: yikes! this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series. i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. my question to any readers: has anyone purchased this set? its a bootleg. both sellers claim to have very good copy. i have a sketchy and poor dvd of "the new house" episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids. a great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural. thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- in fact, i'd love to discuss it. chris walker

the fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem. this movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. the museum scene is like a nice music video. the apres sex scene is an all too familiar scene in all of our adult lives. but the movie would not hold any interest for me without keith gordon. keith gordon is maybe one of the most underrated actors of our time. almost everything i know about acting came from studying mostly his eyes. he had the most compelling face. his character possesses the qualities i look in a guy, sensitivity and dedication. keith gordon is gorgeous. btw, i kinda wish he'd shave his beard now as his lips, jawline and adam's apple were his prettiest set next to his eyes.

this is probably one of brian de palma's best known movies but it isn't his best. body double, the fury and carrie are better movies but this movie is better than blow out and obsession. de palma is very influenced by hitchcock and this movie is a take off on psycho. angie dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist, played by michael caine, turns down an offer, dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him. after this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and nancy allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer. dennis franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust allen and she has to find the killer herself. it's a pretty good movie but isn't one of de palma's best.

brian de palma's undeniable virtuosity can't really camouflage the fact that his plot here is a thinly disguised "psycho" carbon copy, but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax. his "blow out", made the next year, was an improvement.

writer-director brian de palma is best known for his string of films that have been called, somewhat unfairly, "hitchcock imitations." contrary to popular belief, de palma doesn't rip-off hitchcock; he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a hitchcock film and then expands on them in a more violent, modern way. like hitchcock, de palma is known for mixing blood-soaked death with macabre humor."dressed to kill," made way back in 1980, is, perhaps, de palma's most well-known hitchcockian film, and it's probably his best as well. the story involves a cross-dressing serial killer stalking both a burnt-out housewife (played by angie dickinson) and a street-wise hooker (played by nancy allen).yes, it will remind you distinctly of "psycho," but de palma's flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative. the museum sequence is particularly well-scored and edited; the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film. "dressed to kill" may not be a complete original, but i'd say it's definitely worth your time. rated r. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.

"dressed to kill" is brian depalma's best film, an absolute thrill ride of suspense, humor and style that remains unrivaled today. depalma has a bum rap in hollywood, as most people claim that he rips off alfred hitchcock. he does not. hitchcock could only dream of what depalma shows in his thrillers.sadly, the original uncut version of "dressed to kill" is no longer available on video. the current copy released by goodtimes is the jack valenti approved r rated cut. but some copies of depalma's original cut still exist. it is the one distributed by warner home video, in both a green cardboard box with angie dickinson on the cover, or in a black clamshell case with the theatrical poster on silver lining. these are the ones to get, if you can find a copy. i have the green one and it is among my treasured possessions.anyway, back to the story. dickinson plays kate miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is being treated by dr. robert elliott ( michael caine) for her obsessive fantasies. while on a trip to the museum (a real tour-de-force for depalma in terms of camera work and suspense), miller is picked up by a stranger. you can pretty much guess what happens to her, since the ads and box art give away the story. but there are a few complications. a hooker (nancy allen) is the sole witness to the murder. kate miller's son peter (keith gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. and dr. elliott's answering machine has a certain message on it...about a missing razor...i'm not spoiling the film at all for you since what i have described above takes place within the opening half hour and depalma's biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour. this film is explicit, however, enough for valenti (head of the mpaa) to demand cuts in the film. what surprises me is what cuts he wanted. several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two slashing scenes and some of nancy allen's dialogue (valenti wanted "cock" changed to "bulge"). this is a film that is very violent and bloody, yet the objections are to sexual content. i'd love to hear valenti's explaination at how seeing two women in a tender love scene in "lost and delirious" is somehow more damaging to a young mind than arnold schwarzenegger blowing away people with a chain gun. it just isn't fair.what makes "dressed to kill" so good is that not only are the technical credits first rate, but the performances are very good as well. michael caine, who was in a lot of crap in this time period, gives one of his best performances as the doctor. angie dickinson is better than usual, possibly because she actually has a strong role here. nancy allen adds this to her range of performances that has her pegged as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world. keith gordon is wonderful as the genius and i loved all those inventions of his.depalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved. the recent joke of the afi 100 best thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is. if they were to actually open their eyes for once, they would see that depalma has staked his career in thrillers and is actually the best craftsman. this is even better than "psycho". it's a shame that very few actually know that.**** out of 4 stars

"dressed to kill" is surely one of the best horror/thriller movies ever made.it's taut,stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence.the acting is pretty good,the orchestral score by pino donaggio is unforgettable and there's plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans intrigued."dressed to kill" is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated housewife(angie dickinson),her teenage son(keith gordon),her psychoanalyst(michael caine),and a high price call girl(nancy allen).the murderer in the film is a transsexual named bobbi who is also one of caine's patients.the film is full of breathtaking moments:the infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well.highly recommended.

the film gets my stamp of approval. the scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue. this is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film. dickinson's character kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film. the best work angie dickinson did since point blank!

i just finished watching dressed to kill,which is written and directed by brian de palma.the dvd had both the"r" rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the "r" rated version,i can't be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend you,i would suggest you view the "r" rated version.but i digress.any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery/ psychological horror/suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself,to give the scene a low budget feel.most of the violence,or rather possibility of such,is implied.the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose,which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films. anyway,i also thought the acting was good,especially angie dickinson.and micheal cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role,which works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in it,in my mind,although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint(and it's really more of an observation)i have is that i thought the character played by nancy allen could have been fleshed out more,especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to it,which is even more relevant today.but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it.i also really liked the musical score,composed by pino dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original psycho.to me,this music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for me,dressed to kill(1980)is 10/10

a very silly movie, this starts with a soft porn sequence, ventures into farcelike comedy in the art gallery, adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason.what follows is bizarre and surreal (the stopwatch scene in particular is exquisitely unnecessary), culminating in a revelatory "twist" ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer (see the trivia section for precisely why it's deliberately unfair).the movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals, the insane, and the wonderful "huggie bear"-style racial stereotyping on the subway - and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes, as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film. though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch.in fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: despite its many, many flaws, the whole package just, well, works.

may contain minor spoilers.dressed to kill, having just seen it for the first time the other day, is a movie with some terrific sequences, some decent performances, and a nice, though obvious hitchcock ripoff, plot twist at the end. it's just too bad certain things, quite obvious, prevent it from being a classic.dressed to kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has slain at least two women (could have been more but the movie never tells us), and the search for the killer by three people: a brainy kid whose mom was a victim, a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer, and a psychiatrist whose patient was the slained brainy kid's mother. there are a host of well done performances including nancy allen as the hooker liz, angie dickenson as the sexually frustrated victim kate miller, and micheal caine as doctor rober elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye; though by no standard is anyone really outstanding. on the other hand denis franz, later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show nypd blue, is embarrassing as an over-exaggerated, ruthless, hateful detective, though he takes little screen time so it doesn't hurt the movie that much. keith gordon, the brain child, is decent, but is almost too smart to really be believable.what sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences. the scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done, as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death. i also love the sequence at the doctor's office, that reveals the identity of the killer, which really makes the whole film come together at once. and there's a split screen scene that i thought was almost classic. still there's another situation when liz is on a train, running from what may be the killer, that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes. as a thriller it's tense and quite often believable. as a crime drama it often falters, especially with the incomplete, ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end. there's also a needless, and way too long, dream sequence at the end, in which they had the audacity to shoot someone's foot for what seemed minutes at a time. this was an up and down experience; one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with enticement, and the next would make me squirm and ask why. at more than 100 minutes this could have been under 90 and been a better film.scary movie fans should like this. it still stands as a better film than most of today's slasher flicks. maybe it was a better film in it's time, but having just seen it recently i can say i enjoy it, and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone.

ghost story,(the new house) is a terrific horror story. this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventies.the beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot. remember him from the early family series, family affair in the 1960s? this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors, and as the main characters in the story.i saw this recently,and i was so scared!if you are alone,i would not recommend that you watch this.this story is terrific,no gore or curse words, but very scary. barbara parkins played the young bride. david birney played her husband.both actors were very good in their parts.if you like scary, fun,terrifying ghost stories, then you will like this little gem. i gave this a high rating.i highly recommend this story.

dressed to kill starts off with kate miller (angie dickinson) having a sexually explicit nightmare, later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr. robert elliott (michael caine) for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated & unfulfilled in her current marriage. kate then visits a museum & picks up a stranger, they go back to his apartment for casual sex, when done kate is set to leave but is attacked & killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman. prostitute liz blake (nancy allen) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape. detective marino (dennis franz) says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate's son peter (keith gordon) to track down the real killer, clear liz's name & see that justice is done...written & directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery. the script is measured & slow at times but it likes to focus on the character's so you really know them, the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off, then the film switches it's attentions to liz & no one else gets a look in. this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing & engaging, unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable. i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times, especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally. the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill. it's a good film but it didn't excite me that much & i didn't really find any character to root for or like. the film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that i didn't really see the point of.director de palma directs with style & visual flair, from the art museum sequence to a car chase & as a whole it's impeccably filmed throughout. i'd imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it. i felt the film was a bit flat & uninspired at times though, nothing about it really excited me that much. there is a fair bit of nudity, some sex & rape along with a few bits of gore & violence, kate's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight, if that's the right word. however, it's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe.with a supposed budget of about $6,500,000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film. the new york locations are nice, the cinematography is good & as a whole it's extremely well made. i thought the music was inappropriate & was far to loud & intrusive. the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn't think caine had that much screen time. allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made, interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them, this & blow out (1981), he cast her as a prostitute... a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start.dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn't think it quite lived up to it's lofty reputation. good but not brilliant.

de palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques, though unfortunately, as with many of the films written by de palma himself, the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale. the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband. she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously near-and the whole thing is revealed to be angie's fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed. she has a short scene with her son, a dead ringer for harry potter, which concludes with a joke that "she'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter." she then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, michael caine. he refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled.then begins a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film. among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling stories and in typical de palma fashion, he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill. the problem, for me, is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill. the sequence begins with angie at an art museum. she watches strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her. de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about angie's attraction, embarrassment, retreating, and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab, all set to a wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio, who also scored carrie.in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy, and gets up to return to her husband. again de palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered, as angie realizes that she doesn't have her panties, that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease, and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. it's all very admirable, but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor, then up again, almost in real time....spoilers from here on out! when angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair. the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there. there is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator, angie reaches up toward her, and the killer's blade is held poised to slash nancy's hands. then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror. it's all good, and by the time we have some dialogue again, you think; "woah, that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative!" or maybe you don't, but i do.a younger dennis franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him. he interviews michael caine, making the outrageous implication (though it passes as commonplace) that angie wanted to be killed. angie's son is there as well, and he hooks up with nancy, and they set about to spy on caine's therapist and find out who the killer is.once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film, in this case psycho (just as obsession is a re-working of vertigo). you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut, who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing. it is very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around, and that is my primary reservation about this film. it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma's greatest setpieces, but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole-hearted affection.--- check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, cinema de merde, cinemademerde.com

dressed to kill understandably made a bit of a ruckus when first released in 1980: you had "police girl" in a role that was mega-erotic, as angie dicknson played a sexually frustrated housewife looking for good times in all the wrong museums (and there into apartment elevators), plus nancy allen as a call-girl, michael caine as norman bates's sophisticated new york cousin, and enough lurid imagery to last two movies of the period. today it's slightly less incriminating by standards and such, though the unrated version has some of the most "hot" content of any of de palma's films, at least in his quasi-auteur period of the 70s and early 80s, where he seemed to repeat themes over and over, ideas taken right off the film-reels of hitchcock classics and given a tawdry uplift. it's a simple tale that one partly already saw in sisters, and then again to an extent in body double, and also in blow out. cutie allen plays call-girl liz blake, who has to clear her name of suspicion of killing kate (dickinson, in full blown 'milf' mode), after being found with a razor, the murder weapon from dr. elliott's office (michael caine, stone-cold performance most of the way).from the start, which de palma seems to do as a way of setting up a dangerous sexual fantasy scene as a way of topping the opening scene of carrie (which, perhaps, he does just in editing terms), we get a series of technical knock-out turns through the point of view of style itself: the tracking shots in the museum, meant to stir up more of a fascination with the process itself, of following and wanting to be followed, than any kind of tension; the chase through the subway (a precursor to carlito's way) is done with a precise level of suspense, meanwhile, with a slightly exploitation bit thrown in with the black gang; the character of peter, kate's son (keith gordon), who plays what is essentially a younger version of the real life de palma as a kid (science geek, obsessed with hitchcock and voyeurism). and it's all entertaining and entrancing as hell as something that comes close to a real synthesis of what makes de palma's thrillers so unique while being so self-consciously untainted by a fearless attitude of film-making.on the other hand, that same self-consciousness ended up coming back to bite the director in the butt a few times in recent years, and somehow in dressed to kill it starts to become very erratic and disappointing as the story has to wrap itself up. as the psycho themes come together even more apparently (man who wants a sex-change, doesn't even think he's killing as it is *she* who is doing it), there is an expository scene in the police station that makes the aforementioned hitch film look like an astonishing psychological revelation. and the final scenes at peter's house, also calling painfully into recollection a much more accomplished sequence in carrie, are meant for a manipulation that even for de palma is asking for it; the final shot especially, albeit a master's class in how to copy yourself. yet there is a very deranged and, within itself, perfect scene at the mental hospital amid this confused denouement, where the doctor does some work on a nurse, to which all the other inmates act like animals in a zoo, and an over-head shot going up and up over the scene is one of the best shots of sexual/general perversion ever captured on film.a shame then that the film ends on such a strange and unsettling manner, where up until then it is a remarkable piece of pulp cinema, where class is all around in the technical aspects (soft lighting, intricate camera movements seemingly so simple) amid subject matter that should be found in the mix of paperbacks for 25 cents. it's no masterpiece, but i'd certainly take it over most of the director's recent thrillers any day.

dressed to kill (1980) is a mystery horror film from brian de palma and it really works.the atmosphere is right there.the atmosphere that makes you scared.and isn't that what a horror film is supposed to do.all the actors are in the right places.michael caine is perfect as dr. robert elliott, the shrink with a little secret.angie dickinson as kate miller, the sexually frustrated mature woman is terrific.keith gordon as her son peter is brilliant.nancy allen as liz blake the call girl is fantastic.dennis franz does his typical detective role.his detective marino is one of the most colorful in this movie.there are plenty of creepy scenes in this movie.the elevator scene is one of them.there have been made comparisons between this and alfred hitchcock's psycho (1960).there are some similarities between these two movies.both of these movies may cause some sleepless nights.

intelligent, stylish, and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films!when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer.dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason. de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense. the finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish'.it's a truly edge of your seat shocker. even more impressive though is de palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. dressed to kill is also a very erotic film, but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film.the cast is another strong feature of this film. michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. nancy allen's performance as an involved street-walker is solid. a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son.many criticize de palma's films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality, as calling this film a 'rip-off' would be degrading to a fine thriller. dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans.**** out of ****

"dressed to kill" has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years, but it is a true american classic, a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller.i sincerely hope the dvd release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it.

"dressed to kill", is one of the best thrillers ever made. its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults. brian de palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. he directs many scenes without dialog, and he tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his visuals, and pino donnagio's brilliant score. filmed in panavision, the film must be seen in widescreen, as de palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story. cropped, on video, "dressed to kill", is barely the same movie. solid performances from its cast, superb direction, and, perhaps, the finest film score ever written, make "dressed to kill" a must see.

in france, it's considered polite from french critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him. however, a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects "carrie" (1976), "the fury" (1978) "scarface" (1983) without mentioning his borrowings from hitchcock. here, in "dressed to kill", it's impossible not to think of "vertigo" (1958) for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in "psycho" (1960). about our involved film, i don't want to revive the old debate: does de palma rip off hitchcock? instead, i would tend to be generous and to classify "dressed to kill" in the category of de palma's winners alongside "sisters" (1973) and "obssession" (1976). with however some reservations and they're the ones i previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between de palma's rabid fans and his detractors.if there's one sure thing in "dressed to kill" which can generate general agreement among film-lovers, it's de palma's virtuosity in directing. he wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do. his sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura. the audience is easily glued in front of the screen. this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures. by the way, in "psycho", there were also long silent, suspenseful parts...but the main drawback in de palma's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot can't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic, corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories. the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime. then, she's suspected by the police and has to act on her own (with a little help from the victim's son from the scene in the subway onwards)) to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence. apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once isn't demeaned at all, it's a menu which smells the reheated. and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one. yes, it's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function, one figures: "it's almost gratuitous filler". perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows (and even before) who the killer is.the two central mainsprings in de palma's set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism. the latter theme is well present in "dressed to kill" from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie. and the filmmaker isn't afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear. i find his approach about this theme rather doubtful. but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side.i don't want to demean at all de palma's work. his prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects. twenty six years after, the controversy he aroused amid movie-goers isn't ready to subside.

kate miller (angie dickinson) is having problems in her marriage and otherwise--enough to see a psychologist. when her promiscuity gets her into trouble, it also involves a bystander, liz blake (nancy allen), who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer.dressed to kill is somewhat important historically. it is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through hide and seek (2005). it's odd then that director brian de palma was basically trying to crib hitchcock. for example, de palma literally lifts parts of vertigo (1958) for dressed to kill's infamous museum scene. dressed to kill's shower scenes, as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to psycho (1960). de palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of hitchcock's favorite composer bernard herrmann. the similarities do not end there.but de palma, whether by accident or skill, manages to make an oblique turn from, or perhaps transcend, his influence, with dressed to kill having an attitude, structure and flow that has been influential. maybe partially because of this influence, dressed to kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time. countless subsequent directors have taken their hitchcock-like de palma and honed it, improving nearly every element, so that watched now, after 25 years' worth of influenced thrillers, much of dressed to kill seems agonizingly paced, structurally clunky and plot-wise inept.one aspect of the film that unfortunately hasn't been improved is dressed to kill's sex and nudity scenes. both dickinson and allen treat us to full frontal nudity (allen's being from a very skewed angle), and de palma has lingering shots of dickinson's breasts, strongly implicit masturbation, and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films. quite a few scenes approach soft-core porn. i'm no fan of prudishness--quite the opposite. our culture's puritanical, monogamistic, sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me. so from my perspective, it's lamentable that dressed to kill's emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film. perhaps it has been desired, but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts.de palma's direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than de palma does it. he has an odd, characteristic approach to close-ups, and he's fond of shots from interesting angles, such as overhead views and james whale-like tracking across distant cutaways in the sets. of course later directors have been flashier, but it's difficult to say that they've been better. viewed for film-making prowess, at least, the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance or two while following kate through the intricately nested cubes of the metropolitan museum of art.on the other hand, from a point of view caring about the story, and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller, everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly. because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache (as well as cultural facts external to the film), the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risqué. once the first murder occurs, things improve, but because of the film's eventual influence, much of the improvement now seems a bit clichéd and occasionally hokey.the performances are mostly good, although michael caine is underused, and dickinson has to exit sooner than we'd like (but the exit is necessary and very effective). dressed to kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end, but because of facts not contained in the picture itself, hasn't exactly aged well. at this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an example--but not the best, even for that era--of some of de palma's directorial flair.

ghost story (the tv movie--1972) was the pilot for the nbc series. the movie was well-written and well-acted and, i thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, if the tv series is half as good as the movie, then nbc has a winner. (i wish this film was available on video!!) the series was a colossal disappointment--even with william castle as exec. producer. if, however,you have a chance to see the original tv movie, ghost story, check it out. you won't be disappointed.

psychotic transsexual bobbi murders the patient (angie dickinson) of a prominent doctor (michael caine) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute (nancy allen) who caught a glimpse of bobbi in the elevator. liz (allen) comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient's son (keith gordon) to catch the killer.it can be summed up in a couple of words: it's very sexy (dickinson and allen look great), it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies, and boy is it well crafted. writer / director de palma's script is ok but it really takes a backseat to the man's film-making abilities. it is highly successful on a visceral level and i actually get involved / interested with these characters. i can notice the standard de palma homages to / ripoffs of hitchcock - at least from one of the master's pictures.and to top it all off, it has a professional and believable cast.this was de palma's third movie with ex-wife nancy allen (after "carrie" and "home movies".)by the way, dancer-turned-actress rachel ticotin was one of the production assistants. there's a bit of trivia for you.i wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off.one of the best things about it is a typically striking pino donaggio music score.8/10

when you compare what brian de palma was doing in the 80's to what passes for entertainment today, his films keep looking better and better. "dressed to kill, "blow out", "body double", "scarface" and "carlito's way" are all superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his powers. the guy had a long run of better than average films. this is pure hitchcock with an 80's dash of lurid perversion, an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists, huge helpings of style, a stunning pino donaggio score, and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot. de palma's love of complex camera-work and luscious, blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of dennis franz, keith gordon (a good director in his own right), nancy allen (de palma's wife at the time) and michael caine make every scene special. let the virtuoso take you on a surreal, scary, erotically charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every frame of "dressed to kill".

when people ask me why do i like movies so much, i usually respond, "have you seen the art-gallery sequence in de palma's dressed to kill?" that scene alone, pretty much represents everything i want to see in a film. if i was a film director, that would be the kind of thing i'd like to do. "pure cinema" is one way of describing that sequence, and it is truly amazing to see how director de palma's entire movie works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene. it is a dream-like movie, clever as hell, and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together. i think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion: could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? the film has no message to speak of, acting is great but it is at the service of the style, and the script is short on logic. de palma's movie makes a really good case that style, when handled properly, can sustain a feature length film. sure, michael caine, angie dickinson, nancy allen and keith gordon give superlative performances, but this is a director's movie all the way to the fadeout. it is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. i won't tell you what hitchcock movie the film pays homage to (i don't want to spoil any surprises), but i think de palma transcends the story's arc, and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career. not for the faint of heart!

a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation (many called it a "ripoff") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-tv tapes).the downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-nypd dennis franz (who has hair here!). the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies.there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder. the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women.

this is a very entertaining flick, considering the budget and its length. the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty. the acting was great (p'z to dom) and the cinematography was also very well done. i recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers, it will not disappoint you!

i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed. tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films. if she could do what she did with the budget of this film, i'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture. kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold), and to whoever composed the music. the warped "row your boat" blew me away. very creative film all around....i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i'd buy it in a second. if you get the chance, you should definitely see this film.

maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is, i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job. to do what she did with no budget...wow, thats all i can say. really, really good. like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away. i definitley suggest checking it out if you can. great directing, fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse. see it.

i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that stared dominic monaghan. i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his/her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep,it was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom.......i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere (well i've never seen it anywhere) you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance.

i'll come clean. the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. when i heard the title of the film, i thought it was going to be...different, perhaps in not such a good way.but i was wrong. after reading what few reviews were out there about this short, i was actually excited about seeing it. i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. needless to say, i was not disappointed.the film follows jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. i won't give away what happens, but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism.the directing is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.all in all, i give this great film 9 out of 10, for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve.

i first saw this movie at a festival. there were many good movies, but few kept me thinking about it long after, and an insomniac's nightmare was definitely one of them. tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker. the shots were great. casting was perfect. dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted. there wasn't a lot to know about his character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him. and ellen-- i can't wait to see where she ends up! she's showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films. with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, tess shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors. kudos to everyone involved with this film. and thanks to tess and co. for distributing it on dvd!

this is an almost action-less film following jack, an insomniac, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself off a building, and, for a lot of the time, can't tell reality from hallucination.dominic monaghan, as jack, is truly believable. confused, and scared but lethargic and, at times blankly accepting of what he sees, we follow him trying to sort out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep.introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children that suddenly appear in jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting, mind boggling, 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more.

an insomniac's nightmare is the story of a man's plunge into insanity. having chronic insomnia, jack is plagued by hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't.we find out interesting things about jack near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a "happily ever after" hollywood ending. wrong. this is new york city, the place where nobody sleeps.tess nanavati (writer and director) has herself a good film in 'an insomniac's nightmare'. a talented filmmaker and writer (she made this film right after her high school graduation), she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future.as i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable; between the music, bleak scenery, and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by dominic monaghan (as jack), i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it.

this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen. the writer/director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you. insomniac's nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen. is it a dream or reality? this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious. it has an eery feel with it's dark interpretations of illusions. dominic monaghan really became the insomniac. he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either! he really poured his whole being into this role. from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites. i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative, creative writer/director/cinematographer!!!

surprisingly well done for an independent film, an insomniac's nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. wonderfully well written, and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac.starring dominic monaghan as jack, we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on. the narration is almost hypnotizing, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to turn away. fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep, balancing on the brink between sanity and madness.with twists and turns around every corner, an insomniac's nightmare is provocative and engaging. it comes very highly recommended.

this is one of the first independent movies i've ever seen. for such a very low budget, it was done well; as an insomniac myself, i can sympathize with the main character, although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing. well directed, well acted, of a subject that i haven't seen much in theaters, lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting. there are few noticeable goofs, but they may be intended; you'll see after you watch the movie. the movie is very personal, and worth watching twice. no movie is flawless, but a hollywood version couldn't do the story better. all in all, 8/10.

i have seen this movie a while back, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big dominic monaghan fan. the movie itself was very interesting, though it had its positive points, which for me was the donnie darko kind of "wtf?" factor after the movie had ended.of course, with positive also come negative points. to me, the young girl in the film was incredibly good, and dominic monaghan did a good job as well. unfortunately i don't have this opinion about daniel burke, who played lonnie. this might just be me, and i'm not claiming to be a serious critic, in the way that i don't find myself skilled enough, but he just didn't seem convincing as an actor. but perhaps it's even more striking then, for although i am not a critic, this does get my attention.to conclude, over all i think it's definitely a film worth watching. it's interesting, confusing, and you just should have seen it.

i saw insomniac's nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say, i really found it to be quite good. if you are a fan of dominic monaghan you will love it. the hole movie takes place inside his mind -or does it? the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end. the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film, if not greater for those dom fans. it has tons of candid moments from the set, outtakes and a great interview with the director. anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess (the director), dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film. it was pretty enjoyable and i'm glad to have it in my collection.

an insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. i loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well. i was very impressed by the look of the film, too. usually, "independent films" have a grainy, i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this director knows what she's doing. the lighting, the cinematography...quality work. i'm looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati!

i didn't know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much. don't get my wrong its not a bad short film. tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film. you can tell that it has been an act of love for her. the acting (outside of dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good. there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on, though i don't feel it greatly detracts for one's ability to understand the film. if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do, i say go for it. the gag reel was fun, i won't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over. if you like the film then check out the pink mirror, a film also done by jagged edge. i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.

this film is one of the best shorts i've ever seen - and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals, i've seen a lot, especially of what the industry considers "the best." i'm not a fan of monaghan. his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me, his only decent performance being in lost, so i generally try to avoid his films. i did, however, happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed. this director really knows what she's doing. of course, you are going to get the trolls (or just ignorant people) who don't understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it. but luckily, from what i've seen, they are in the minority when it comes to this gem.let's not deny that the film was working on no budget, and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work, because that's certainly true. the production value is very low, but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school? pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't matter. if you take away a bit of the acting, the sound quality (which actually wasn't the fault of the filmmaker; i saw this at a festival and the sound was fine...i guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up), and the fact it was shot on mini-dv, then what are you left with? the story, the visual composition and the soul of the film, which are indisputably flawless.nanavati can tell a story. that much is clear. she can write substance-heavy, engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood, create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story, and bring it to life in a fascinating, creative way that, were this higher budget, might have won awards. give it more experienced actors, better sound post-production, and 35mm instead of mini-dv and even the trolls couldn't complain. this girl is incredible, and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago, she's done some amazing work since. the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that, and i can't wait to see the higher budget stuff she's done. 9/10 stars, this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker.

i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera. it's no epic but it's plenty engaging and i was never bored. if tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse, then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens. i know i'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release. damn good job, and well worth the money. what a script! it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures i've seen lately. nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. serious kudos to her, can't wait to see more.

cusack does his best david niven in this one, although i don't know if anyone besides me noticed it.when seen with this in mind, its a deliciously over saturated 'wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d*mn funny' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic.hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond. the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot - interesting choice.i never knew how soothing montel's voice was until this movie... i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs!

got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date, with an excellent performance for cusak, tomei, and all the supporting actors.excellent plot, very well-placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end. the action scenes were well filmed & choreographed. very funny.all in all i give this film a big thumbs up. it's extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle-east, and as such, it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour. indeed, at places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic.

this is a brilliant political satire. no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u.s.: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.another good film from this era, rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, accurately, that the u.s. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.a clever plot, good acting, some big stars (john cusack, ben kingsley, marisa tomei anyone?) and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit. unfortunately, americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.

"the first war to be 100% outsourced." dan ackroyd's line says it all. this is a hard to describe film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. it reminded once or twice of dr. strangelove, especially so in the scenes featuring ben kingsley (who did a remarkable job i think). i had no particular expectations of this film, though i am a big john cusack fan, so i just let the movie wash over me. and as a result i was quite entertained. the political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the us military-business complex. the sub-plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile. i can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the us, but for the rest of the world, it is a timely tale.

war inc. is a funny but strange film. the actors are likable, the film is likable also, but i don't know how to describe the plot. i will go into the plot later on. this is a movie with some weird casting choices. besides john cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked. here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that. her character is odd. there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants. and hits on hauser(cusack). there is a twist in the end involving the two characters. it makes sense.that is the only casting choice i am going into. cause it just plain strange. the whole movie is strange. but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored. here we have some of the best actors out there. excluding miss duff. she ain't great. but here we have john cusack, marisa tomeii, joan cusack, ben kingsley. see what i mean?this is the story of a hit-man named hauser(cusack). he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif(not the actor). while trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help out the wedding of a popstar(played by hilary duff). and he falls in love with a news reporter(played by marisa tomeii). there is a thing about the popstar though. hauser is disgusted by her. there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up.the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why. the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming. but that doesn't matter. this is a strange, funny, and entertaining comedy. i love most of the actors. so really, how could i not recommend it?war,inc.:3.5/5

this film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen. if you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how good of a story it is, how very well written the script is, and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money.all the elements of a great film are here. the visuals, though shot on digital, were gorgeous in places. the bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just amazing. it's such a trippy piece of work, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film. it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there.

this movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) it contained great backdrops and sets. 2) it showed the disparity of a war-torn environment alongside a technological one. 3) john cusack's acting was terrific. he portrayed angst very well. 4) it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects. i was also impressed with the acting for the most part. hilary's acting was, i found, the most stilted. the morals and values of everyone in a war-torn situation are up for grabs. the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. great stuff. psp

war, inc. (2008) **1/2 john cusack, marisa tomei, hilary duff, joan cusack, ben kingsley, dan aykroyd, sergej trifunovic, lyubomir neikov, ned bellamy, (voice of: montel williams)a hit-and-miss-21st century "strangelove"john cusack  who co-wrote the script with mark leyner and jeremy pikser  stars as a jaded hit-man named brand hauser who is burnt out but decides to follow thru on one final assignment by icing a middle-eastern oil minister named omar sharif (yes, not that omar sharif but you get the tone here from this misfire for a laugh) commandeered by the ex-vice president of the usa (aykroyd, cusack's old "grosse pointe blank" co-hort, doing a mean dick cheney manqué turn here), enlisting brand to do the deed under the guise of a trade show producer in mythical turaqistan (read: iraq/afghanistan) for the american private corporation tamerlane (read: halliburton). while being briefed brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he comes across intrepid journalist natalie hegalhuzen (tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. meanwhile tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of eastern european teen sensation yonica babyyeah (a surprisingly decent duff aping her own celebrity with tongue- through-cheek) and the idiot son of the country's leader.what follows is a bold attempt for a 21st century black comedy a la "dr. strangelove" but for all intense and purposes there are sadly more misses than hits in this broad try for laughs amidst political message (an unjust war being outsourced by american capitalism, check!) while cusack riffs on his martin blank from the aforementioned "pointe" he does add some nice touches of his man in black (he does shots of tabasco sauce to take the edge off), the rest of the cast plays catch up (except sister joan who is a riot as the high-strung aide- de-camp for hauser and has one of the film's funniest laugh-out lines: "my mass communications skills are finally paying off") for the most part. cusack visited the iraq war earlier this year in the 180 degree different "grace is gone" and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve ; while admirable overall the film's pace and rhythms are off largely no-thanks to first time filmmaker joshua seftel making his directorial debut here (and it is noticeable) except for maybe the well-choreographed fight hauser is involved with babyyeah's idiotic fiancé's entourage.a nice attempt yet a misguided failure ; maybe next time cusack won't try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself.

first, someone mentioned here that because this was released in "limited" quantity it means that it should be bad...that is exactly what the "big five" hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can "pass" or "ignore" features that are not desirable, without loosing face or imagine by censoring them directly. to the point, this production has been released "limited" because is considered "unpatriotic" by certain individuals.now i absolutely loved this feature; i find it way better then "charlie wilson's war" even if it is a "fictional" account of something that "never" happens but is always so obvious.this goes to anyone and everyone interested or affected by present american foreign policies, "home" or "aboard". the "turakistan" country and "the emerald city" are definitely trying to resemble iraq and baghdad just as much as the corporation "tamerlane" goes for "haliburton" (with the vice- president dan aykroyd playing dick cheney, lol).there are quiet a moments actually where the movie is dead serious, not even sarcastic anymore (main example would be as how john cusack character deals with his depression, but not only). i found that all the characters can be related to something/someone or specific stereotypes. now word of advise; if you are not politically active, especially towards the aspects of "globalization" , you will likely not enjoy this feature much since most of its content and inside "jokes" are targeting certain "personalities" that are not "visibile" to the general public on daily bases...(main exception would be hilary duff that plays the well known materialistic pop star, need i say name(s)?). at its core the feature is an anti-globalization gig, period. the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance. joan has a line at one point that goes like this: "and here we have a book written by you know who, about how i conquered the world and resolved the issues with my dad".priceless)))the sister and brother cusacks play good together as always, same as in "grosse pointeblank" i would say a bit more "mature".marisa tomeihere does not show her butt and breasts to "impress" us (like she did recently in "before the devil knows you're dead"), but instead she has a very serious role, and manages to pull it off quiet well.many critics don't get it (can not do so, or do not want to). this is not a "regular" movie but more of a comic documentary. this feature stands to deliver a message and not to get oscars, or have "visuals" sort of getting the viewer into buying the latest "hdtv experience" tv sets...i have noticed even in my local papers that this movie gets bad re-views because is not "artistic", while pro iraq war movies get good thumbs up for being "balanced" apparently and "engaging".makes one wonders how much all the world mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guys...i bet this feature will prove a hit overseas as much more then it will in north america. as i mentioned before, it is all a satire about american foreign policy and how it has been hijacked by "special interests" groups... having the "regular" american soldier wearing the "tamerlane" corporate logo on its combat dress is pretty insulting but effective in showing reality as it is, or will be soon the way things go so far.some priceless shots: upon "liberation", the country gets invaded commercial advertisements; a hilarious scene about how future journalists will likely gather "news"("anything is got to be better then this x-box bullocks"))); soldiers dealing with their "frustration"; overall, i do not recommend this to "conservatives" or "hard core" patriots of some kind or another.this feature is not made to reach to the "minds of souls" of the people(as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do so).instead it contains a message well defined for realists, and towards some ideological goals apparently "always" short of realizing.

brand hauser (john cusack) is an assassin for the cia. he is ordered to go to the country of turaquistan, a nation that the united states has "liberated", and kill a businessman named omar shariff. this is because the american conglomerate, tamerlane, that is putting the country "back together" will not stand for shariff, an oil man from a neighboring state, laying down his own pipeline through war-torn turquistan. but, once there, brand runs into difficulties. one, he meets a determined journalist, natalie (marisa tomei) who wants to tell the american public the "true" story of the region's conflict...and of tamerlane. but, brand is aghast to realize that natalie's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to lose focus on his mission. also, his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop-singing princess, yonica (hillary duff), who will be getting married at the convention center. she is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn brand's attention away from the coming assassination. with other inept underlings and complications, will brand be able to carry out his mission, for the satisfaction of tamerlane's big boss, the former vice-president (dan ackroyd)? good for you, john cusack, to make this film, even though it doesn't quite hold together. shot in serbia, it is a worthy look at what present-day iraq must be like, a country turned upside-down. in a stroke a brilliance, the green zone here is called "the emerald city" and aptly so, for this oz-like neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis. the cast is very fine, with cusack doing a nice job and tomei, joan cusack, ben kingsley, ackroyd and others backing him up in style. duff, especially, does a great turn as the heavily-accented, heavily made-up, potty-mouthed singer. the recreation of war-riddled baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch. as for the script, it isn't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes. for example, a young turaqui boy offers to show brand an enemy hideout, in exchange for money and candy. brand produces the cash but, because he has no candy, the boy burns his vehicle anyway. brilliant! then, also, the direction is not a total success but doesn't lag very often. no, if you have conservative leanings, you probably won't like this film one bit. but, if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the "war on terrorism", this is quite a good show. therefore, do make an effort to view it, as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio "formulas".

on this 4th of july weekend it's heartening to see the spirit of the declaration of independence alive and well in the film "war, inc." just as our founding fathers gave the back of their collective hand to king george iii, this film exposes in hilarious fashion the craven war-profiteering by the current crop of capitalistic creeps who are intent on indecently privatizing the government, to include privatizing war itself.the cast in this satire absolutely shines. john cusack is wonderful as a droll, conflicted corporate assassin, and the beautiful marisa tomei is superb as his love interest. (my gosh, "george costanza" was right. marisa tomei is so attractive!) but it is john's sister joan cusack who really steals the film. her portrayal of a bossy, yet simultaneously sycophantic, personal assistant is priceless, and more than once i just couldn't stop laughing at the brilliance of her performance. she not only possesses fantastic comic timing, her face is as expressive as one could ever wish for in an actor. dan ackroyd, too, has a short, but very effective, cameo in the film as the head of the company which is running the war, the tamerlane corporation. sitting on a "throne" with his pants down around his ankles, ackroyd even looks like the arse clown who currently occupies one of our real thrones of power. you won't have to think too hard to recognize that person. much of this movie was filmed in bulgaria, which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment. (you just know that the us military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of war-profiteering.) i especially enjoyed the character of "omar sharif" as played by the bulgarian actor lyubomir neikov. in one scene in which he is on the dance floor with marisa tomei he has a couple of lines that could summarize our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we install - and uninstall - in power.naturally, this film won't appeal to everyone. if you believe that the on-going privatization of our foreign policy, the military, intelligence collection and analysis, prisons and the corrections system, public health, and a myriad of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film. if you believe, however, that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporation's bottom line is an abomination i think you'll find much to appreciate in this film. nothing could be more in keeping with the spirit of independence that heaping well-deserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be.

this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me. it's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film. it's plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film. the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff. it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the 'chick-flick' genre she's used to. her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed. it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary, and i have seen most of her films. her character, yonica babyyeah is described as 'the britney spears of eastern europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song, 'i want to blow you... ... ... up'. you also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, yonica is a very complex and confused character. joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour, but also her facial expressions and so on. john cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout. i strongly recommend this film.

in war, inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities we are currently doing in afghanistan and iraq. if you are familiar with the antics of halliburton, kellogg, brown & root and blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of cusack's latest piece. cusack plays a corporate hit-man named brand hauser who finds himself in turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target. while there he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by marisa tomei and pursued by the over-sexualized pop star played by hilary duff. we are introduced to hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named marsha dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him (and played hilariously by joan cusack). while some moments are played suitably over the top, they aren't always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise. all the principals turn in solid performances. duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her disney image. tomei is funny but understated while the cusack's own nearly every scene they are in. to be fair, they are given good material. the writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion. in fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns it's way to the expected conclusion.if you like your comedy broad and physical, there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie. on the other hand, if you like sly comedy and broad satire, this is for you.

this film needs to be seen. the truest picture of what is going on in the world that i've seen since darwin's nightmare. go see it! and if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd. the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through, though hardly perfect. joan cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is good too. it's inspiring that john cusack got this movie made, and, i believe, he had to use some of his own money to do it. it's a wild, absurd ride, obviously made without the resources it needed, but still succeeds. jon stewart, steven colbert, snl, even bill maher haven't shown the guts to say what this film says.

the plot of this film might not be extraordinary, but what makes the film really special, are its characters (and the actors who play them  of course!). i won't go into the details of the plot of the movie, but i would certainly like to say this  this film is not just for everyone! the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire. if you're not alert even for a second, you'll probably end up missing one of the subtle points. the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff - like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan, the advertisements on the tankers (which i almost missed) and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout.coming to the actors, john cusack has played his multi-faceted role very efficiently (what with him being the co-writer and the producer too) and he plays his character  hauser, the killer with a heart  exquisitely. cusack's done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank, but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb.however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff! i have always been a huge fan of ms. duff. but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she's playing in the movie. but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor. let's face it! the kid's growing, but yes, so is her talent! all those critics, who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act, will be silent for a while. hilary had to play a really complex character  tough on the outside, yet a sweet child on the inside  and she's done complete justice to it. she makes you laugh, and she makes you cry  to cut the long story short ('cause i could go on raving about her for ever) she's brilliant! marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too. especially, joan's hysterics are uproarious! however, i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster.in general war, inc. keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor, and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot. i would highly recommend this movie to all (and more so to hilary duff fans)!!! p.s. - i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon!!!

in this satire of the commercialization and 'lightheartedness' of war, john cusack plays brand hauser, an assassin sent to to 'turaqistan' to take out omar sharif, who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the us's own company. in addition to this, hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer, a wedding for pop princess yonica (hillary duff), and a nosy liberal journalist, natalie (marisa tomei).assessing the technical aspects: - the acting (by the main characters,at least) was good, as was to be expected. some of john cusack's dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it. . . maybe unrealistic is more accurate. joan put forth a great, and often hilarious, performance. marisa tomei, while i've never been a big fan of hers, was more than suitable for the role and worked well. hillary duff, however, was pretty terrible. they needed an attractive middle eastern (or russian, or whatever that accent was supposed to be) pop-star. unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with her.- like i said above, the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points, especially john cusack's dialogue. not much of it, mind, but some. the story also got a bit ludicrous at points, which is fine for a satire to a point, but it took it to a whole new level here. luckily, the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool, calm demeanor throughout, and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors.- joshua seftel, who previously had a drought of real credits to his name, did a fine job with a rather wide-spectrum film. he handled the small ($10 million) budget very well, stretching it to make it appear to be much more. seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story. . . with the painful and hard-to-watch parts of the real war (including slaughter of civilians, etc.).- as far as the general satire goes, its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done, especially the 'golden palace poker' ads on the u.s. tanks. at points, it becomes a little too much, but, in the end, it still accurate portrays what it's going for an a young 'mel brooks'-type of style.overall, the film is very well made for the meager budget and it's definitely worthy of a look. it won't go down as one of the great satires of cinema, but it's certainly not the worst.7/10.

i came across an insomniac's nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films, and glad to say it did not disappoint. this crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through, and the ending was excellent - one of those nooooo moments that really stays with you. i've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down. the little ghostie girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show. she creeped the heck out of me, i can say that much. nanavati did a great job putting this short together. all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she's a great writer from what she did with this script. so well written. it's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. the directing was great and the acting was enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay. good job to this girl, i can't wait to see more!

i don't want to spend to long here rambling about the plot- you've seen the trailer, and if you haven't its online. i don't recommend seeing it though- it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughs or magic from the film. so those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance. it's really funny. i was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film. the first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics- my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad austin powers film in the final 20. this however, is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film (which is normally the case). everyone gives a great performance (especially joan cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout. i personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out- only to catch all the details which i was laughing over during the first viewing!

let me start by saying that "war, inc" is not everyone's cup of tea. it is, however, very enjoyable (and gets you thinking - "oh, crap"). the comedy involved the film isn't obvious at all - it's quite subtle (tamerlane tanks, dry-cleaning service etc), and it changes with the twists & turns in the plot.i may be the only one, but i won't compare this with "grosse point blank", because, it's different. john cusack - i wouldn't say he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. on the other hand, his sister (joan cusack) was incredible in her delivery of lines & comedic timing - even though she was hardly in the film (i'd say the same about ben kingsley).marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter, and manages to pull it off. hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah. duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (even though her accent is a tad unreal).overall, the film is what i would call "entertaining". it doesn't have a particular storyline, and it's quite silly at times, but it does have a subtle message. i'd say it's worth a watch.

joshua seftel's first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about just as the title suggests: the corporations effect on war.the film is about a mercenary (john cusack) traveling to turaqistan (not a real country, fyi) to help the american government 'get their message across' to turaqistan's leaders. he meets a reporter (marisa tomei) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter. somewhere in the mix, a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in. as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan's most important people (a son of the president), a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star, well, somewhat. the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar; no more than fifteen seconds later, the film hooks you. with it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics, the film's running time blows by you. the film has a lot more action than i expected, with the occasional scene of war, well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder. though the story isn't much deep, the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike.in the final act of the film, the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled. i thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and i could understand why. twist after twist is what the ending is all about, and like most films, it is a true hit/miss situation. regardless, the three writers on the film (mark leyner, jeremy pikser & john cusack) did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation overseas.joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the film's integrity; not reducing the material to the most redundant of films (which i was afraid would happen). seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could: he created a vibrant atmosphere, one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all. seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. no missteps here. hopefully, he takes on more directorial jobs, for he is one director to look out for.

don't mistake "war inc." for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. it isn't.this is an old-fashioned screwball comedy, with ridiculously coincidental plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by john cusack, joan cusack, marisa tomei and hillary duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content.you see, the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true. yeah, we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons, and american imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now -- but none of that is the point.here, all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon -- sometimes in genius ways -- as the backdrop for a silly romp, as john cusack's character (the hit-man with a heart) tries to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesn't trust him (tomei) and the young middle eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage (duff). cusack's sister, joan, plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss.that's all, and it works. it's simple fun, but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would supplant theirs, then you might not find it as funny.for all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.

i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for. though it has its confusing parts of the plot, it doesn't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie. that being said, if you're not open to more liberal political ideas, then this probably isn't the movie for you. i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding. each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing. i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area, but that's intentionally done. john cusack is right in that although it's set in the future, it really makes you see the present.

i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time, and i was not disappointed. the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic. as a part insomniac myself, i can relate with how the story develops. i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary. it was a great film, worth every penny. i hope that one day i can work with tess myself, it would be an honor and beyond. i can recommend it for everybody. maybe not small children as they may get scared. but if you are an insomniac like me, you'll understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. you'll love it. f.

have to be honest and say that i haven't seen many independent films, but i thought this one was very well done. the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction. the angles, settings, and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped. many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good director).

one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the well-concocted visuals, the unsettling backdrops, and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two), you can feel terry gilliam's presence through the experience. "12 monkeys" is evidence of gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. "12 monkeys" is a variation on similar themes of gilliam's repertoire:oppressive/recessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel realms. in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know. this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness. the difference between gilliam and artsy posers is that gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled. his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. the title itself is a mark of gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. all in all, gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience. the film has immense re-watch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. definitely one of my favorites.

time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. they're fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way. film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek: first contact', the 'back to the future' trilogy, 'bill and ted's excellent adventure', 'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage, 'window of opportunity'. heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time.in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film, '12 monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film. repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind.some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard cole, played by bruce willis, as a schizophrenic. most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel.unlike other time travel stories, '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. cole tells his psychiatrist, railly (madeleine stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised. if that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much.if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events...or does it? the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians.bonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing. gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the 'munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'don quixote'. i would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting i've seen. it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved. gilliam's description of the film as his "7½th" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really 'his' film' - doesn't do the film itself justice.brad pitt's portrayal of goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic. watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum. it's disturbing and distracting.probably a coincidence, the louis armstrong song 'what a wonderful world' was used at the end of both '12 monkeys' and the final episode of the tv series of 'the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy'. both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones.'12 monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain. it's not a mindless recreation, that's for sure.

twelve monkeys is an insane time-travelling, action packed movie that stars bruce willis who plays james cole, a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in november of 1996. unfortunately, he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane.this movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from bruce willis, brad pitt and madeleine stowe. twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that i believe anybody can enjoy. terry gilliam has created a true masterpiece10/10

one of the greatest film i have seen this year.last maybe before sun rise, which is also seen late at night alone in the lab. i like the idea of the film,which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate.with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes. i do like the end. but a big question also comes. the virus shall not be released again, should it?in the last scene in the airport. jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists. when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus. and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr. goines assistant. so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus,(james keep an eye on him at the time remember?) and he has teeth. so why everything is still happen?? why future scientists don't do anything after the truth is revealed?? my biggest question after the film...

terry gilliam traveled again to the future (he had already done it in "brazil") to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race.the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and gilliam proves that he's got imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). as for the cast, bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just ok, but brad pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all. he should just play good-looking successful young men.*my rate: 7/10

a very strong movie. bruce is good and brad also.as i think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list bruce remembered.that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job.well, novikov property seems to me work in this movie. however, i do believe in back to the future theory of worlds' multiplicity.so bruce could save the world, but not his world.in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself.and i do believe there is no problem in that. here i disagree with dr. brown from back...but the story pf 12 monkeys has its own beauty. inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost.a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future. the bullet - well it might be some mistake, some falsification.well i like this movie - has to buy a dvd.best.

one of the all-time great science fiction works, as visionary and thought-provoking as blade runner or even gilliam's own brazil. willis gives his best performance here, but he's outdone by pitt's incredibly frenetic turn that's unlike anything he's done before or since. even stowe isn't out of her league here, though. the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about. the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. lots of dark humour on display here. fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography. in my top ten.

"twelve monkeys" is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. it cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named james cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr. kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films.the story is just fantastic. it's so original and so entertaining. the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named "la jetée" (1962) which i haven't seen, but i must thank the director and writer of the movie, chris marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of "twelve monkeys". i read a little about "la jetée", it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by paul buckmaster.terry gilliam, who we remember from monty python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as i really never thought him as a director type of a person. i know he has directed movies before, but i really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. it shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. it's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all.what comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example "the sixth sense" as well, but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well. the character is very well written too, yet performed even better. cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. by hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt. stow plays the role of kathryn railly, the psychiatrist of james cole, who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. she somehow starts to believe cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it, so i guess i'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing.all in all, "twelve monkeys" is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from willis and pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. it's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures i've ever seen. through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing.

i really enjoyed this -- i'm a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. but then, terry gilliam is always good at that (well, almost always. let's just forget about jabberwocky and the brothers grimm, shall we?).i particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes -- the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other.it was also really well done aesthetically -- the art direction was really great, and i wish i'd been able to see it on the big screen. the future scenes had a similar feel to brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling.but perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors i normally don't much like, bruce willis and brad pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. pitt especially -- i'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act (contrary to what i'd originally thought), but this one really outdid them. i actually found myself asking my friends at one point "are you sure that's brad pitt?" this is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admittedly that may not be saying too much).

terry gilliam gives a stunning movie, which i thoroughly enjoyed. bruce willis, madeline stowe, brad pitt and even the small appearance of christover plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant! this is the only terry gilliam film i've seen, and twelve monkeys is definitely in my top 10. i think this is one of the four best bruce willis movies; and brad pitt's best. brad pitt delivers a perfect performance. possibly one of the ten best actor's performance that i've ever seen. he played his role (geoffrey) very convincingly. bruce willis' role (james cole) was also quite convincing. both bruce willis and brad pitt acted extraordinarily well. with the brilliant story to back the great performances; and to back that up, terry gilliam's superb directing.

the story of this film is truly remarkable. a virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say, "the twelve monkeys did it." thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 billion people. apparently animals do not contract this disease. day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (or at least thats what the poster says.) so a current convict named james cole (bruce willis) is sent as a "volunteer" to get some samples from above. after he does his "volunteer" work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin.throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times, from 1990, to some time during the 1950's. (in a middle of a war.) throughout the time traveling back and forth, it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up. the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending. i personally didn't like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed. i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen, but it isn't everyone who thinks this way. so i gave it a 8, but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a 6 or 7.for the whole acting of the film, i give it a a+. bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good, but brad pitt is completely 100% excellent. his acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club. there characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more... insane in this film. so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out. for most people it's a great science fiction film, i just don't think it is a masterpiece.

first of all, we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. the story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. about that. movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. but that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. as far as the direction goes, it is prefect. movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. so, if you are getting ready to see a sci-fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. b there should be more movies like this.

a great addition to anyone's collection.12 monkeys is a movie you don't see every day. it has excellent actors to go with a excellent story. this is not a normal role for bruce willis but he holds the role like he holds john mcclane.the virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it.a man(bruce)is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind.the actors in this were awesome. i must give a mention to brad pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient james cole(bruce) meets in a mental hospital.the director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus.the animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities.this movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own.i very much highly recommend it.10/10

i can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. it is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still i can't decide. i definitely liked it. this is the first movie of terry gilliam that i have seen. my first impression? i was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex(to be confusing).the movie is set in the future. a man james cole(bruce willis) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past(1996 to be specific). a virus killed 5 billion people. he is sent from the future to get some information about it. also involved here are a psychiatrist called kathryn railly. the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life. the loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end.one thing i liked about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life. "you want to see the ocean, be with her" is especially a poignant line in this movie. it chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on. this is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. the complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters.the performances are quite good. bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. his desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. i have to check out his other movies. the gorgeous madeleine stowe is quite a treat to watch. ever since i saw this movie, i have become so obsessed with her. she has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him. brad pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named jeffrey goines. his oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him.the end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. the length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. and every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary.good thriller 10/10

i just bought the dvd and i must say, (after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas) terry does it again. as well of being a fan of the monty python movies, terry gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller, whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as james cole, and as well (perhaps my favorite character) brad pitt who played the insanity of jefferey goines. a must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any type really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. any way the plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race, which is unleashed in the past by "the army of twelve monkeys". james cole( bruce willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists in his time can find a cure. before i go further, james cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. during his stay he meets jefferey goins( brad pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. he also meets his psychiatrist ((madelein stowe) who eventually teams up with bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually brad pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away.

nb: spoilers within. this great movie is "about" so many things, all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story.the ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. whew! such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot, coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples, not to mention the inspiration of chris marker's "la jetee." without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. but there are many other levels speaking here.the movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of james cole (bruce willis, doing the best work of his career here). his journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again. the other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between james and dr. kathryn railly (the wonderful madeleine stowe). i love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters. for me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene. by this point, james  once gripped by an unshakable determination  now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality; while dr. railly  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced, after absorbing james's proofs, of his horrific predictions. her desperation to get through to james and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come.gilliam makes us care about these characters, especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives. the balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite. and the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through james's dreams. it is here, just after james has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind. see jose and the gun (just before this, the references to hitchcock's "vertigo" and identity switching/confusion are brilliant.) this is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people; it not only holds up under repeated viewings, it demands them. "twelve monkeys" is intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny, and suspenseful stuff.the supporting cast is excellent, especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as jeffery goines, crazed and spoiled, but ever the survivor. and there is david morse as dr. peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation) and christopher plummer as dr. goines. but the biggest accolades belong to terry gilliam, surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding "brazil." (lots of parallels, of course, especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings: lunacy within, lunacy without.) every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone. the soundtrack is terrific, too.this is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come.

normally i try to avoid sci-fi movies as much as i can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. light sabers, ufo's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. however, there is one movie in the genre that i'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this "twelve monkeys" i remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, i'm still one of its biggest fans. every time i see it, this movie seems to get better and better.somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. james cole is one of them. he's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. they believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'the twelve monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. but their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets dr. kathryn railly, a psychiatrist, and jeffrey goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...what i like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of the twelve monkeys? those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. if the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, i'm sure that i would never have liked it as much as i did now. it's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. but that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. the acting is amazing too. normally i'm not too much a fan of bruce willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. together with madeleine stowe and brad pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.even after several viewings, i'm still a huge fan of this movie. except for this movie, i have only seen one other terry gilliam movie and that's "fear and loathing in las vegas", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. however, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. i give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10.

terry gilliam's and david peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. people's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  i especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.the story itself is engaging: one man, james cole (played by bruce willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. but because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. with such a complex movie, it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess, but instead twelve monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.i watched this movie once around 10 years ago. it marked me a lot: i remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. i've re-watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it's better than i remembered it. brad pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing jeffrey goines  almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. pitt's oscar nomination was well deserved! surprising was also bruce willis' performance: his i didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. cole is a rather ambiguous character, peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. ironically cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole's shrink, dr. kathryn railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. but then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.there are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club, and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. the twist is brilliant, but i prefer this ending for emotional impact. madeleine stowe is very good playing dr. railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. it reminds me of chinatown in that sense, the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.the twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling cole's mission hasn't been in vain. twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. it's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.

without a doubt, 12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci-fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality. an apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound, 12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout. excellent use of philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place.bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen. he is actually sane, but the people of the future (or present if you will) distort this guy's head so bad through time travel, no wonder he unravels. he gets sent to world war i just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it. they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance, we get to see willis, madeleine stowe and an ominous brad pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years.stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as cracked up as he seems. a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of "seeing" each other before, in another place or time. 12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present, when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world.the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for willis' plight to complete his mission which is, against all usual hollywood stereotype, not to save the world. he is gathering information. the film plays tricks on the viewer as well, placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin. this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making. he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time bandits, and brazil. the screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films. if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 monkeys.rating: 9 of 10

a linear travel within a non-linear structure. it's a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this come-and-go between present, future and past. however, the movie's linearity can't be avoided: it's the very work of the projector, the unfolding of the narrative.what we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. the world of this terry gilliam film is a world with little space for free-will.right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic's prophecy, according to which a plague would rule the earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus.cole's (willis) mission is clear: return to the mid 90's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus. there's no way to change the past: all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present (that, for us viewers, is the future) find the cure. not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the present better.in his "returns" in time, cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present.the latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect "volunteers" (this word is incisively ironic) to embark on the journeys to the past.the scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel, and cole ends up on wrong dates - this will, later in the plot, work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist kathryn (stowe).we can see, through the evolution of the story, that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality.there is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climactic - appears. it modifies itself, according to the evocation of cole's memories, that come up in his dreams.in an airport, a man is shot dead while running, armed, toward someone else. a blonde woman runs after the murdered one.this is the scene that connects the past (in which cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the narrative) and the future (adult cole) throughout the narrative, cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now. his prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. the agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist, doctor peters (morse), that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease.what was can't be changed. and, in cole's case, what was is what will be. eternally.a film not quite well understood for many. to me, nothing less than a masterpiece.other good movies with similar theme: the back to the future trilogy (that has another angle regarding the "mad scientist" character, and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - particularly in the second film -, it is way more optimistic than gilliam's work, that is an odd hollywood picture).in another register, there is "wild strawberries", one of bergman's masterpieces, that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences.i've never watched "la jetée", but only because i can't find it.

the big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow. but good there is also a pause-button. bruce willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the first world war and how messed up it all might look like, terry gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. this ex-monty phyton man knows exactly how genius sf-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic brad pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb bruce willis who proves he is more than some schwarzenegger-wanna be. it's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. one of my big favourites.

there is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between bruce willis and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkeys. gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the fifth element) and handed it to butch bruce. it was entitled "things bruce willis does when he acts". it ended with a simple message saying: "please don't do any of the above in my movie".there is a fact about this movie (definitely true). gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.i would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is the twelve monkeys.visually, the twelve monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film. it is also full of gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. although the ending of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, gilliam borrows heavily from kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. it is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.i love gilliam films (brazil, in particular). but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. he seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (brazil, in particular). i still maintain that brazil is gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that the twelve monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-python.whatever the truth of the rumour above, gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - brad pitt.it's been over a decade since this film was released. when i watched it again, i realised that it hadn't really aged. i had changed, of course. and this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. a first rate film. 8/10.

with 'twelve monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate. i know i did. the story is interesting and deals with time traveling. a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole (bruce willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. there he meets jeffrey goines (brad pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. he also meets psychiatrist dr. kathryn railly (madeleine stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing cole's stories.the movie constantly plays with time. cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and "they" send someone. for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. you could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.'twelve monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. may be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. that was the easy part for me.

stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. the fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.terry gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film. he gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy. his world, the world in which twelve monkeys transpires, is a place where the mad run wild, where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect, where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence, where madness looms at every corner. this is a very dark movie, but his very best, most linear (despite the plot twists which hold up under examination), and one which gets better with repeated viewings.a tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of life on the planet as we have known it leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity's fate on the earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time, among them one james cole (underplayed to great effect by bruce willis). cole could be any person. we don't know anything about him, but in a way, that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. what we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality: he may have already been at the scene of the event of 1996.it's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. when taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets jeffrey goines (spastically played by brad pitt, oscar-nominated here) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction, and later cole believes he has seen goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? he doesn't know. later he meets a psychologist, kathryn railly (madeleine stowe), and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane, and that she's seen him before. this becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that something terrible is coming this way, especially when she meets him six years later: she has seen cole before. at the same time, cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (jeffrey goines?) has apparently escaped, not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. the questions arise: have these events happened? are they going to happen? who is really a part of this, or better yet -- is everyone, down to the smallest player, a part of a greater plot? or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again? these questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece vertigo in which madeleine elster/judy barton mourns her own brief existence ("you took no notice," she says, as cole and railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in). snippets of dialog from vertigo form a foil to the dialog between railly and cole and later, when cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for railly, he comes face-to-face with her in disguise (looking almost exactly like eva maria saint from north by northwest) as the swelling bernard herrmann score plays the emergence of judy barton, dressed as madeleine elster. it's a fascinating sequence, more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films: madeleine stowe plays kathryn railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself "judy simmons" while helping an "insane" man named james cole; james stewart plays a detective who tries to help "insane" madeleine elster who will later re-appear not once, but twice, first as brunette judy barton, and later, as madeleine. action and re-enaction, play and re-play.

terry gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of chris marker's short film la jetee is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast. gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole (willis at his most steve mcqueen-like -- better than mcqueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals. willis, the justifiably oscar-nominated brad pitt, and madeline stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers. even paul buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting. this one's a don't-miss!

i had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film. at the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were "awesome. just awesome." i like to think i can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so.the story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. back with universal after his long, arduous battle with them over "brazil", terry had achieved what he wanted most; the "final cut". terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. it is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.the universal collector's edition dvd of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. it contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called "the hamster factor and other tales of 12 monkeys". it tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair. fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success. 

just kidding, i rented 12 monkeys the other day because i am a huge bruce willis fan and i heard some things about the film. some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so i was a bit worried. just because i felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that i had to watch several times to get. but i watched it last night and i was really impressed, this movie had everything in it: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. the actors all did a terrific job, i give a lot of credit to bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. but brad pitt, i'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. he didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. the story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.james cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send james to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. james gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, dr. kathryn raily and another mental patient, jeffrey goines. he tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. but the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by james, but he tells her more, and believes him. now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.12 monkeys was an incredible film. like i said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. but the whole movie was just great, the cast, the sets, just the whole picture was a great one. it had a terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. what is right and what is wrong? who knows? but i would highly recommend 12 monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, i'm sure you'll enjoy it.9/10

"twelve monkeys"'s got all the elements to become terry gilliam's masterpiece. an outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. "twelve monkeys" is also the first movie where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in "die hard"). no matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. the movie contains a very thrilling end too. it's got a real dramatic power. but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). no matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.

terry gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts bruce willis' best performance ever.what sets 12 monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that bruce willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to. also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed. as willis asserts "it's already happened," while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself. it's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by peoples and gilliam's unique brand of dementia.besides this, 12 monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of hitchcock's vertigo. all serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.visually, gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling tim burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery. with cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters. the scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.performance-wise, brad pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an oscar nomination. as mentioned, bruce willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. equally good is madeline stowe as willis' psychologist. she holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10

other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film. that's simply not true and a little unfair.the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity. i don't think there's anything wrong with the tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together. perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try. i thought it made the film much more interesting. perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening, but that's about the only fault i can find. nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio, also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone.

i was pretty surprised with this flick. even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good. the acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me. my only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste. but hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded.i would really recommend anyone in hollywood to look up antonella ríos who is an excellent spanish talent (something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting). antonella ríos truly is a star on the rise.

los debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who have moved to santiago from the south after their mother dies. the confident and streetwise silvio, the elder brother, gets a job working for a sleazy strip club's owner after taking the naive victor there for his 17th birthday.as silvio blossoms under his boss's tutelage, both brothers get involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, gracia. as the film unfolds, characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and overt ways that each one manipulates the next.the film is well made, with good cinematography and fast pacing. it's also pretty sexy, with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes. it uses the now-popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view, out of chronological sequence. many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on - memento, pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, and many other good films use this device. the plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of body heat, pulp fiction, and many other good film noir.as the different layers are revealed, our understandings of the characters and their motivations evolve. while the plot may be somewhat cliché, it is also clever and entertaining.i would call it an enjoyable movie, worth watching, but nothing memorable. i haven't seen many films from chile, and it's always interesting to see film noir from other countries. other than that, rent it if it's available but don't lose any sleep if it isn't.

an intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of temuco.film debutant daniella rios is the seductive erotic dancer gracia, working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini-wave in chilean film production, alejandro trejo. the elder brother, played maturely by nestor cantillana, is easily convinced to become trejo's lead henchman, after a night at the stripclub to celebrate younger brother victor's (juan pablo miranda) seventeenth birthday. from the establishing shot of this opening scene, the film explodes into neo-noir exploration of everything the outside world doesn't usually expect to see in this country so stereotypically conservative and catholic.gracia's charms of seduction attract the three men like bees to honey, although the circular narrative of the three-way fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between trejo's men and the 'gringo', eduardo barril. power relations become a vital theme, as society's outsiders merge in a mini-family. the prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the chilean men in the film, emerging from her ambiguous position in the periphery of society, and is seen as holding the key to all three men's futures. the relationships between trejo and cantillana become important, as the boys' parents are conspicious by their absence (one assumes they still live in temuco). therefore it is trejo, el padrino, who 'adopts' cantillana, and effectively 'makes him' as a man in the city. miranda rapidly becomes the desperate outsider, as his dependency on his 'father figure', cantillana, becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful gracia. however, miranda remains trapped by the constraint of still being in school - he is dependent on cantillana, who is dependent on trejo, for the money to survive. trejo, in turn, is under the thumb of the 'gringo', and his wealth has been accumulated through drug deals and well as his strip clubs. the figure of gracia acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful firework, she wraps a web of beauty inside the patriarchy but the strain can only lead to one climax.as the tensions of these power relations come to head, gracia remains ambiguously elusive. the viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to. the film concludes tragically and explosively in a shoot out which realigns power relations and erases half the major male protanganists. the final shot of miranda's beaten face speeding down the panamericano highway is despairingly powerful. the boy has been sucked in by the lure of the city's underworld, yet has lost his only visible family, and his woman, who is his only friend in the film. he has nothing. the overriding metaphors are bold and brave. this is a gangster film in chile. the notions of family, no sex before marriage etc, are abolished, and instead the harsh realities of the other side of santiago's coin are displayed in all their savage glory. trejo beats rios brutally, rios and miranda make love in a cinema reel room - a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows. the 'gringos' are seen to have a financial hold over this small latin american nation, but not through the copper mines, through the illegal path of drugs.waissbluth's triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld, which raises so many social questions, more perhaps than the record-breakingly successful sexo con amor, within a slick, smooth firecracker of a film, which place this film firmly alongside sexo con amor, taxi para tres, and el chacotero sentimental, as cinematic evidence that chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post-transition period 15 years after the censorship of the military regime.

director/writer andrés waissbluth worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in santiago, chile, and perhaps that is one of the reasons the resultant film seems episodic and in need of editing. or, maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytelling.two brothers - silvio the elder (néstor cantillana) and victor the younger (juan pablo miranda) - have moved to santiago from their home in temuco after their parents' death and silvio works to support victor's education. on victor's seventeenth birthday silvio takes the virgin out to the clubs where he encourages victor to lose his virginity with one of the club's stripper/prostitutes. in a tender scene victor must face his nascent impotency while silvio is out on the club floor impressing the 'owners' with his potential for hire.silvio goes to work for the 'gang' as a bodyguard/henchman and makes good money to support victor's schooling. but victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named gracia (antonella ríos) and begins to woo her, dropping out of school incurring silvio's angry disappointment. gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club gang's leader don pascual (alejandro trejo) who is silvio's boss! gracia is the glue that holds this tale together as she is the paramour of victor, silvio, and don pascual and the consequences of this bizarre ménage a trois has deadly results. through a means of re-telling the story through the eyes of victor, silvio, and gracia we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and the cracks in each character that allow for the downfall that results.sound like a chilean pulp fiction? well, it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful, dark manner that includes a lot of frontal nudity (both female and male) and provocative sexual encounters. but in the end the sensual aspect of the director's vision is what drives this film, playing on the debutante virginal psyche against the hardcore professional sex worker with success. the cast is fairly strong, especially antonella ríos in the demanding role of gracia. there are enough twists and turns and replays of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically in impact when told through the eyes of a different character. bordering on two hours, some judicious editing would have helped the impact of the film. in spanish with english subtitles. recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style and the art of south american cinema. grady harp

i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies. price portrays don gallico, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor). even though price is a murderer, i actually found myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him.although this movie doesn't have the "horror" factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, "house of wax") it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest. this is a must for vincent price fans.

to die for has it all.this film has a great cast. lots and lots of romance and terror. not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans. there are a lot more vampire love stories. if you are a fan of vampire love stories i strongly recommend this film-10/10.

small spoilers alert !!!good movie...very good movie. and i'm surprised to say that myself, because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news. most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen. this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action. this movie really fascinated me. good accomplishment, seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved. it really is the story that keeps you focused. especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied. sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth. it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle. of course, that's where the reality and the "based on a true story" stops. the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker.in this movie, the count ( vlad teppish) emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman. and they're all pretty girls, i'll give him that. overall, good acting by unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore. but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr. heck, it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title. these two films have nothing else in common, but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture. check it out...my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10

what a gem of a movie, so good that they made a sequel.the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other.bendan hughes plays the eccentric vlad, a bit of an inkling there to who this character is, who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house.hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format.the movie is watchable, but the actors' performances are very wooden and they seem as they don't want to be in this film, but may be that's just all part of the decadent ambiance.didn't like the ending, but there is a sequel, must track it down.when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes didn't really fit the part. later on, i couldn't stop thinking about him, he sort of exudes an eerie sensuality, so maybe he was right for the part.brendan hughes last seen in 'hitler - the rise of evil' as lt. guffman.where is he now?

when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of "the lost boys"(1987).to my surprise "to die for" is a really good movie.it's a little bit corny at times,but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts.this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times.highly recommended.

there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. profiler looks crispy, fortier looks classic. profiler plots are quite simple. fortier's plot are far more complicated... fortier looks more like prime suspect, if we have to spot similarities... the main character is weak and weirdo, but have "clairvoyance". people like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. how about just enjoying? funny thing too, people writing fortier looks american but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer american series (!!!). maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but i think this series is more english than american. by the way, the actors are really good and funny. the acting is not superficial at all...

this is essentially a variation on house of wax ,in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies ,vincent price.in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other,less talented and less scrupulous people .in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist ,the great rinaldo (john emery)insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs.price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi. he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer.price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy.the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease .good solid b movie melodrama , this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece .shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance

as of this writing john carpenter's 'halloween' is nearing it's 30th anniversary. it has since spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those 'top 10 scariest movies' lists it's always on there. that's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $300,000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent. i could go on and on, but the big question here is: how does the film hold up today? and all i can say to that is, fantastically! pros: a simple, but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood. an unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director/co-writer john carpenter and alan howarth. great cinematography. stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high, gets some great shots, and is careful not to show too much of his villain. good performances from the then mostly unknown cast. a good sense of humor. michael myers is one scary, evil guy. a lot of eerie moments that'll stay with you. the pace is slow, but steady and never drags. unlike most other slasher films, this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count.cons: probably not nearly as scary now as it was then. many of the goofs really stand out. final thoughts: i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series. i know that's not a popular opinion, but it's really how i feel. despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs. and just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten. no way, no how.my rating: 5/5

i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. being made almost 30 years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame. boy was i wrong. there are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine. even the acting was great, jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald pleasance was superb.on the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it. it makes all the copycats, e.g. nightmare on elm street, scream look very tame. i can't really say it is carpenter's best because i have not seen many of his, the only one i can remember of his is starman (i think he made it). halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre.

every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening, though they usually aren't. most modern horror movies fit into this category.then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual. they actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced."halloween" is such a film. it takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. but nearly all of them work. "halloween" is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole.the story is simple. laurie strode (jamie lee curtis) is babysitting some kids on halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. of course, the madman, later known as michael myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually he comes after laurie.sounds familiar, right? just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. not a chance.i think james berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of "halloween:" "because of its title, halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. however, while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member..." he has a point, and for a number of reasons. first and foremost, it's downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most of those fail as well). second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and he relies very little on it (actually, the body count is pretty low). in fact, one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie, at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. he relies on ideas for scares, and also skill. third, while some of the characters may do stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don't do them because they're dumb. the characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots, we're frightened because they're making a mistake.one of the main reasons why "halloween" is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real. nothing is hard to swallow in this film. there's no supernatural, there's no ridiculously creative plot elements, or "inventive" murders, or whatnot. instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action. what we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. it's a hit or miss game, which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has (which i'm not), they'd seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be. this is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. the actors act like real people, not characters from a story. nothing more. the exception to this is whoever plays the shape, or later known as michael myers. it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill, but it's hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). but the guy pulls it off, and the result is terrifying.this is carpenter's movie through and through. he directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score of it. this is a man of brilliance, and his later movie "the thing" supports this statement, though the thing is not as scary as "halloween." unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers "recognize your potential." as good as this film is, it's not without flaws. the famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. it's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear "the shape." luckily, carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. while there's no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. we grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. but once the film gets to halloween night, that's when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the end.while "halloween" may be flawed, it is only slightly so. it is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!

in 1978 a phenomenon began. the release of john carpenter's "halloween" got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is michael meyers. the critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated, and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history.plot: 15 years after a murder took place, four friends (all females) are babysitting(and having it on with their boyfriends) on halloween night. after escaping from a hospital the night before, michael myers returns to his home town to stalk these people. he murders 3 of them silently and subtlety. he does not speak. he walks slowly. he hides....only one of the friends escapes, after being saved by doctor loomis (michael's pursuer and doctor) there is one reason why halloween works so well. simplicity. we don't know where michael is, we don't know why he kills, and he frightens us. they're the only reasons why we are afraid.john carpenter wrote the movie, and directed. he builds unbearable tension throughout the story, and scares to such a degree, that sometimes we cannot watch. and the climax is truly startling.as horror, this is essential. it is terrifying and well acted. it is also mysterious. michael is a force, not a human. a force that cannot be denied.the sequels focused too much around michael and his "history". this movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece.

there are two movie experiences i will always cherish. the first was seeing "star wars" for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother. a close second is sneaking into halloween at the tripple plex with my good friend, trevor, in late october 1978. halloween left me breathless, speechless, and downright scared. everyone knows the story. young michael myers decides to kill his sister on halloween 1963. he escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to haddofield to wreck havoc once again. he spots laurie (jamie lee curtis), a shy senior who enjoys babysitting, and begins stalking her. her partying friends across the street are killed, one-by-one as michael sets his plot to get her. ironically, the young boy she tends on halloween is afraid of the "boogeman," and can see him outside. during the murder spree, dr. sam loomis (donald pleasance) works hard to find michael before he unleashes his fury. he has no proof, no evidence, just a hunch he has to sell to sheriff bracket (charles cyphers). as the plot unfolds, you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare. alfred hitchcock once said, "you can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off. that is a cheap thrill. however, put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off, then you have suspense." director john carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in halloween. the audience will see glimpses of him outside, watching, stalking his victims. we gasp. will he kill her? when will he kill her? then, michael disappears. carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore. this movie has little blood, but still provides good scares. one of the best scenes is michael lifting bob off the ground. he rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight, then he drives it. all you hear is a loud thud, then the audience sees bob's feet drop lifelessly. carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer. this also peaks our audience. what will he do? what's going on inside his mind? finally, carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension. moreover, the tandem screen writing he did with debra hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about. the teens are not "party mad," but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland. finally, there is some decent acting in this "b," low-budget thriller. nick castle who plays "the shape" (michael) adds something to the mindless killer. it is cold, merciless, and without any pathology. moreover, the personality does everything the same way. he kills only when trapped, or to set up a trap. he splits the victims apart. he also relies on brute strength. and that mask used (a bleached william shatner mask) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion. while pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues, he comes across as someone scared, desperate, and determined. it made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil. the crown jewel, though, is jamie lee curtis' debut. she plays the laurie character as someone scared, but also determined and strong who fights back. the end is one that left me speechless. this was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped. movies like star wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times. halloween, and other scary movies, though, do not have that advantage. so if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new, halloween would be the movie i would choose.

it was "the night he came home," warned the posters for john carpenter's career-making horror classic. set in a small american town, halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode, and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways...leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael. this plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs throughout the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as a poorly received 2007 remake. the difference between them, and this, is, quite simply, that "halloween" is the best.made on a very modest, tight budget...halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of "sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a knife/axe/chainsaw/ wielding psycho".

with a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all. john carpenter brings to life a nail-biting nightmare on halloween night, when laurie strode (jamie lee curtis in her debut, career defining role) and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun- only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell. michael myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum...having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in haddonfield, the sleepy illinois town where his murder took place. once he sets his eyes on laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk and terrorize her, turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her.beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary... with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself. myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion.although "halloween" is certainly outdated, it is by no means less chilling. the idea alone is goose bump inducing, and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day... it spawned seven sequels and eventually rob zombie's equally scary remake, and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today.

as i mentioned previously, john carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic conan the barbarian). it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers, whom i eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep. now that is terror for a 10 year old.it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves. the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works, perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious. this all could happen. it isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country (as most modern horror is, i.e. hostel, touristas, cry wolf, saw,etc). at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations. i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head. it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create. so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety.carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday, middle class, suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister. he then spends the next 15 years in an institution (which we thankfully do not experience) only to escape and return to his hometown, the infamous haddonfield. on his way he kills and kills. the child's name is michael meyers, though he is not a person. john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia. in the bastion of american safety and security, chaos can still strike.michael ceased to be a person once he killed. he is not a serial killer, human being or psychopath. he is as unstoppable force. the generic overalls, bleached-white shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete michael's generification. this is the source of all his power. he is faceless, speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos. this is helped by the cinematography (post card effect), a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence (dr. loomis). his over the top performance and uneasiness sells "the shape". this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode, the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds (at least for a little bit). though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films (black christmas came out 4 years earlier), it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing. if you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time (like me), this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack. i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter's career.

there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside.i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about.also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do.this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly, especially around halloween time.john carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween.oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don't.it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the 1978 john carpenter version better.michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film, and is a very well known one.so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.

halloween is a film i have to get out and watch every time it's that day of the year.i even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday!!!this film is so great.jamie lee curtis is an actress i can never stop loving.this movie might be old,but the story line still gets me right there every time,and the acting was absolutely fantastic!!!although i have not seen the remake,i feel already that it was totally unnecessary.i think rob zombie should have never remade such a classic.what kills me though,is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original.i am getting furious just thinking about it!!!!!!this movie was great,and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.

it took me time to really appreciate john carpenter's halloween. as a kid, i remember i really enjoyed the sequels, especially the return of michael myers, which i still think is the best halloween sequel. but i thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the point­. i watched it a couple of times recently and i know now i was wrong. today i truly understand this film, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. it's not about blood and gore. it's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. it's about the worst night in laurie strode's short life. it's about the night his demented brother comes back home to finish what he started 15 years ago. this movie is meant to be scary and i think it succeeds very well. it's also one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-genre that i always loved. halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors, such as jamie lee curtis in her first role. need i say more? anyone who's never seen it, horror fan or not, should do his cinematic homework right now. very highly recommended!

some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films. often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not the scariest.i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). i honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one, that's just how it worked out. but i would have to say this one blows all the others away. it is genuinely frightening, and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine. my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy, and leans his head to one side. it is one of the eeriest images in movie history.later slashers, such as the friday the 13th films, were more fun and less intense than this movie. i do like the f13 series better than the halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the f13 movies. michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people. i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights.what's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. it is just pure terror. it's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.

the first time i saw this movie, i fell in love with it. the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. i expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :p). the fact that i couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book. predictable horror movies bore me. now, i know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. finally, as i mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. it's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores, so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake. speaking of the remake, i read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that i know that mr. zombie reveres john carpenter, i have high hopes for his take on this classic. this movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an all hallow's eve movie marathon. :)

classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director carpenter and star curtis.seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on halloween.halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! the direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. highest kudos also go to carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. in a sense, halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!the cast is excellent. young jamie lee curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter laurie strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. the great donald pleasants does a perfect performance as a myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. supporting cast loomis, soles, castle, and others are good too.so like its own villain, halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. it is a must for all genre fans!**** out of ****

this film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. the claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! actors are fantastic, rip donald pleasance you were fantastic as dr loomis, he made the film even better. without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. jamie lee curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. she gives a tremendous performance. i loved this film since it scared me like hell back when i seen it in the very early 80's and i still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! the fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. we all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. death at any turn. halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. it's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. as well as psycho's superb storyline, both of which i adore, i believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. to me halloween and psycho are the best films i have ever seen and i will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.

this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up, but had never seen it until a few years ago. it's reputation truly proceeded it. i knew of michael myers, had seen the mask, saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed. but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the halloween franchise. boy, how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs.halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie. now, by today's standards, it isn't as graphic and visceral, but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today. the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a quaint, mid-west town is a testament to his ability. the lighting effects are down right horrifying, with "the shape" seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will. the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense.the performances by all the players are well done, with specific nods to jamie lee curtis and donald pleasance. ms. curtis is such a good laurie strode because she is so likable and vulnerable. it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her, we want her to survive and get away.donald pleasance plays dr. loomis like a man on a mission, and it works well. he adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets.overall, not only is halloween a great horror movie, but also a great film. it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up. this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie. and for an even more frightful time, try watching it alone with the lights off. don't be surprised if you think you see "the shape" lurking around in the shadows!

john carpenter's halloweenis it the greatest horror film of all time? no .. maybe not to everyone, but to me it is and always will be. the film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart. it's unfortunate i didn't get to see this film until twenty years after it's release, but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then. my father suggested before i go see halloween h20 that i whip out and rent halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after watching halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the slasher genre.the film's plot is simple, in 1963 michael audrey myers killed his sister judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. incarcerated for fifteen years where he was treated by dr. sam loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls: laurie strode an innocent bookworm, annie brackett a tough talking sarcastic and lynda van der klok a beautiful and sexually vigorous young girl. dr. loomis tracks michael here where he enlists the help of the town sheriff leigh brackett whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one, until only sweet innocent laurie is left who is the prime target on michael's list.the casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances, jamie lee curtis was stunning in her first film role as laurie strode and donald pleasance gave a thrilling performance with his small role as loomis. nick castle who portrays michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer, and his walk and body movements were perfect.one of the great highlights of this film is it's chilling score done by john carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. the blue lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young laurie is cowering against a wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadows behind her michael's face materializes before he strikes. michael's mask was one of the thing's that sent chills down my spine the most, the white emotionless face worked perfectly.what makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy friday the 13th films, in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension. it became so clear that halloween spawned movies like friday the 13th and characters like jason voorhees, whom he is a mere rip off of michael myers.to sum it up, i suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time.

halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. he takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. this is just the start of things to come from michael myers.donald pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying myers for years. he knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. this evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.after an escape from an institution, myers tracks down his younger sister. if he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.there have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. but this one started it all, sort of. if you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls. well, if it wasn't for halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.halloween's director, john carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.this film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. it's been copied from and ripped off of, but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. it still gives you chills listening to carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers.

i must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. the unique way that john carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. the sound, the menacing horror of michael meyers and the infamous scream of jamie lee curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. i love the music, i love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. there is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of michael's true nature. is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? that question may never be truly answered, but carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.john carpenter is the master of horror. while lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see ghosts of mars), halloween began his powerhouse of a career. this is his ultimate film. while he did release other greats, i will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. with the power of his camera, he places these images of meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. i loved every scene in which we panned back and there was michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. that was scary, yet utterly brilliant. i loved the scenes in which carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. there you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where carpenter gets you, it isn't. michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. this leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.then, if you just didn't have enough of michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, carpenter adds that chilling theme music. i still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if meyers is looking at me through the window. carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. it is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's horror hollywood could muster. carpenter's halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by paris hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.finally, i would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. the use of the "clown" mask sent shivers up my spine. the way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! it completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. you have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of carpenter all rolled into one. i could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead i would rather go watch it again. it is worth the repeat visit many times! overall, i think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight carpenter and the slasher film genre. this singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. the lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of jamie lee curtis is exactly what makes halloween that film above the rest. sure, freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for jason, but michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. what can be better? grade: ***** out of *****

halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. it's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. it is a simple movie told very well. the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... if you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. the cast is all terrific. i wish they had never made sequel after sequel. the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie. she hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!

halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! it is in my opinion, the scariest movie of all time. michael myers is the best boogeyman ever! he was just so terrifying! what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a one note score, yet managed to scare the hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78.it's about a boy michael myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. dr. sam loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes michael as "...pure evil. the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes". michael is on a mission though, to kill his other sister, laurie, played by a new jamie lee curtis. she has to babysit on halloween, while her friends are out partying and of course, we know the rules, they get it! but laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;d halloween pays many homages to psycho, we have another character named sam loomis and jamie lee curis, the daughter of janet leigh. halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights! "they're gonna get you! they're gonna get you!". halloween, the ultimate horror film! 10/10

brutal, emotionless michael myers stabs his sister to death at age six on halloween night in 1963; on october 30, 1978, he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of haddonfield, illinois. he is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist (donald pleasence) who knows just how evil this young man is.it opens with a bang, and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire. it's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were; subtle, and scary. it retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings. how many movies are there, really, that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before? not very many.pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; jamie lee curtis, in her motion picture debut, became a bona fide scream queen after acting in "halloween" as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures, and she is an intended victim worth rooting for.co-writer / director john carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall. with this picture, he and his former collaborator debra hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels, many imitators, and an upcoming "re-imagining".it's very quotable - who could ever forget dr. loomis' (pleasence) speech in which he describes michael myers to the sheriff (charles cyphers, a reliable repertory player in several of carpenter's earlier works)?it's fantastic, and worth seeking out. this is my favorite john carpenter movie of all time.it's not totally infallible - there are script holes, after all - but overall it makes a solid impact.9/10

my personal favorite horror film. from the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is carpenter's masterpiece.halloween night 1963, little michael meyers murders his older sister. all-hallows-eve 1978, michael escapes from smith's grove sanitarium. halloween night, michael has come home to murder again.the story is perfectly simple, michael stalks and kills babysitters. no bells or whistles, just the basics. it's carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.the dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes i have yet to see in film. there is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. that and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. the fear is not in death, but in not knowing.the acting is roundelay good. pj soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), nancy loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) jamie leigh-curtis. her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. and of course there is the perfectly cast donald pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) dr. sam loomis. rest in peace mr. pleasence.if the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. to truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.never the less, i have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. highest reguards.10/10

john carpenter's halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers, who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters.this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise. carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date. get that! halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance's career. a true classic.

halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever! john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller. michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as jason vorhees (friday the 13th), the miner (my bloody valentine), and charlie puckett (the night brings charlie). okay, so i got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre. no longer did a monster have to come from king tut's tomb or from dr. frankenstein's lab. he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia. and on the night he came home...haddonfield, illinois and the viewers would never be the same. there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies. first is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood. many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters. this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.) along with the setting, the movie takes place on halloween!! the scariest night of the year! while most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers. besides the setting, there is some great acting. jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, laurie strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date. however, it is donald pleasance, as dr. sam loomis, who really steals the show. his portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend. however, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film. once you hear it, you will never forget it. i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture. nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of. in halloween, john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers. he always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, i think that is what makes him so terrifying. there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness. if you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find michael, he's not looking for candy on this halloween night..he's looking for blood. finally, michael myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness. his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop. he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life. so,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright. trick or treat!

i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such. i feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. i already own all the friday's so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre, the original nightmare on elm street, jaws, the exorcist, angel heart, the exorcist and halloween. now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween. because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was, i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there. no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. no movie.john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. he showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. what was that shadow? what was that noise upstairs? he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use. i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. but they don't. no one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. and it is just not the same. you can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. it's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. and halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.in 1963 a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. as loomis ( his doctor) says to sheriff brackett, " i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what i saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. " that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. and all he wants here is to kill laurie. no one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( halloween ii continues the story quite well )what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. there is one scene that has to be described. and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul. she goes to the car and tries to open it. only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. she gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. the audience picks up on this but she doesn't. she is too busy thinking about paul. when she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then myers strikes, from the back seat. this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. we know what is happening and annie doesn't. but it's astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween. it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. after all, carpenter followed in hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.halloween personifies everything that scares us. if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then halloween is a film that should be seen. it won't let you down. i enjoy being scared, i don't know why, but i do. but nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( wes craven's final nightmare ). if you enjoy beings scared, then halloween is one that you should see. and if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like urban legend. urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?and just to follow up after seeing zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. this is a classic by definition. zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.

for a low budget project, the film was a success. the story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. eva longoria, who now stars on the tv show "dragnet," is sexier than ever. the locations were ideal for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. although this film has it's share of problems, such as continuity, i must say that i would rent the director's next movie. if your a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's commentary.

if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show "desperate house wives" then you are missing out. eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon. this was eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting. she was 24 when she shot it, and looked hot then. as for this low budget film, it's pretty good for the first time director, who has another soon to be released movie "juarez, mexico" currently playing at many film festivals across the united states. in fact, it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news. what would be nice to see is a "snitch'2" with a higher budget.

ok where do i begin?... this movie changed my life! the plot was seamless. james cahill has out done himself. initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen. however this was before exploring the dvd's many features!!!! oh my god jakes cahill's commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting. he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience.i was so impressed by the other actors. the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway, reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. i am certainly with gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel.i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved, matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school... and possibly the guy playing a retard! all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years! where my oscars at dawn!!!!!!!!!!!

one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote "do you believe in love at first site?".a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture, further catapulting the films flawless integrity. gabby (aka joey) played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography. lol.the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young 'handicapped' kid with the speech impediment.. which i may add was acted to perfection! james cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day. the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic. when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm (cut throat mafia). this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming.personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future. thats if i can find it anywhere, lol!

where would one start a review of the film snitch'd? james cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man. his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking, and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1, and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear.cahill's grasp of effects, both visual and aural is electrifying, the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd, a real gritty like underground thriller. also, kudos to his brilliant use of makeup, such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue! yuck! i feel the world of film is much less from james' passing, his memory will linger on and on and on, reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, snitch'd. his insightful director's commentary released a coke-hit up the nose of any discerning film goer, truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets, captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl.but i ask you, why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap? i'll tell you why, because thats life in santa ana baby, its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices, oh no. there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft, tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children's production of double dragon: the play.the only qualm i have with this film, is that there was never a sequel made. come on steven spielberg, come on george lucas, come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23, how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man, james cahill.he discovered eva longoria you know. oh yeah, that he did.jonah

wow! this is a good movie! the acting wasn't good at all, but if you look at some moments in the film, rewind, and watch it again, it is genius! the man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. wow!i never expected that. then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. i bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. and the genius quotes: ''nice shades, i need a pair'' ''their yours.. if you think you can take them..''.. just brilliant! and the fighting is the best i've seen in a while. look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. what a hit! and in the middle of the film, one guy in a car shot one time, then 3 guys fall, he is really good at aiming. it costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. the end was brilliant, it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. jason peters falls down, and roll over again while he is dead! i can't say with more words how great this movie is!

this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever. ever. but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest. the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless. i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd's at my local pound shop. me and some friends then watched it, admittedly whilst rather drunk. it soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film. instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill's last film. at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered. instead we watched the film right through. at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream, something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours, whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons. we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed, this wasn't a work of abysmal film. this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at. this was a film that anyone can enjoy. this was genius.

this is not a love song.my one word summary of this film would be `excellent'.it probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public  it's afilm that forces you to participate. you observe, think, and question.comparisons could be made with deliverance (topic/theme) andperhaps with the blair witch project for overall filming style.however this film stands unique against both.the cinematography effects (solarisation, freeze frame, blur etc)have been seen before but they are used most effectively in thisfilm to underpin the natural tension of the story.acting is raw, menacing and utterly believable.the real theme of the film is about friendship; the title really givesthe game away. it's probably not the kind of friendship that most ofus have experienced or indeed would want to.it is a love song.

it isn't always easy to explain what a movie is like, but this time i think i've found it. it reminded me of two movies: trainspotting (small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in schotland) and the blair witch project (because of the style of filming).it's about the loyalty between two friends, one of them is coming out of jail, the other one hasn't been caught yet. with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of petrol. as they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. than it all goes wrong. one of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of schotland. the two friends literally have to run for their lives.apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time. ok, that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place: the scottish countryside, but i still find that quite amazing. especially because this isn't actually a bad movie. it's perhaps not the greatest movie ever, but they still can be proud of what they achieved. i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie. i give it a 7/10.

i found this very touching as spike and heaton stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn't a few betrayals along the way. i thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was foreground i think. i had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of heaton. my favourite scene had to be the bit where heaton and spike were stuck in the marsh and spike runs off i generally thought spike wasn't coming back. i have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this i would have probably never seen it. overall i thought this film was pretty good and i would recommend it to any person who is a fan of british made films.

this is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn't exactly give the viewer easy watching. the story about troubled spike and his friend heaton is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining. there are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget, such as when spike inhales the aerosol. however i did not really understand the relationship between spike and heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out. and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much "action". it is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing.

i am currently doing film studies at a.s level and "this is not a love song" is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back-story. if you scratch the surface you will find a thriller-chase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers, after committing a murder:-"sounds quite exiting".however you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre. as it is suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, filled with trust, deceit and betrayal. we are not told about this "love" directly through the film but the events that happen through out, for example the way heaton acts towards spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces.overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be dismissed as "rubbish" just because they are done on a low budget.a good film with an intricate story line, however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters.

i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had. only £300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism involved in the story) i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story, the more sadness you feel. more so towards heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned.this is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again. i think that it's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all.

personally i couldn't get into 'this is not a love song', its a brilliant film and there's a great story line to it, i just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much was left of the film.i love the relationship between spike and heaton, there that close they depend on each other to get along in life. at the same time i wish the relationship was more than what it is. heaton is in love with spike, but spike ibsen't in love with heaton, or he doesn't know how to love him. the acts of betrayal, on both parts, have a big effect on the two men. they are both devastated by the fact that the other ran away and abandoned them, at a time when they truly needed each other for survival.

some have compared this film to deliverance. i believe of mice and men is more appropriate. our leading man, heaton, definitely loves spike. it is irrelevant and immaterial whether that is a sexual love. it is the reason heaton does not leave spike. he needs him. they need each other. as brothers, as family, as their only connection to humanity. the setting, scenario, minimal cast all add up to a fine film. frankly, i did not care what happened to the characters. but, i did care about what the film maker did with them. he did well with them. i spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble of mice and men. the soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.

a suspenseful thriller that bears some resemblance to deliverance as for scenery and setting. there are also some very innovatively shot scenes and good music, although the daftness and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is unfitting to the situation, although this is not a mayor problem. it also poses interesting questions about justness of revenge and limits of friendship.

"this is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the chase genre, which many people think has an underlying meaning. the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal. i believe that heaton is in love with spike, but spike is too naive to see this.i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences. heaton shows great intimacy towards spike. with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spike's name on the top of his letters.one thing i've noticed when looking at external reviews, is that when the film has been slated, the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film, as they haven't even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike. i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven't recognised it, when they use phrases like: "who is heaton? what's he doing with a retard like spike?" this person, however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark. spike shows noticeable signs of having a.d.d, although i don't think this person has realised this, as he seems to be using the word "retard" as a derogatory term.i really enjoyed this film. although it is not for the faint hearted. the film is exceedingly character based, after the shooting until the end there isn't much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes. unless you are used to watching such deep, gritty films, stay well away.

before the regular comments, my main curiosity about this is not a love song is that while there's a running time listed on imdb of 94 minutes, the dvd from wellspring media in the united states runs 88 minutes. any input on this is appreciated!two friends with very rough lives take on the road for an adventure. what they wind up in is just that, with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside. rather than just a big chase, the film is complicated by the the daft and rather childlike spike behaving inappropriately, and clutching his boom box like a teddy bear. some viewers may dislike the story based solely upon the character spike, but without a bit of frustration added to the story, the film would have been too easy. you'll notice the way the more stable character heaton refers to spike as "big man" in contrast to spike's "kid out of control" attitude and behavior. frankly, i too was aggravated by spike's ridiculous actions, especially the spray can sniffing, but in a desperate situation it's apparent someone of his mentality would choose an temporary escape. but, heaton was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well.kenny glenaan as heaton is a marvel, and after a while i quit wondering why in the heck he would want to pick spike up from prison and continue a friendship, due to glenaan's great performance. after all, there are many many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for heaton to just ditch spike and try to save himself. i suppose heaton felt like a protective older brother to spike, and the loyalty between the two is hard to break -- until things get too desperate.while some of the cinematography is indeed artsy, it does offer more flavor to story instead of just shots of the men running through the wilderness. the beautiful landscapes, rain, and vast gray skies offer a somber tone that increases the feel of the tragic circumstances. the score is unusual as well, and the use of public image ltd.'s song "this is not a love song" and as the title of the film is quite smart.overall, it's understandable if you don't care for this is not a love song as it's focused on two contrasting personalities escaping from another man determined to hunt them down (played by a cool, quiet david bradley). it's not big-budget action entertainment. for the rest of us that enjoy seeking out something minimal and dramatic, it's time worthwhile spent, and it does offer some extremely tense moments that have you holding your breath a bit.i'm really enjoying the films coming out of scotland recently, with the likes of this one, dog soldiers, and the devil's tattoo. i'm also a bit thankful for the subtitles offered on this dvd, as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand. frustrating, dark, and often tense, this is not a love song is very tragic yet engrossing storytelling.

here in brazil is very rare to see a good brazilian film, and brant´s new film is exactly one of these jewel. there are some flaws in the film, of course, but they are very minimal. the directing and acting in this film are very good!can´t wait to see another brant´s new film!

the three main characters are very well portrayed, especially anisio by rock musician turned into first time actor paulo miklos. he is extremely convincing as the lower class trespasser/invader. the film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business, the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes. how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition. 9-9,5 out of 10.

ivan (marco ricca) and gilberto (alexandre borges) are partners in a company together with estevão (george freire), but the first ones contract a professional killer, anisio, to murder estevão (the plot, at least at the beginning, doesn't explain very well why). the guy does it and after receiving his money he starts blackmailing the two partners, appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there (as supervisor or something). at the same time he meets marina (mariana ximenes), daughter of estevão, and starts dating with her! in a story like this, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be victimized, exception made to marina, which is the only person who doesn't know what's going on and didn't betray anyone this film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like são paulo, where crime is every day's presence. we can feel irony but also veracity in characters like anisio (brilliantly played by paulo miklos), which does blackmail to the guys who paid him without any scruples, and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed! he really must be a monster to do something like that, but of course i know there're people like him out there, in brazil or any other place it's a very good movie, cruel but truthful, about a sad reality the acting is great and the soundtrack too.

my short comment for this flick is go pick it up. chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller. there is no way the character of miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, wont push your nerves to the edge...2 thumbs up!

extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of são paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in brazilian urbania. for the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the grit of mexican feature "amores perros" with a character not too far off max cady, from both cape fears, although this is not, by any means, a film about a psychopath. two partners (alexandre borges and marco ricca) in a construction company pay hitman anisio (miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. the murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up brazilian society. anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. the look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic brazilian pop band 'titãs'), paulo miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror.i saw the film at the brasília film fest in november 2001. it has since done very well in sundance and berlin. kleber mendonça filho

basically the exact same movie as "house of wax" - vincent price's first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because "the mad magician" offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-d effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! "never change a winning team" is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price's character don gallico, another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him. don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled "the girl and the buzz saw". gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company. the sleazy and relentless ormond, who by the way also ransacked gallico's once beloved wife, takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico's rival the great rinaldi. inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond, but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim's image and even starts leading a double life. "the mad magician" is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in grand guignol style, with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part). the 3-d delights near the beginning of the film, like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains, merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50's hype, but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them. "the mad magician" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era. needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in. like no other actor could ever accomplish, price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way. you pity don gallico, yet at the same time you fear him enormously. you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death. vincent price simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.

the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films, some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time. price's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s, with films such as roger corman's brilliant poe-cycle (still the greatest horror cycle of all-time), michael reeves' "witchfinder general" (1968) or ubaldo ragona's "the last man on earth" (1964) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career. the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is, however date back to the 50s, with "house of wax" (1953) marking his rise to stardom. "the mad magician" of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor. this is not to say, however, that this film isn't an original, delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself. as the lines above may suggest, vincent price is my favorite actor, and, while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in, none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem.price stars as don galico (aka. galico the great), an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices, whose boss, a sleazy businessman, stole his wife (eva gabor) from him. when the boss takes away one of galico's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival, the great rinaldi (john emery), galico snaps, and a murderous spree of revenge begins...don't we love vincent price when he's out for revenge? some of his most famous and greatest films such as "the abominable dr. phibes" (1971) or "theater of blood" (1973) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders, and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does. this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price, who, as always, delivers a brilliant performance, and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan. another must-see for my fellow price fans.

i totally disagree with the other reviews.all basically negative.i took a chance on this movie and was glad that i did.glad indeed.i couldn't find anything wrong with it.nothing period.the script is original.the actors are all likable and convincing.dee smart reminded me of marcia brady from the brady bunch.but this gal truly can act.the setting in the australian outback is perfect.incredible scenery.great soundtrack i.e paul kelly.god bless paul kelly.the cranberries are also here.i have seen this movie twice in less than 24 hrs.i will probably watch it again.it is that interesting.it makes one think.it is(was)probably better than nine-tenths of the so-called hollywood blockbusters that were also out during this time.back of beyond is a likable.well photographed film.i couldn't find anything wrong with it.check it out!my first review!

this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say, "enough already!" of course, it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. eric phillips (don wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to eric to clear her name. wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me. being a pm production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don's simulator. it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa 1995.

vincent price's follow-up to house of wax (1953), the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon, similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman. though a remake, the former (shot in technicolor) remains the superior effort; that said, apart from some resistible comic relief, the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-d showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head?), this offers more than enough grand guignol-type thrills and overall camp value (price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand on its own two feet. incidentally, director brahm's involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles (both starring laird cregar) he had previously helmed i.e. the lodger (1944) and hangover square (1945). the young leads are played by mary murphy (as price's ingénue assistant) and patrick o'neal (as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough, he would himself take the lead in a similar piece, chamber of horrors [1966], which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one). an interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique, fingerprinting, which is crucial in bringing about price's downfall (in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax)though the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run! watching the star in a made-to-measure role, the film emerges a good deal of fun  particularly at a compact 73 minutes.

a pretty memorable movie of the animals-killing-people variety, specifically similar to "willard" in that it stars an aging character actor (in this case, a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne, who puts in the only distinguished performance i've seen him give) in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him. yes, this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable, so that you will cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, locations, etc. couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence.tremayne's character is "snakey bender", and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie: an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souza's music. when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend gets married to a stripper (thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert) he goes on the rampage, in the process creating a memorable pile-up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners. one amusing game you can play while watching "snakes" is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff.all in all, very cheap and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies.

wow, i loved this film. it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch. the tale revolves around this one family from utah and it's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch. the main lead (giovanni ribisi) plays his part very well, at no time does he leave you to believe that he's acting all his feelings. it's his brother (elias koteas) who stole the show for me though. when the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other, giving fantastic performances. great cast, great film.

an interesting tv movie based on true fact, betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters, that of a prisoner. giovanni ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brother's death penalty. but when he goes to visit him and enters elias koteas, the problem starts. it has nothing to do with koteas' acting ability. he just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to "g.q." magazine, with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. this realization came to me after meeting again an old friend, whom i had not seen for almost 15 years, which he spent in several panamanian jails. the young man i used to know is gone, not only because he is older, but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system. there are jails and there are jails, one must say, but this one prisoner in "shot in the heart" is definitely out of this world.

the acting- fantastic. the story- amazing. the script- wonderful.just a few ways to describe this movie. yes, it's slow and it has mostly talking, but the whole story of all of their lives and how it's told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. i, myself, am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie. i'm also to read the exectioner's song, which is the 'other' half of the gilmore story. this movie made me think so much about the phrase "piering into the other side of the looking glass". you hear a song in the movie called gary gilmore's eyes, which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it'd be like to have gary gilmore's eyes(which is one of the things gary gave as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, which is after the last time mikal ever sees gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself. this movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others. i recommend this movie(and the book) very very much.

shot in the heart is wonderful. it brilliantly illustrates the plight of gary gimore, a convicted murder who requested death. shot in the heart shows the ordeal that gilmore's family, torn up by hatred, went through. this movie is an incredible psychological study, and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10

while the original 1932 version, with preston foster, was good, there's no remake more worthy than this 1959 one, or more impossible to find anywhere, just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that. never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant, or a script more thought-provoking, as well as an improvement upon the original. many years after the last of my several viewings of this film, in 1970, i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit he'd made to death row, and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification he'd felt with people in similar circumstances. the article was about as short as the main character here, and didn't cover much, other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized, even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here. . . . . one of my main problems with capital punishment is that, of course, it is not evenly, impartially applied, just as many innocent people are far-too-carelessly, thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate. another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough, or, for that matter, even publicly enough! the bible makes a special point, in such cases, about one of the more important purposes of such, as a deterrent, being ineffectually obscured, minus, not only a public viewing, but also the direct participation of all! as for those who claim to prove, statistically, that such is not an effective deterrent? in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data, i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking. however, i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall, in the apostle, had been punished at all, for his particular "crime," or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a "temporary insanity" defense, as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case. . . . in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit he'd recounted, and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate, i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature. i don't know exactly when he'd become the professing christian he now makes it a special point, whenever possible, to emphasize that he is; but, as anybody should be well-aware, this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood, when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye. however, i have no particular bone of contention concerning that, per se, just as there's no doubt, scripturally speaking, that not all, and perhaps not even most, shall be spared the same ultimate fate, at the hands of the lord himself, as a result of his sacrifice on the cross. however, there is a problem, for me, about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment; for, contrary to the lord himself, who would love to see everybody saved (ezekiel 18:32) (ii peter 3:9), they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn! . . . what most people, on either side of this superlatively ever-burning issue, cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate, is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard. the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged, at least by any strictly human reckoning. yet, regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is, there can be no doubt that anything short of it, or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation, falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth. indeed, i've seen the most blood-curdling thirst for the same come out, self-contradictorily enough, on far-too-many occasions, whenever the categorically anti-death penalty advocates are confronted, even in the most rationally well-balanced ways, with the fact that, although the lord died for everybody, not all are thereby going to be saved. after-all, in order to receive absolution, one must, to repeat the same term, reach out and receive it, that is, repent (luke 13:3-5). could anything make more sense? . . . but, then, what about the lord's command to forgive, even in the case of one's enemies, of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation? one of the far-too-prevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality, as popularly misinterpreted, is the way it obscuringly over-simplifies the real meaning of forgiveness. the act of forgiveness does not, in itself, mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven. when one takes a clearly sober, rationally well-balanced view here, from the perspective of god's own attitude, all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way, seeing the light, and being granted mercy. this attitude is, of course, the very opposite of, say, that of jonah, who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance. jonah didn't want them to repent, but vindictively desired that they be destroyed. how self-righteously, cold-bloodedly like unto most professing christians he was, save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most! i envy jonah almost as much as he would me! however, minus the repentance of the one being forgiven, any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good. in such a case, the only one to benefit is the real christian himself!

having not seen this film in about 20 years i am still impressed with it 's hard -hitting impact and stellar acting. of course, one mr. mickey rooney is indeed, incredible in his role as the ring-leading "killer".(in reference to another review here-none other than orson welles evoked mickey rooney's name as the greatest movie actor,also.) i also recall the jazzy-brassy score and the bare black and white photography. i love the mick's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning.(i think the stranglers lifted it for a line in one of their songs-get a grip on yourself.)this is a great film and unjustly buried film. let's get it out ! side note-a recent film review magazine gave a big write up on don segal's "babyface nelson" ,made a couple years before "last mile" and also starring mickey rooney. another rave of the mick's intense and sympathetic performance.perhaps it's the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances.

saw this movie when it came out in 1959, left a lasting impression. great group of actors. a little short timewise but a great movie all the same. have only seen once since then and that was some time ago. hopefully they'll put it out on dvd if they haven't already.

this is a very grim, hard hitting, even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry. it's black and white photography keeps it from being dated. mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted, yet strangely sympathetic lead. one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row. it is also quite poignant.

i have seen this movie many times. at least a dozen. but unfortunatly not recently. however, etched in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which mickey rooney, -"killer mears" knows that he is to be executed and it's getting close to the moment of truth, he dances, and cries, and laughs, he vacillates from hesteria to euphoria and runs the gambit of ever emotion. never have i seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead, past or present. it was then i know for sure that mickey rooney, yes, "andy hardy" was and is a actor of great genius. however i kept it, my opinion to myself for years thinking, surely i must be alone in this viewpoint. about 15 years or so after i saw this film for the last time on television, i chanced to read the old q & a section of the los angeles times. the question was posed to lawrence olivier, and the question was: "mr. olivier you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, whom then do you consider to be among the greatest actors?" his answer was, "peter finch and mickey rooney" i was stunned, but not surprised. i immediatly flashed back to his "killer mears" and i felt very good for having seen this great ability in him, and now having my view supported by another whos work i admired.. later of course there was "bill" and many other great moments with mikey rooney. this film, "the last mile" should be seen by all acting students. i frankly cannot remember a great deal about the film after all these years but mr. rooney in it, will never leave me. if anyone out there remembers this film the same as i do? i would be interested in hearing from you. for this picture etched in my heart alone i gave it a 10 just on the face of his performance.

the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician. however, mid-way through the very successful show, the police come and shut him down. it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created--even those he made on his own time at home. as a result, price justifiably kills the evil man. the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing, because price was a bit mad, he just couldn't stop at one (sort of like eating lay's potato chips).the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great plot twists as well as exciting action. one thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull. while it's also far from subtle, it is fun throughout, though and well worth a look.had i never seen vincent price's version of house of wax, i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9. that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film, it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it (house of wax). the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful, the formula was re-hashed in the follow-up film. both were made in 3-d, both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch. the biggest differences, and there are few, are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery.my advice is to see this film and house of wax (the price version only). they are both terrific 1950s horror films.

even though it has one of the standard "revenge price plots," this film is my favorite of vincent price's work. gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters- likeability. when you watch it, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance, even though he frightens you a little with his original fury. as the film goes on, his character becomes tragic. he's committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover that up. and again to cover that one up. and again... your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral- like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. even if the revenge story is of old, the plot devices themselves are original- gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. a shame this one isn't available for home veiwing.

eye in the labyrinth is not your average giallo...and to be honest, i'm not really sure that it really is a giallo; but giallo or not, despite some problems, this is certainly a very interesting little film. i'm hesitant to call it a giallo because the film doesn't feature most of the things that make these films what they are; but many genre entries break the mould, and this would seem to be one of them. the film doesn't feature any brutal murders as many giallo's do, but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration. the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie, his patient who, for some reason, she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her. we then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people, but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before julie's arrival...the film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth. this never really comes off, and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point (if any) the film is trying to make. eye in the labyrinth is directed by mario caiano, the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier. he doesn't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one; but the surreal aspects of the story come off well, and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring. the film stars rosemary dexter, who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance. most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning, with the exceptions of adolfo celi, who is good as the villain of the piece and alida valli, whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks. the film does explain itself at the end; which is lucky as i'm sure i'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then! overall, this may not be classic stuff; but its good enough and worth seeing.

this little seen movie is a languid and laid-back giallo. it veers away from some of the cliché's of the genre and adopts a looser approach. it's about a woman searching for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason. her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals. in true giallo style, murder is never far away.the cast is really rather good. we have aldofo celi (thunderball), alida valli (suspiria), horst frank (cat o' nine tails) and a very young sybil danning (80's scream queen). the lead actress is rosemary dexter, and while i am not familiar with her, she does a good job in leading the picture.one of the defining features of eye in the labyrinth is its music. atypically for a giallo it features a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack. this score, composed by roberto nicolosi, is reminiscent of miles davis, especially his work on in a silent way. it's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli. the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny, sea-front scenery that the film is mostly made up of.this is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set-pieces. well, this film falls a little short in this regard. it's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between. the opening dream-murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence. but this really isn't a particularly violent film. still, i don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre. the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters (the idiot boy saro and that unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent?) and moments of the bizarre to satisfy; while the sleaze-factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout.eye in the labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery, as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa, all under suspicion of murder; we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the (highly unsympathetic) murder victim. while this isn't a grade-a example of the genre, it's certainly an appealingly different one, as it doesn't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub-genre. for giallo enthusiasts i give this a thumbs up and hope one day it's given a nice dvd transfer. it certainly deserves the treatment.

giallo fans, seek out this rare film. it is well written, and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films. i don't want to give anything away, so i wont even say anything about the plot. the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect. recommended! the only place i've seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema, for $15.

when i saw it for the first time i was really impressed.the director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it first.but..the main point was not conflict but..friendship!older and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life.it is amazing. every time i watch it i enjoy!of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable. thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger! amazing film!i advice everyone to see it.i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time.

this is the best movie i`ve ever seen !!! thomas beckett & richard miller -two mankinds who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madnes, one shot - one killed !!? you must kill, if you getting doubt about something, you must survive !!p.p.- i appologise of my bad / worst/ english !!!

i am curious of what rifle beckett was using in the movie, and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing. if this is loosely based on carlos hathcock's sniping, i am guessing that it is a 7mm. round. i am also curious of the rifle itself. he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle that the vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father. beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. i would like to know which rifle that is also. i know that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand. i just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it.as for mr. hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills. after his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the usmc the skills that they would need in the field. his sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the usmc. i found out his name from my friend who is a former marine. any information would be great.

this was another great tom berenger movie.. but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome.. tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama! billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end! sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it.. i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick.. i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent!

this is one military drama i like a lot! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett. this marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. there you have billy zane("the phantom" and others) who plays richard miller, a former swat form d.c., works for the government and takes orders only from them. who needs a bureaucrat? i don't! when these two are paired, sparks should be flying. and how. however, beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. when the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. and when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him. who needs politics when you a pro like beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. the movie was a direct hit. watch it. rating 4 out of 5 stars.

just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt. barnes, he has done it again with thomas beckett. if i thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes, it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes. great movie, even for a girl.

zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. i don't typically go for military/war movies, but this was worth my time.it was serious, but it was also humorous. beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest. no matter what, you know that he's got your back.zane's character developed throughout the film. he wasn't just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun.the ending through me a little though. it didn't really go with the action throughout the film, but i'm glad that i saw it, nonetheless.it's worth checking out.

there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism. if you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war, take a look at this one. i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle, no-one quite sure where that shot came?and, they nicked one scene to saving private ryan, so it has to have some merit in the scene.

sunday would not be sunday without an action movie, and when you want intense combat, you turn to tom berenger (platoon).here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords. life's a bitch, so he gets a green office type (billy zane) to help on the mission.the film is in the hands of luis llosa, who stunk up anaconda. he doesn't do much better here, but berenger makes the movie worthwhile.sure, it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but is is good, tense action when the time is right.

some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. however, i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one.the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. tomas beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. however, after beccket showed his day dream of montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-hearted.millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart"(as what beccket said). what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. these two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one.

"one shot, one kill, no exceptions." a must see if you are into marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! great overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details, and more. pretty close to the real thing. but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults. this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins. the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think. its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action. sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie. tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life. the plain of dealing with all of the death. must see for sniper fans.

two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets; a slimy south american drug-lord and a prominent general.moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere, sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller, taking it's time, establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. director llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. but this film is far better than his stallone/stone travesty the specialist.billy zane, usually incredibly tiresome, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger. as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture. he can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here, reprising the role twice more in direct to dvd sequels.

sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies. i remember movies about vietnam or wwii, lots of firing, everybody dies, bam bam. "sniper" takes war to a new level or refinement. the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for - the helplessness of humans in the jungle, the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller, and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger. a seemingly low-budget film makes up for every flaw with action, suspense, and thrill, because when it comes down to it, it's just one shot, one kill.

this will be somewhat short. first, don't listen to the critics, as it is not as bad as most say it is!! sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie. while sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper. and yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie doesn't? there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger. i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine's bar scene. the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it!! also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope. and yes, the sniper motto is `one shot, one kill'. judge sniper for yourself!!

despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages, it's still worth a look as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the panamanian jungle.peruvian director luis llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in panama. the film has some good moments as beckett, the veteran marine, takes a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country. the only problem, miller, has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve.miller, the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the guerrilla warfare between the military and drug lords against the infiltrated american intelligence men, learns a valuable lesson from beckett. what looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle.tom berenger, is an actor who doesn't register much, as he proves in this movie, but in the context of the movie, he is right as a man of a few words. billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until the crucial end.for lovers of action film, "sniper" offers an 112 minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a more satisfying movie.

****spoilers**** the film "sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos "gunny" hathcock. the unassuming soft-spoken mister rogers look-alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in "nam".which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is.tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgt.thomas beckett who's at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless. since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit-man. backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country.the story of the film "sniper" is focused on sgt.beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller, billy zane, being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle. the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze, frederick miraglittoa, and colombian drug king-pin raul ochoa, carlos alveraze, who's supporting him in a planned a military take-over of the country. we see earlier in the movie sgt. beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in "sniper". for it shows step by step how sgt. beckett with the help of his spotter cpt. papich, aden young, does his job. there's also a sub-plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva, eward wiley, who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter. you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt. beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait.what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo-like ending with sgt. beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog."sniper" is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies: a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy.

i've heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull. i don't think they were watching the right movie. this isn't the prototypical action movie, thank god.this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people. in this way it works extremely well, with terrific performances from berenger and zane (who doesn't sleepwalk through the movie like he has in other roles - he actually looks like he's acting).i was disappointed with the action towards the end - a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie. but watch zane's face as he panics, alone, while berenger does the dirty work.

main theme in this dirty harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold. sandra locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful. locke is an "8" normally, but, with a deadly pistol in her purse, "cocked" for the bad guys, she climbs all the way up the scale to a "10". having been gang-raped, along with her younger sister, some years ago, locke, as jennifer spencer, has tried to block out the attack from her life, as best she can. her sister, tho, is almost comatose as a result of the trauma, so the memory is never far from her mind. one day, jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in s.f.; she buys a pistol, follows him to a bar, lets him pick her up, then when they're alone in his cadillac, beginning to make love, she shoots him....once in the genitals, once in the brain - - this in the opening scene!! ya gotta love this spunky lady. she's got her priorities straight. plus, jennifer is a professional artist, putting all her anger on canvas until now. after executing her first perp, jennifer curiously watches det. insp. harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy. then, she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street, visits her sister in a nursing home, then goes a'hunting in san paolo, ca "up the coast" where the rape event took place years ago. with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind, our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall, as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist. not uncommon to us right- wingers, when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal, don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity, we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted. such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals, once in the brain. throughout the movie, scenes of jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good, il' dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop, remember "go ahead. make my day."? later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid (who'd just insulted callahan) in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog- s**t....leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say "i want to have your baby." my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action, when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel. michael grazzo (pantangeli in godfather ii) does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don, even if he's only in one scene, dying in a most-convincing manner. however, harry's troubles aren't over with yet! the elevator punk's gang and threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close-ordered scenes, and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly. yup, some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence....looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie. but, there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets. the punk kids die much more creatively, though, as they both burn to death and drown in s.f. bay. warms my heart. with so much violent intent directed at insp. callahan, his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the "22 caliber vasectomy killing" as jennifer spencer's crime is now known, but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals. love that harry. while our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo, two more murders happen, same m.o., on a sleazy, lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur. then harry meets jennifer! they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order, making the guilty pay, etc. could a hot, love scene be in the offing soon? we're led to believe just that. characters abound in this real-man meets real-woman crime drama, and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named raye parkins who's both irritating and entertaining. raye set up jennifer's rape for her "boyfriend" years before, and she'll get hers eventually. the san paolo police chief, played by reliable eastwood co-star pat hingle (the hanging judge in 'hang em high'), is strangely at odds with callahan's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies, until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists. much like jennifer's sister, chief janning's son is now a comatose adult, but driven mad by guilt. it can't end here, though. the dyke's rapist boyfriend, mick, now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal, drives in from vegas becuz raye's dropped a dime on jennifer, summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions. mick sleeps at raye's house, but his timing is all wrong, and he's arrested before he can spend more time with raye, mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer's revolver. psycho mick makes bail at long last, with jennifer gunning for him. a desperate chase ensues, as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other. it all turns out well in the end, with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song.

despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best dirty harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early '80's. it's also a kickass action movie.opening with a liberal, female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous, "go ahead, make my day" line), "sudden impact" is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. it gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the '80's.

sudden impact is the best of the five dirty harry movies. they don't come any leaner and meaner than this as harry romps through a series of violent clashes, with the bad guys getting their just desserts. which is just the way i like it. great story too and ably directed by clint himself. excellent entertainment.

i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie. its got a pretty good plot, some good action, and the change of location for harry does not hurt either. sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that. eastwood is in good form as dirty harry, and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop. if you liked dirty harry, then you should see this one, its a lot better than the dead pool. 4/5

****excellent***good**fair*poor`go ahead, make my day!' the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself (who was rumored of directing most of magnum force) and he brings back the violent society from the first two films. however, the film still lacks impact and believability. this film was released in the early `80s, the time of regan and the young republicans. the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame. this plot would have been better for the enforcer, which actually would have made it a good movie. what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle. rating: 3 stars

dirty harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them. probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has...anyway..... an action-packed story set again in san francisco and santa cruz. the chief rapist, played by andy drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end (of course!). not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original dirty harry.

after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer(1976) to be the final chapter in the series. dirty harry is back, older, more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic.dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer, vigilante cops, and vietnam veteran terrorists. but now he's after a new killer, a killer who wants payback, by gunning down her attackers.sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry. callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman(played by sondra locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who is left traumitized. ten years after, she's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers. at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack, of which the mob are hunting him as well. so in order to let the heat die down within the city, harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town, but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well, while hunting her attackers one by one. harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar, as he homes in on the killer's trails.sudden impact in my opinion, has to be one of my top 10 revenge films, as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet, far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined. sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had, a dark tone with entertaining value.so do you feel lucky, punk?

clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this, but this one does not embarrass him. dirty harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance, there is no reason why you won't like him. he is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thinking, is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care.from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts, the character of the lead role always captivates the audience. in white hunter black heart, he is the crazy director, in "in the line of fire" he is the "old 'un" while here is the "almost" jobless with his job, that is to say he makes work for himself, doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation.based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all the "no non-sense" movie watchers. the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot. however, what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not, as it is far too obvious from the beginning. it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving. also, there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry.

sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director. the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film. one might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution. for me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. however, in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. forget the "go ahead punk, make my day scene", that's iconic but not original. but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director. and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. also, i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed. although eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see play misty for me, breezy etc.) thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.

this was without a doubt the best of the "dirty harry" series. from the opening credits, you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing. sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. eastwood has many "aside" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show harry at his bad-assed best. loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks. this is the one dirty harry flick that's raw and devoid of any "fluff". i can watch this again and again (okay, not in one sitting) because it's a gratifying "out for revenge" yarn. the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable. "go ahead - make my day...you feel lucky, punk? ...." classic eastwood as only eastwood, with his anguished, rubbery expressions, and whispery, menacing voice can do it.

when this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline "dirty harry is at it again". whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it's complete and total accuracy. "sudden impact" retains all the aspects that made the previous three dirty harry movies so successful- tight pacing, a compelling plot, strong supporting characters, endless gunplay, and bone-dry humor. some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest, bloodiest, and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise.the plot is somewhat intriguing: after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums, inspector callahan is sent on a forced "vacation" by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of san paolo. he is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his (no doubt considerable) misery by a second shot to the head. early on in the film, the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named jennifer spencer (sondra locke) who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier. this incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback, snippets of which recur before each new murder. as more bodies start to appear with the same m.o, it becomes clear to harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest (guess who?) know more than they are telling. to make matters even more complicated, the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard."sudden impact" offers relentless action from beginning to end. clint eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax. sondra locke's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character. that having been said, it is fair to wonder if another actress (who was not eastwood's off-screen companion at the time) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- theresa russell and cybill shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates. members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include albert popwell as harry's partner horace, paul drake as the psychopathic mick, and the truly scene-stealing audrie j. neenan who portrays the vicious ray parkins. however the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots (the animosity between harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums, a mob vendetta against him) take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story. their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels. in the first half of the film it sometimes appears that dirty harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom. however the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between callahan, spencer, and her former tormentors assumes prominence. this second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given "sudden impact" the potential to be a first-class, neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough .44 magnum heroics to satisfy the harry loyalists. instead we get the film that eastwood and warner bros. clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it's intended audience. this was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why. though not the film that it could have been, this is still big, trigger-happy fun. even after repeated viewings, it's going to make your day.

sudden impact was overall better than the enforcer in my opinion. it was building up to be a great movie, but then i saw the villain(s) and was disappointed.sudden impact was different than the previous installments. the plot went a different direction in this movie, as dirty harry doesn't take as much of a police approach this time around. we also don't see the villain(s) until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for us all.clint eastwood once again steals the show as dirty harry, enough said. pat hingle was enjoyable as chief jannings, harry's new assigned boss. bradford dillman seemed to change his name to captain briggs here, either way, he wasn't any different. michael currie is decent as lt. donnelly, harry's annoying superior. i personally enjoyed kevyn major howard as hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against harry. albert popwell was excellent as horace, harry's buddy. audrie j. neenan was good as ray parkins, a famous lesbian around town. jack thibeau was well cast as kruger, a pervert. now for the really bad part. sandra locke, eastwood's long-time lover was horribly miscast as jennifer spencer, harry's love interest. and paul drake was just horrible as mick.the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts.8/10.

in don siegel's 1971 masterpiece "dirty harry", clint eastwood epitomized the super-tough, super-cool unorthodox, no-nonsense cinema-cop with his role of the eponymous inspector 'dirty' harry callahan. two sequels followed, the first of which, "magnum force", tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences. the second sequel, "the enforcer" was grittier again, and was promoted as "the dirtiest harry of them all". this title, however, truly belongs to the fourth film in the series, clint eastwood's own "sudden impact", which is doubtlessly the grittiest, nastiest, most violent and downright dirtiest of all harry films, and, in my humble opinion, the second-best after the masterpiece original.***warning! spoilers ahead!*** in a small town near san francisco, a mysterious sexy lady (sondra locke) lures men into being alone with her. what these men don't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim, longing for bloody revenge. as fate wants it, san francisco's toughest cop, inspector dirty harry callahan, who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors, spends his leisure time in this exact little town... "sudden impact" is the dirtiest callahan film in several aspects. the film is extremely gritty and graphically violent. harry callahan himself is dirtier than ever. not afraid to make use of his 44. magnum in order to stop trouble, harry treats 'punks' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge-murders are justified in his opinion. clint eastwood is, as always, brilliant in the role of harry callahan. eastwood epitomized coolness and bad-assery as the "man with no name" in sergio leone's dollar trilogy, and he did so again in the dirty harry films. "sudden impact" gives us the dirtiest harry we have ever seen. eastwood's real-life girlfriend sondra locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty. the great pat hingle, who had already worked with eastwood in ted post's tough-minded western "hang 'em high" in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town. the film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters, including a pathetic criminal played by kevin major howard (best known for his role in stanley kubrick's "full metal jacket") and a woman named ray perkins (audrie j. neenan), doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema. albert popwell, who played the bank robber in the famous "do you feel lucky?" scene in "dirty harry" and the black militant leader in "the enforcer" is also part of this one again, this time as harry's colleague and buddy. overall "sudden impact" is the grittiest, dirtiest and probably the most violent of all "dirty harry" films, (though "the dead pool" isn't exactly tame either), and my second-favorite after the brilliant 1971 original. an absolute must-see for callahan fans, and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad-assery. my rating: 8.5/10

clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series. clint is older but he's still got it, harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where the memorable "make my day" catchphrase comes from!) but the city he took a vacation was worse, a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one. the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie! an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. clint eastwood's sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator. worth a watch if you like clint eastwood, the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers.

sudden impact is a two pronged story. harry is targeted by the mob who want to kill him and harry is very glad to return the favour and show them how it's done. this little war puts harry on suspension which he doesn't care about but he goes away on a little vacation. now the second part of the story. someone is killing some punks and harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet. the police chief is not a subtle man and he warns harry to not get involved or cause any trouble. this is harry callahan trouble follows him. the mob tracks him to this town and hell opens up as harry goes to war. meanwhile the vigilante strikes again and the gang having figured it out is ready for her. jennifer spencer is caught and harry comes to her rescue during the film's climax. sudden impact is not the greatest dirty harry but at the time it gives us a harry that is very much an anti hero ready to go to war just to pursue justice. again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line. go ahead make your day.

i liked nearly all the movies in the dirty harry series with the exception of the one i think is titled "enforcer". "deadpool" was a bit weak in areas too, but i still enjoyed it. this one is one of my favorites of the series, if nothing else for the great line of "go ahead, make my day". this one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong. just think "magnum force" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park. it also features dirty harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up sandra locke in a rather humorous scene. the only question that remains is why clint eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress sandra locke in so many of his movies. she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me. granted she is not to bad here, but her character could have been so much better by someone else. another problem with this movie and other dirty harry movies, at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns. i like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds? still, very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies.

clint eastwood would star again as the battle-weary detective harry callahan, but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'dirty harry' series. 'sudden impact' again like the other additions, brings its own distinguishable style and tone, but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments (and bestowing a classic line "go ahead. make my day") but some of its humor has to been seen to believe. a bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts. oh yeah. however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco.the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes. after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood. he's ordered to take leave, but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town san paulo, where a murder has occurred similar in vein (bullet to groin and between eyes) to his case. there he begins to dig up dirt, which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge.to be honest, i wasn't all that crash hot on eastwood's take, but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'magnum force'. this well-assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon (even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time), quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging. it's like he's experimenting with noir-thriller touches with character-driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework. his use of images is lasting, due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics. dark tones, brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure (harry with his new .44 automag handgun) moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks. it's a striking sight that builds fear! mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor. it seemed to come off. a major plus with these films are the dialogues, while i wouldn't call 'sudden impact' first-rate, it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines "you're a legend in your own mind". don't you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip, before pulling out his piece. the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages. lalo schfrin would return as composer (after 'the enforcer" had jerry fielding scoring) bringing a methodical funky kick, which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get-go. bruce surtees (an eastwood regular) gets the job behind the camera (where he did a piecing job with 'dirty harry') and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes, but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments.eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch, going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan. this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry's quest for justice by the badge even though he doesn't always agree with it. i just found it odd a real change of heart. across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time sondra locke. her turn of traumatic torment (being senselessly raped along with her younger sister), is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity. when the anger is released, it's tactically accurate in its outcome. paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and audrie j. neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big-mouthed performance. these people are truly an ugly bunch of saps. pat hingle is sturdy as the chief of the small coastal town. in smaller parts are bradford dillman and the agreeably potent albert popwell (a regular in the series 1-4, but under different characters). how can you forget him in 'dirty harry' yes he is bank robber that's at the end of the trademark quote "do i feel lucky? well, do ya, punk?"

clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante (sondra locke)who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk, not that i'm complaining. sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment.

having never seen the original dirty harry, i judged this movie on a clean slate. and i must say, i quite enjoyed it. sure, some of the acting by sondre locke made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was the 80's. but even if you can't get past her (and i almost couldn't) or her revenge killings (which seemed a little.. overdone ;p), it's worth it just for dirty harry. or at the very least, the bull dog he affectionately names 'meathead' :p7/10.

director/star clint eastwood's "sudden impact" is an intriguing addition to the "dirty harry" series - a combination of crude film-making and genius. it's mediocre and silly in parts, brilliant and classic in others, with compelling, gripping pacing. there are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up "make my day" scene recalls the "do you feel lucky" one, one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's scorpio, an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry's partner - just to name a few.harry callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department, still mean, still tough, but now he's older and wearier. his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice, the two things not always being compatible. this "incompatibility" is the underlying theme of the series. the first film posed a simple question, "what about the victim's rights?" - (do they outweigh those of the criminal? vice versa? depends?). that film's answer was controversial, prompting a sequel (the highly enjoyable "magnum force") which set out to draw the line between harry's brand of justice and pure, heartless vigilantism. dirty harry, like many of clint's other roles, is the personification of vengeance, the protector of the the defenseless. this movie however brings it back to the victim, in this case jennifer (portrayed by sondra locke), who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men (and one woman) who committed the crime.without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie, i will say this - i mentioned earlier that "sudden impact" echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series (the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example - an intentional prank, i believe). the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante? and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights? the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series, one which i personally (as a fan) found quite moving. that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the "dirty harry" collection, the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film. (not to knock "the dead pool" - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan, rather than a character-defining film like this one).this movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing, and the president himself frequently quoted "go ahead, make my day."

anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying. there weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society. the popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby, lily-livered, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of "political correctness". the performances across the board were compelling. i sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. in particular, i found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films i've seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. the lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that dirty harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end. this was the only sequel in the dirty harry saga that equaled the first.

inspector "dirty" harry callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco. however, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary "go ahead, make my day" line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. very badass and it just what fans can expect from him. however, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. the problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as harry is. this really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, magnum force.on the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. however, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different, it is a good movie for fans. --- 7/10rated r for violence and a rape scene

it's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly (if only in comparison to other films in its legacy), and others in a 'sub-plot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong. sudden impact is one of those cases, where clint eastwood as star/producer/director shows when he can be at his best, or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime/mystery/detective story in his dirty harry fame. we get that 'make my day' line, and un-like in the first film where his 'do i feel lucky' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails, here it's switched around. he gets into another shamble with the department, as usual, when he tries to fight crime 'his' way, in particular with a diner robbery (inspiration for pulp fiction?) and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus. he's told to 'take a vacation', and that's the last thing on his mind. this whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines, which just adds to the frustration. but soon his story merges with the sub-plot that eastwood develops from the start.enter sandra locke's character, jennifer spencer, whom we soon learn after some (appropriately) mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel, unjust sexual assault (err, outright rape), and is sleekly, undercover-like, getting revenge. her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film, the most intense, and finally when it goes into callahan's storyline (he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder), the film finally finds a focus between eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs. evil (though sometimes blurred, to be sure). eastwood films the flashbacks, not to say too much about them, expertly, in a fresh, experimental style; the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others. it almost seems like a couple of times an art-house sensibility has crept into eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style, which helps make the film watchable.it's a shame, though, that in the end it goes more for the expectable (or maybe not expectable) points, and until the third act callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual 'it's smith...wesson...and me' shtick. however, with locke he gets out of her a very good performance (more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet) and an exciting climax at an amusement park. in a way i do and don't agree with ebert's remark that it's like a 'music video' in eastwood's style here. i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both, the directness, but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video. it's cheesy, it's hard-edged, it's not up to par with the first two 'harry' pictures, but hey, there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the .44.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** after two so-so outings ("magnum force" and "the enforcer"), dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in "sudden impact," a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of clint eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes.for once, the case takes harry outside his native san francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask questions later" tactics), to the hamlet of san paulo. there, (warning: potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered, one at a time, by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack.the killer is portrayed by sondra locke, and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. locke's cold eyes and frosty voice, when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit.the rapists are a despicable lot, especially the leader, who has "psycho nutjob" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate. the flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are nightmarish enough, and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants.some will dismiss "sudden impact" as trash: a mindless, manipulative revenge tale. on a certain level this is true, but it's well-done trash. what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. what we have here is an action movie with a point of view.you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry (a realization that, wisely, is not spelled out with dialogue), he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate. this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare.the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction. this is, after all, a dirty harry movie, and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. the movie is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff. some of the best "harry moments" in the entire series are here, including harry's best-known line, "go ahead -- make my day.""sudden impact" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. it is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told. and it is certainly never dull. on those criteria, it succeeds tremendously.

with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars, but produces and directs as well, you know it's got to be good. although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series, i completely disagree. in my opinion, apart from the original dirty harry, sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series. although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences, it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do. this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good, and it's got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good. in diry harry it's "..well do ya, punk?"; in magnum force "a man's got to know his limitations" ; and in this it's "go ahead. make my day." also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery, as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series. with great acting by clint eastwood and co-star sandra locke, and good directing by clint, this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever.

with harry callahan getting up in years, the inevitable `old man with a chip on his shoulder' story had to come into play eventually. callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, his demeanor still was unwavering. thankfully, this film took some time off to develop a different type of story, one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre. while the film fell short in doing so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music.

the dirty harry series began with very gritty cop action, and was almost immediately lightened up for "magnum force". by the time that "the enforcer" rolled around, dirty harry was little more than a television cop show (saved only by tyne daly). after a break of seven years, dirty harry has finally gone back to his roots. maybe he's been gone for too long this time.clint eastwood makes the first well-directed harry film since don siegel made the first, which helps considerably. harry is a darker character once again, not the nice cop he had become. he can once again say things like "go ahead, make my day" and really mean it. "sudden impact" is a true dirty harry sequel. "the enforcer" should never have been made.7.2 out of 10

the fourth in the "dirty harry" series, this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikable, profane, disgusting females i have ever seen on film: "ray perkins," played by audrie neenan. she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 "detour" character, "ann savage."her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up....and least some of her! then i could enjoy the rest of the movie.everywhere "harry callahan" (clint eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows.....within minutes! it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving, entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one.this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts.....and connects, sad to say. most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end, and who does it better than dirty harry?

sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next. thus, sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan. this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation. harry's always on the job it seems. clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80's, sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that characterizes the first three films. this doesn't mean that it's quality is any less. bottom line: brimming with intensity and action, sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series.

the vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts. it is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan (as played by clint eastwood) so popular. he carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing. but it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen. and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `sudden impact,' directed by and starring eastwood, so successful. in this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception: whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.in his own inimitable way, inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time. so he does; as only `dirty harry' can. in a small town north of san francisco, harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m.o. employed by the perpetrator. unaccountably, harry encounters resistance from the local police chief, jannings (pat hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere. not one to be deterred, however, harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, jennifer spencer (sondra locke). gradually, harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture?eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `dirty harry.' it had been seven years since the last `harry' offering (`the enforcer,' 1976), but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor. and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4. as with all the films he directs, eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end. the screenplay, by joseph stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `dirty harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by charles b. pierce and earl e. smith) is the most engaging since the original `dirty harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action. the characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of harry's best catch-phrases: `go, ahead-- make my day...'as harry, clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular: he lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today. harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before. no matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry, or at least have him around. `dirty harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, eastwood `is' dirty harry, without question, just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone, sherlock holmes.sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.' she manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre. even amid the violence, locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life. her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwood's harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.in supporting roles, two performances stand out: paul drake, as mick, creates the best `psycho' since andy robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `dirty harry.' with actually very limited screen time, drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience. this is the guy you can't wait to see harry take care of in the end. also effective is audrie j. neenan, who makes her character, ray parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city. it's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.the supporting cast includes albert popwell (horace), mark kevloun (bennett) and nancy parsons (mrs. kruger). with a perfect blend of drama and action, `sudden impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience. 9/10.

we're talking about a low budget film, and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses (no spoilers: one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic); but in general the story keeps you interested, most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations. i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot ... i applaud this one on that. if you know what i mean, try to see also "nueve reinas" (nine queens) a film from argentina.

an interesting thriller that has paul winfield as a detective on the case of a murder. paul winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease, it was hard to tell the man was even acting. maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice/narrator of "city confidential", winfield ends his career with a so-so movie; but as always, winfield shines. a treat to watch.erika eliniak is well, erika eliniak, nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department. though, to be fair, this is one of her better efforts.bottom line: a watchable thriller that shouldn't be missed by any paul winfield fan. a decent telefilm to help send paul winfield off to celluloid heaven. what an actor. he will be missed.

it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it. i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing, but an ordinary sex-drama so.... it's a pscyho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it seems. it features emmanuelle seigner, no stranger to the genre (and to nudity) in which her husband, polanski, had directed her. and a creepy performance (did i say creepy/yes creepy) from toreton (bernard tavernier's actor). it looks like a pascal bruckner meets roman polanski (better than bitter moon), like a chabrol gone astray or clouzot thriller (i have seen someone mentioning les diaboliques), but closer to georges franju's les yeux sans visage (eyes without a face, the godfather of dr. phibes and more). a gem ! i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with nighwatch and the vanishing.

this is a quite slow paced movie, slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. the viewer slowly feels that there's something wrong here ...i really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end. it is clever, well paced and very well acted. both philippe toretton and emmannuelle seigner are deeply into their characters. the little son "pierrot" is also very touching.a thriller which does not seem like one. a very unconventional movie, very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes.i'll give it a 8/10 !!

a family (mother-patricia clarkson, father-jake weber, son-erik per sullivan) go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter. they accidentally hit a deer while driving there. this angers some of the locals--especially otis (john speredakos) and things slowly (very slowly) go wrong.i was expecting the worst when i started watching this. the bulk of the reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative. well...i disagree. first off it's not a horror film. the horror doesn't even begin until the closing 30 minutes. it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in. on that level, it's pretty damn good.first--the bad stuff: the pace is way too slow; jake weber is a horrible actor; way too many false dream sequence scares; the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable.the good stuff: pretty good dramatic script; clarkson is excellent as the mother; some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary; a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber (which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot!); pretty good acting by sullivan (only 10 at the time!) and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending.i think many people are annoyed with this film because it's being pushed as a horror film--which it isn't. so, if you can ignore that, i think you might like it. i'm giving it a 7.

if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say. importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here, but not flatly on the surface. you could technically call it a "monster movie" even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end, and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast. some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores, though in fact the less you see of the creature, the better. fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out.

this movie is excellent. i found it very interesting. i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool. the acting was also great, as well as the costumes, production, photography, directing and script. a very happy family, on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer. a huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer's antler's is broken. he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them. see this movie. it's worth it. kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. two thumbs way up!

wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes. the acting is good, the characters act like a normal family. the wendigo effects are good, the deer form reminded me a little of the rabbit in donnie darko.the film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer, a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named otis starts to argue with the dad george, after the car is lifted they drive off to the house. the son miles is a little shook up about the deer but his parents try to tell him that it's natural for things like that to happen. that night while he's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom, the next day they go into to town and miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the wendigo, when miles shows kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there. once returning home george takes his son sledding and while there sledding he's knocked off the board and miles is chases by the wind, after gaining conciseness they go looking for george, they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot, in the hospital kim tells the sheriff that otis may have shot him, the shrieff goes to otis's place where he's bashed over the head with a hammer, as otis drives down the road he finds that the wendigo is after him.wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments. check this out. 10/10

now this is what i'm talking about. finally, a low-budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage. wendigo, while occasionally flawed, is a triumph of the imagination. granted, it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness, but it's still a damn sight better than 99% of direct to video dross.the story is pretty simple: a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter. but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo. is it real? is it all in the boy's imagination? is it an externalization of the child's emotional state? some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it's left to you to decide. don't be put off by such petty nonsense. a film that makes you think is not one to avoid. it's one to rejoice in.

a haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude. keep your freddys and your jasons -- this film is in the same company as "the haunting" (the original). lyrical and truthful, it stays with you long into the night, much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows. a smart rent.

if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say. importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here, but not flatly on the surface. you could technically call it a "monster movie" even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end, and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast. some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores, though in fact the less you see of the creature, the better. fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out.

this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them, and how they (and we) use myth to make sense of it all. i think it's been misperceived, everyone going in expecting a stalkfest won't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story, it's here.......

george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.but what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey,where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit,half animal and half man wendigo,haunts a small town..."wendigo" by larry fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.the acting is great,the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined,or even if the story is taking place entirely in miles' head.overall,"wendigo" is my first contact with larry fessenden's work and surely won't be the last.give this film a chance,if you don't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10.

from the first scene, i was really excited. "i can tell this is going to be awesome!" i thought. the acting was so good, i felt as though i was eaves-dropping on these peoples' lives. the music too was exquisitely unsettling. the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward (one could sense) toward some irrevocable fate. the build was slow, but i personally love that kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn't get derailed before it's ready to pay off.so everything's going fine, and then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the credits are rolling. "what?!!!" was all i and my movie-night companion could say. if you understand the director's intentions, the blunt ending does make sense (for those of you who have seen the movie already, check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic.com), but i can't help saying it was not pulled off quite right.this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax. in any case, it's too bad. those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (but for those of you who don't write or make films, you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt, and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal!)wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished. but hay, i'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days).one other comment. some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing. i don't know how to explain it, but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent "monster" forms. although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie--i don't know, it still worked for me in some crooked way. i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again! :)

**possible spoilers**the biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is the wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie usually isn't far behind it. the filmmakers' interpretation of the wendigo's form is interesting, and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror, for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good. however, as a monster character it never really comes to life. we don't get much of an explanation for its behavior, and what we do see from it doesn't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself, or any wendigo lore i've ever read.i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do, in the movie. when you boil this film down to its bones, what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element, instead of a movie about a monster.the cinematography is good, though a little cheesy; the filmmakers use scenery, lighting, and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well. the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster in the film. it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo, which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend.i have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason the wendigo doesn't do much is that, when the monster suit was built, it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable (in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves, the performer had to walk on his toes) that it was nearly impossible to run, walk, or otherwise perform in it. thus the many flashes of the creature standing still, and the obvious sped-up footage of it running. i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed.

a solid b movie.i like jake weber. his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances. i liked the relationship between the father and son. i liked the family dynamics. the wendigo looks silly, but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer. it's an amalgamation like, see? this is a psychological story, not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick. watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine.nice work.

this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated. the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and, as with most younger children, he gets frightened easily. mainly because he simply doesn't understand things, like why his father is hardly ever there for him. from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the little boy doesn't. also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods, as it is established early on in the film, that the family is from the city. also, in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer, then get held up, then they argue with the locals about it, and the little boy surely didn't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all.the "wendigo" is ultimately what his young, innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this. there is the american indian legend, but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it, it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically. not because that's what the wendigo actually is, but because that is how he understands it. when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it. obviously it was low-budget and shot cheaply, but the jumping montages, use of light, and general eeriness more than make up for it. and the final question the film asks is: is it all in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10rated r: profanity, violence, and a sex scene

if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore, tons of jump-scare moments and unrelenting, escalating scenes of excruciating death, then look elsewhere. if you like quiet, moody, thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread, then wendigo is for you.thoughtful, stressed out george, his psychoanalyst wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city. on the way up, george hits a stag with his car. the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase. in particular, deranged hunter otis takes it personally. he follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. he spies on george and kim as they have sex. he fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home, letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return. when kim takes miles to the drugstore in town, miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case, carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag. a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo, a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry. miles takes the figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. that afternoon, when he and his father go sledding, george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed...or is he just in shock, and imagining the whole thing? hours later, george is rushed to the hospital and miles, still clutching his statue, either faints, dreams or goes on a vision quest, in which the wendigo returns. this time the angry, flesh eating god - part tree, part stag and part man - is hunting for otis, who has finally gone over the edge.wendigo is a beautifully made film, almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees. okay, so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking, but it's a small flaw, more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film, and the eerie backdrop of the silent, snowy countryside. the performances are great, particularly by jake weber as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife. they are a happy couple with their share of common problems, and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful. watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos, so realistic are the performances. this movie is not for everyone. a lot of people may find themselves totally bored, waiting for the hideous lovecraftian beast and bloody revenge that never come. we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists, seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also, later, through the eyes of a madman. this is more a psychological drama than a horror film, but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror.

larry fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum. well, the worst mistake, evidently, is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted. obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. "wendigo" is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles. things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. it is obvious that kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. this is also a story of alienation. it's clear that the father, george, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world.miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country. that part of new york state, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the little boy's imagination. it doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. ultimately, miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything, even evoking the wendigo spirit.the film is well paced and acted. patricia clarkson is excellent, no matter where movie she is in. jake weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand. erik per sullivan, as miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what's going on around him. finally, john spredakos is perfect as the menacing otis, a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.

kim (patricia clarkson), george (jake weber) and son miles (erik per sullivan) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattan's bustling metropolis. on the way, they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow. a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along. rather than helping, at least one of the hunters, otis (john speredakos), is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers. george, kim and miles are disturbed by otis, and even worse, we quickly learn that otis has learned where they're staying. meanwhile, miles is given a wendigo (a kind of indian shape-shifting spirit/monster) token by an indian whom only he has seen. is otis a psycho out to get our heroes? are there wendigos in the woods? i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers. it is a fairly low budget film, with technical limitations frequently showing through. much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature. and perhaps the fatal blow for many people, it has a very ambiguous ending, with a number of questions left unanswered. if you are discouraged by such endings, and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant, do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo.personally, i like films like that. i usually prefer some ambiguity. the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick, scary creature flick, where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end, and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2: the monster returns, but that's not what this film is. wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people. heck, writer/director larry fessenden even has a character, george, reciting robert frost. the frost poem, and george's comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things, is the key to the film.one of the best things about the film is its complexity. in a way, there are four different films occurring at the same time, a thread from each character. in george's thread, he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world, and he has some parenting problems. for him, the film is a realistic, horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse. in patricia's thread, she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family. she's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her, hoping that they'll go away and get better. in otis' thread, he's even more down on his luck than george, and george's arrival into his life symbolizes the final "crack" in his psychological armor. and in miles' thread, which is probably the most important of the film, life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world. but this is a horror story, after all, albeit one with a glimmer of hope, and the events in the film give miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn. still, when everything is said and done, he seems to be the only one retaining his composure, due to the poetic outlook.even though the film is low budget, there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions. fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations, and created some interesting slide show like montages (such as the cards, or the indian wendigo images from the book). there are also interesting more traditional montages, such as miles' nightmare. wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.other technical aspects are good for the budget. the "wendigo" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous. the lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been, but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock (it could have been digital instead) or transfer. i thought the performances were good and far more realistic (if you value that) than the majority of films. although i didn't really notice the score, it must have been okay, or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment.overall, wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions, as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch.

good sequel to murder in a small town. in this one cash and his police lt. buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch, and a family of screw-ups and their wierdo helpers. as in the original, the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre-war america. go see it.

pleasant, diverting and charming. the best part is the swing numbers, especially the rendition of my buddy, partial though it may have been. the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film.

this is just one more example of the absolute genius of gene wilder. he wrote and starred in this terrific mystery. no one could have done it better. the suspense was palpable throughout. i wish mr. wilder would grace us with another of these. i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr. wilder in but i had no idea how truly talented he was until i saw "murder in a small town," and this follow-on. he truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and, of course, in his brilliant acting. his subtle wit comes through in spades. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and/or gene wilder's film work. his star just gets brighter and brighter.

"the lady in question (1999)" starring gene wilder is a well-acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white raymond burr perry mason series. both perry and "cash" kept me guessing right up to the end. there were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but i had no idea which character it would be.gene wilder has a special charming wit about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part. the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well. i'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off. i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie. even his singing was a delight. i like him in this role more than his former "sillier" roles like "the young frankenstein" and "willy wonka." i am hoping a & e will continue this series. they ought to call it something like "the a & e gene wilder mysteries."the music fit the period. i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes. i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period. and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script. to me, that always distracts.overall, my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well-crafted start in what we hope will be many others -- just like one of our other favorites: raymond burr's perry mason.

a delightful if somewhat predictable tv movie, though i admit a little bias -- as far as i'm concered, the more gene wilder in this world the better. i'd love to see numerous additional movies detailing the adventures of larry "cash" carter!

robert urich was a fine actor, and he makes this tv movie believable. i remember watching this film when i was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich californian town. urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family, and i love the halloween space suit idea, brilliant. this film is about the battle of one's sprit. tv quality, that exceeds, the big budget, gangs of new york. i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie? i hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.

everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in, as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. but no paradise would be complete without its snake. strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly holds secrets. the father is not a joiner, but pressure is on him to join, as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members. robert urich's good guy part is a bit tepid, but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles. suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson. look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet. the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for. i have seen this movie quite a few times.

a classy film pulled in 2 directions. to its advantage it is directed by wes craven. on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget. it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club. his latest invention, a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood. anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci. her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later. the actor, scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine. lucci and barbara steele's portrait in 'black sunday' were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae. probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine. so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film.

better than the typical made-for-tv movie, invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting (urich, lucci, cassidy, mccarthy, pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto, soleil moon-frye) and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot. urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles. kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live, the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10

when the scientist and family man matt winslow (robert urich) finally accepts the invitation to work the micro-digitech corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife patricia (joanna cassidy) and their son robbie (barret oliver) and daughter chrissy (soleil moon frye) to a huge modern house in the corporation compound. they meet their friend tom peterson (joe regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle, and tom invites the winslow family to join the steaming springs country club. tom tries to seduce matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in micro-digitech, but matt is not tempted with the offer. later he is introduced to the director of the club, jessica jones (susan lucci) that befriends patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about jessica and the members.in the 80's, when i saw "invitation to hell", i liked this movie that partially recalls "the stepford wives", with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound. i have just seen it today, and i found a great metaphoric message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries. i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story, but i believe it fits perfectly. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "convite para o inferno" ("invitation to hell")

updated version of a story that had been turned into the film in 1938 england(return of the frog) concerning the pursuit by the police of a master criminal known as the frog because of the frog like get up (bulging eyes etc) he wears.one of the good wallace films from the 1960's it's a solid little entertainment. clearly influenced by ( or did this influence) the restart of the dr mabuse films, the frog seems to be more a super villain than a master thief. while not the best of the wallace films, it is worth a look. it would make an interesting double feature with the excellent earlier film.between 6 and 7 out of 10.

this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: although his majesty, mr. kinski, is missing you still have young joachim 'blacky' fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical clever american 'womanizer', you have young eddi arendt in his best (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated british butler - and you have (not so young anymore) lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: highly entertaining) police investigator. furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (please remind the time of its origin!), yelling scream queens, and on and on... all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness - highly recommended!!

the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j-horror movie. this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks.the story is about perception of the people who works, lives, and loves of our protagonist, and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth. the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course, and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems. the movie mostly took place in a small, out-dated radio station's studio with a very bad history, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating. it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind. what i like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did. this movie is a very smart, abide rather short 76 minutes film.

like talk radio, the booth is actually kinda predictable (talk radio because we know the truth of what happened going in, the booth because of- let's face it- the genre and the basic set-up). that's not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. it means, in essence, that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in, say, an american version of this story. the booth moves inexorably toward its (foregone) conclusion, but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of (very scenic) road. it reminds me of harlan ellison's spooky short story, flop sweat. the claustrophobia is, at times, almost palpable. worth a nice long look.

i liked this movie because it basically did more with less. it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more (though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop).the guy playing the dj did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories. i also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny.while parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away, other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did.i thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part, concentrating more on the living side of the equation. the last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed.while it was a shorter movie, it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story. any more and it would have started to drag.

a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. there's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works. the scares are very subtle, not the jump-cut scares that seem to populate most recent asian horror films. the way the "scares" are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in "the uninvited" (aka 4 inyong shiktak, directed by su-leon lee), but this isn't nearly to the same caliber. the film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. it's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance.

although the plot was a bit sappy at times, and very rushed at the end, as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story, overall it was pretty good for the made-for-backwoods-cable-tv genre. however, the actress who played the babysitter, mariana klaveno, was very good! i hope to see more of her around in movie-land. the music was also well done, getting every possible chill out of the dah-duh-dah-duh (think "jaws") type music-based tension build-ups.i don't think i'd want to watch "while the children sleep" again, but if i did, it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno.

always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very very complicated young gal,(holly gooding),"skipped parts",2000, who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer, george newbern,(patrick highsmith),"far harbor",'96. many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father. if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture. if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern, this film should be seen only on halloween night! however, it sure has it's surprises in the end!!!!

there is a certain genius behind this movie. i was laughing throughout. the scene in the phone sex office, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor. execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent. the doppelganger split at the end was like... "ok, wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say". certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level? i'm easily bored by many movies, but this one kept my interest throughout.i think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. horribly bad, but good. i'm looking for other movies this person may have done (with more experience).

drew barrymore was excellent in this film. this role is the type of role you don't normally see drew play. her typical role is as a woman looking for love. the storyline is also great.when holly is implicated in her mother's murder she moves to l.a. she moves in with a guy who becomes her lover. but her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused. it is then revealed to her lover that she has multiple personality disorder. after that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her. in the end though, they find out the truth.

when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at tiffany's, you know something is going to go right. drew barrymore, patrick highsmith, leslie hope, and sally kellerman are excellent actors. the fbi agent was a terrible actor. the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier, those was just weird. drew barrymore is very hot. intimate strangers, where sally kellerman worked, was a great part. the weird gummy worm was just weird. nathan was a very handsome cat. but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr. gooding attacked him? and the scene with dr. wallace? what was he doing fumbling around in there? and not every male has a female, as sally kellerman stated. and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of victor's, that was weird.

i liked it! the plot was weird, drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them. drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time. dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool, and as always he does his best - i'm a major dennis fan anyway, that's why i bought the dvd.i didn't get the ending! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool, which is ok i guess but it could have been more. ....and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it? it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc-or was it dennis all the time? because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick. in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice.the music was ok but obtrusive in places, the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone.a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude. all in all a bit of a gpm-guilty pleasure movie. don't read too much into it, don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it. there are some diamond moments and goofs galore- watch it and just have a bit of fun with it!

welcome back kiefer sutherland. it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie,, and what a movie this was, was it 24 no,, but very intriguing, especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent. kiefer's character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie,, kiefer's partner,, is eva longoria,, the desperate houswife. wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good,, i wish though that kim bassinger had a bigger role,, but other than that, i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller, everybody played their part to the hilt. nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie,, so as to keep you guessing at all times. and i really think that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie,, but in my opinion michael douglas had the besxt performance of the day,, thumbs up.

my take: makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement. the plot is familiar. an innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the president of the united states, the first traitor in the united states secret service. as his fellow secret-service agents pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. of course we know his innocent, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but i was still entertained by the sentinel. in this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too abundant in action sequences, the sentinel is a good lick-back to all those good old-fashioned political crime thriller. the familiar plot is elevated by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances.michael douglas, the perfect man for the job, is long-running secret service agent pete garrison, who is framed for being part of a plot to assassinate the president. former colleagues in the secret service (kiefer sutherland and eva longoria) pursue harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the secret service. this leads to a lot of chase scenes that, surprisingly (and thankfully), are never unbelievable. the screenplay also offers a subplot involving garrison having an affair with the first lady (played by kim basinger). this thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films.the films director is clark johnson (s.w.a.t.) who manages to make the film look good. although many have criticized it as "should have been a tv movie", i must disagree. agreed, this is not a perfect film, and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political intrigues like in the line of fire or an episode from the tv series 24 (which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star sutherland), but even so, this film takes its plot into serious heights and doesn't abandon even its smaller details. the performances are terrific (with a top-notch cast, its bound to be, even with the by-the-numbers script.all-in-all, i award it ***1/2, not perfect, but not far from it.rating: ***1/2 out of 5.

it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about.the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate. the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this: a plot to kill the president of the united states. michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed.kiefer sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine. one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president,it also concerns a mole(traitor) in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction.

i'll be honest,i finally checked this movie not because of the stars--though they were reasonably watchable and compelling,particularly the three leads--or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service(something,i've been informed through the dvd extras of this show,has yet to ever happen.assuming that's true,that's remarkable!). i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective meldrick lewis!! well,okay,clark johnson,one of my faves from "homicide:life on the street" and a veteran (mostly) tv director. i'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average,despite the possibilities.veteran and ace secret agent pete garrison(michael douglass)has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend,targeted and blew up an air force one chopper and is gunning for the prez.(david rasche. anyone remember "sledgehammer"?). his affair with the first lady(kim basinger,clearly one of the hotter first ladies we've ever had,fictional or real)is certainly not helping his standing. he's got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief(kiefer sutherland,almost still completely in "24" mode). throw in some other pivotal service agents(martin donovan and the foxy,somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva longorria) and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired,if underwhelming,results.the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers. the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie,though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most (myself included) interested.

seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this. i also think this applies to eva longoria fans.the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president. as the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete (michael douglas). pleading innocence, pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.it's solid, but certainly not spectacular. a decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, but you could certainly do far worse.

this was a pretty decent movie. this movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained. just a typical hollywood film. this movie will never win an oscar or anything and definitely doesn't deserve one, but i thought it was pretty good. it's kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format. if you like the whole we've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick. i personally think that storyline has been done way too much, but the sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the secret service. all in all, this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life, but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good?

good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and passionless; the president was a cardboard cut-out. and who were the real villains anyway? nothing was developed or explained sufficiently. i still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved. the villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. michael douglas and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good. but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles, basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent. this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way, with too many unanswered questions. disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes. and did they use the 'west wing' set for the white house scenes? - i kept expecting cj or charlie to appear!

the sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichéd suspense/mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing. these stories have already for the most part gone through as many permutations as we can bear, so what we're left with is how good is the acting, how smart are the setups and bad guys, how well crafted is the main plot etc etc.....so the sentinel does a solid job given it's content. michael douglass and kiefer sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes. eva longoria (first time i've seen her on screen) brings some satisfactory support. the whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit, but it deserves slack. worth a viewing if you like the genre.

the sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right.a great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasn't and it was a very smart story. michael douglas in this film is very good and keither sutherland is too,but however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as jack bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in the sentinel than he is in 24.also another person trying to shrug off their tv role but failed.eva longeria.she wasn't that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing.after i saw the film i had constant dreams about the sentinel and couldn't sleep.overall sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it.

i can admit that the screenplay isn't very good, and that it has some slow parts, but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun. first of all, the performances are great (michael douglas, kim basinger, kiefer sutherland, and eva longoria. michael douglas proves he has still got it, and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife. kiefer sutherland and eva longoria, play the dynamic duo, both adding their incredible talent to the pot. and second of all, this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore. its plain and simple, if you want to go to the movies, and have a lot of fun see, the sentinel.

i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.when i finally saw it,i took a good surprise.the movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done.this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or alias.it's very similar to that series and it reminded me too,to the wolfgang petersen's thriller in the line of fire.if you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies,you will be disappointed.but if you go with little expectations,you will enjoy the sentinel.rating:7

i enjoyed this film. i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot. unfortunately, for michael douglas' character, "pete garrison," they think he's the mole but he isn't. he's just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the first lady! since he's doing that, he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the president."garrison" is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. douglas does a fine job in this role. i don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor. keifer sutherland ("david breckinridge") is equally as good (at least in here) as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth. when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. the crooks are interesting, too, by the way. also, i have never - and never will, unfortunately - see a first lady who looks as good as kim basingerthis is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish. are there holes in it? of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments. however, it is unfairly bashed here. it just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website. my advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. yes, it gets a little rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment.....which is what movies are all about.

at first glance, this film looks like the keifer sutherland series 24 for the big screen. with the focus on a plot to assassinate the president of the united states, a race against time, and plenty of secret service agents, the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel.but wait, the protagonist turns out to be michael douglas' character pete garrison instead, a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981. the ss agents are specially trained to "take the bullet", which is what makes them special - who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target? but garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot, and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot. all this because of his failure in a polygraph test, due to his adulterous banging of the first lady (kim basinger). tsk.there are shades of clint eastwood's in the line of fire. both featured aging actors, and aging veteran has-been heroes with a bit of a historical reference, who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty. while eastwood's movie has a more enigmatic villain in john malkovich, the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain, preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex-kgb villains, and the mole within the presidential detail. with douglas on the run from the law, he becomes similar to dr. richard kimble of the fugitive, hunting the proverbial one-armed man while at the same time, relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents, which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes, it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents.keifer sutherland and eva longoria, top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate housewives, get relegated into support roles as the secret service investigators who are looking into garrison's probable involvement in the assassination plot, and at times seem to have lept off the pages of csi with their forensics skills. the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled x-files' fox mulder and dana scully, but alas these two had very little to do here. we know the reason why they're in the movie, and that is to get their fans into the theatres. also, longoria's role seemed unable to shake off her sexy-mama gabrielle, and here, has her in fairly low cut blouses (sutherland actually tells her to cover up) and tight pants (ogle-fest for fellow agents).nonetheless, it's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world, and the typical threats that they face daily, including the following up on every nutcase's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world. it's a decent suspense and investigative thriller, with enough subplots to keep you entertained. but one thing though, like most ending action sequences, this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through.

it's been 19 years since gordon gekko used "wall street" to let us know that greed is good. now, michael douglas takes the gg persona and morphs it into a secret service agent, pete garrison. guess what? it works! this is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. the detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the ss on behalf of the president and first lady was likewise intriguing. all the leads were pretty good but, try as i might, i could not accept eva longoria as a secret service agent. whereas jodie foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was fbi agent starling in "silence of the lambs", you do not get the same feeling with longoria. nevertheless, this is a fun film, escapist entertainment with the beltway as the backdrop.

there was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer. for starters, the casting didn't seem right. kiefer sutherland had already done very well in "24" and the preview didn't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience. eva longoria appeared out of place, and the rest didn't seem very interesting.when the film finally ended, i was not completely displeased for i had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better, had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development. we have seen threats of this type before, and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers. as an audience, we don't want to sit through the same old story again. we want to see something different, be thrilled and entertained.there is nothing wrong with the casting. from kim basinger's delicious first lady. she carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable. michael douglas has been and done that before. unfortunately, the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate. sutherland rehashes his "24" tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and eva does a passable job, as the newcomer.don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ("north by northwest" and "the fugitive" come to mind). leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be. it's o.k.

"kalifornia" is a good hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross-country to california to share the cost of gas: a pair of losers (lewis & pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer (duchovny & forbes). pitt "nails" his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. a good watch for those into psycho-killer flix.

so-so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis, who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west. the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; pitt's a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to dave) and juliette is his poor, not-all-there companion. this is a good cast and the story moves along, but pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better earlier roles. the best thing is here is michelle forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on `homicide: life on the street' or in the brief series `wonderland.'vote: 6

"kalifornia"is a great film that makes us look at ourselves.the film has a great cast,brad pitt(johnny suede,a river runs through it,and the legends of the fall)as early grayce,david duchovny(the x files)as brian kessler,michelle forbes(star trek:the next generation,homicide:life on the street,and escape from l.a.)as carrie loughlin,brian's girlfriend,and juliette lewis(natural born killers,cape fear,and what's eating gilbert grape)as adele corners,early's girlfriend.brian kessler is a writer who is a liberal,is getting ready to write a book about serial killers.brian and his girlfriend,carrie decide they want to move to california,so brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to california,to share expenses on the trip.early grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole,who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town,is in debt,owes his landlord money.early's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job.early goes to the college and sees the ad,he later tells adele,his girlfriend about leaving to go to california.early and adele meet brian and carrie at the bus stop and leave town.brian and carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord.for a little while brian and carrie thought of early and adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends,carrie and adele become real good friends.their journey is a very learning one.though brain and carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie.the question brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question.early grayce is a sociopath who doesn't see the error of his ways,goes down hill later on and pays the price.this film is a great movie,i give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up.i love the songs in the movie,especially at the end of the film,the song"look up to the sky"by the indians.

david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california, but can't really afford to, so they 'ride share" with another young couple (brad pitt and juliette lewis) to save on expenses. the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way, sites where serial killers did their thing, since brian (duchovny) is a writer and carrie (forbes) is his photographer. what they don't know is that pitt (earley) and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says. i don't care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles. the scary thing is that he does them so well; i've actually known people like him before, no, not killers, but with pretty much the same mindset. anyway, as the road trip goes along, carrie guesses that the others are about out of money, but earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow....never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though. lewis does her role well, one that she excels at, a not-too-bright waif that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by earley when she does something he doesn't like. as things begin to get more unacceptable carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station, and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they've been ride-sharing with, after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip. this is not the greatest flick in the world, but it's not bad...i watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version, because this seemed fairly tame to me, really...not that this makes it family fare or anything, unless it's maybe the manson family. 7 out of 10.

i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious. it's mostly because of brad pitt's performance. spot on.the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie. the atmosphere was perfect in all respects. i'm not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever.brutal,honest,gritty. all good words to describe this movie.i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind early's violence isn't explained. it is explained but they thankfully don't have to go into graphic detail to get their point across.overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. underrated.

this movie is great! brad pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie. duchovny was top notch, as was forbes and lewis. the 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites, in one of the coolest cars ever made, 1960's model lincoln continental. early grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. he likes his women to not curse or smoke, and wear pwt dresses. duchovny and forbes are a pair of artists from the city, while early and lewis are trailer parkers from the rural outskirts. even though the majority tone in the film is dark, there are plenty of funny scenes to be had. the writing, directing, and acting are brilliant. if you like road movies, murder, humor, and narration, watch this film. everyone delivers, and you will want more when the credits roll. one of my all time favorites. "hey...shave that dog n teach it to hunt!"

i can't say too much about kalifornia as sadly i have yet to actually see the whole thing (i've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on fuse.) but what i have seen is absolutely awesome! i am a fan of brad pitt but i admit not all his earlier movies are well good. but this role, i just, his acting is great, his character early seems so normal well okay creepy, dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type i guess. and juliette lewis's performance although i can see how some may be annoyed by it i think it's amazing. sadly i have yet to see the end, but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good, but disappointing. i have to admit that i wish david duchovany's (sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect) was a bit flat but for him it was okay. his wife's character was better, and i thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good, a portrait of the avant-gard/older sister type. particularly the scene where early and brian go to play pool, and adele and carrie are having their one on one time together. i've watched that scene at least twice now and i still think the acting in it is just wonderful. one because of the emotion that adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about early and carrie's reaction to it. everything about that i think is just so perfect. i mean, maybe it's because i can relate a bit, i'm not sure. as for brad pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once; i thought he was great. some movies with pitt that i've seen were just average or not worth seeing. i don't think i've ever seen a terrible pitt movie or if i have it's not because of his acting it's other factors. this movie was not one of them. he turned out a great performance in kalifornia. i swear i'm not just some random i do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking, i mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means! pitt is dark, brooding and downright scary at times. yet he's also cheerful, funny, nice, and even loving towards adele. granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the tv and strangle him but that's probably just me (and the character pitt played in the movie.) but it also shows how good pitt's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character, that is what good acting is supposed to do. at any rate i wish i could say more, but that's all i can really say without having seen the ending, i have seen most of the movie through what i've caught on fuse and as i'm writing this i'm taping it on dvr so hopefully i can write a more complete review later. i just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that i thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked (it shouldn't have!)

a surprisingly effective thriller, this.david duchovny and michelle 'ensign ro' forbes are a successful, professional couple, he a writer, she a photographer. forbes is desperate to move to california and, in an act of compromise, mulder agrees to the move on the condition that, along the way, they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers. his idea: he writes the words, she takes the pictures, with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life. to help finance the trip, they decide to car share and advertise the fact. as their bad luck would have it brad pitt sees the advert and, shortly after killing his landlord, he and his girlfriend, juliette lewis, meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek. inevitably, mischief ensues.pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring early grayce and is capably backed up by lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting. duchovny and forbes make for a convincing double act too and, as events spiral out of control, you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting.intelligent, sinister and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition beyond its current status. a top movie.

this was one scary movie.brad pitt deserved an oscar for this.a traveling novelist (played by david duchovny of the x-files fame) and his girlfriend pick up two hitch-hikers(juliette lewis and brad pitt) on their way to california. on their way they stop at infamous serial killer murder scenes to photography the scenes for an upcoming book duchovny's character is working on, little do they know that the most disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting right next to them in the same car.

**** = a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten***1/2 = a classic in time; simply a must see*** = a solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece**1/2 = a good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws** = may still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)*1/2 = mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsbomb = not of a viewable quality- kalifornia = ***- unrated (for strong violent material, considerable sexuality, and language)i rented this film expecting an in-your-face summer-blockbuster-quality celebration of brad pitt's face, but was happily surprised and disappointed. this really is more of a drama, and very grim at that... i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice-overs.pitt plays out his possibly un-sexiest film ever with startling talent. who started out as a hopeless yet harmless "white trash" husband became realized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind. during some of the latter stages in the film, i found it hard to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and scary. this proves very good writing and acting.the whole movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once, and i don't mean action scenes. i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing. it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death. again, i am very impressed with the screenwriter(s); whoever they are did the impossible: mixed oil and water.i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis's performance. it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy. some of her moments in this film brought me to tears. i mean that. the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible, and i clearly remember getting blurry-eyed on a few occasions.i almost feel like i'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving "kalifornia" a *** rating. but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it. i do believe that everyone should see this movie though. i truly do.

i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me. alas, i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by 'kalifornia' upon watching again recently. i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago.there are two things which really give this movie its power. the first is its cast. we have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace. knowing pitt, as we all do, as one of the most enduring heart-throbs hollywood has ever had, it is refreshing to see him play such a vile, unattractive character. pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white-trash cliché or parody, and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie.juliette lewis is equally impressive as grace's tragic girlfriend, playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old's life experience. lewis manages to evoke pity (for her character's station in life) as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young. personally, i think it's a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here.david duchovony and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis. duchovony is aptly geeky and naive, and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut-off, but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters' changes as they are equally intrigued, repulsed and strangely attracted to pitt.the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside, this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing. at the time 'kalifornia' was released, hollywood was releasing a slew of nice-character-turns-out-to-be-psychotic movies ('single white female', 'pacific heights', 'the hand that rocks the cradle', 'deceived', 'sleeping with the enemy' etc). most of these movies followed the same formula, the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy. 'kalifornia' doesn't really stray too far from this territory, but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow-boil thriller, and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn.when the penny does drop, and pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy, the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don't quite live up to rest of the movie. that said, the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold. the fight is over, but the scars will always be there.much of the narration (provided by a somewhat whiny, pre x-files duchovony) is a tad contrived. of course, it's meant to be from the book the duchovony's journalist character has written, so one could argue that the self-conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write.the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the past twenty years. highly recommended, but not for the weak of stomach or mind. this film is disturbing on more than one level. but then, it's meant to be.

in 1990 brad pitt and juiliette lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia. i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend, art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers. in fact he's got a most unusual odyssey planned, he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers. but he and forbes are flat broke.fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip. it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own, delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality.kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for, but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree. pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from deliverance. but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well. watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. lewis's dialog and forbes's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country.for those who like their slasher flicks, they don't come better than kalifornia.

if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer, it comes across as decidedly average.a journalist [duchovny] travels across country to california to document america's most famous murderers, unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [pitt] is a serial killer himself.rather predictable throughout, this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well, but i'd not bother to see it again.

kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. a journey on the darkest road ever. the road of no return. the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california. the man (david duchovny in his best role up to now) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures. so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way. to share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad. but the couple that answers it is not just any couple. it is one of the strangest couples ever. the girl is a naive, frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses. the man is exactly the opposite. a cruel ruthless murderer. we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia (not with c as usual, but with k, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his journey of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. all the leads, duchovny, pitt, lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star. the photography is amazing, with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie, and the music suits the dark character of the film. on the whole this is a really good movie. don't miss it. you'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with!

i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night. i do like juliette lewis although i'm indifferent to brad pitt. after this viewing i have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable, and i didn't think "brad pitt" at all.unfortunately i can't say the same for david duchovny. i'm an x-files fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as i'd thought it was made a few years later. i like duchovny but found his character a little two-dimensional here, except where he's doing voice-overs. that part was strong, seemed in character, good intonation, etc. otherwise i kept thinking "agent mulder", which is a pity.michelle forbes was a treat. why haven't i noticed her before? (i'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap) i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis, this film, and "natural born killers" (a firm favourite). interesting though to see a contrast of characters - in nbk she's a willing accomplice, whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge early's dark side until it's thrust in her face.i enjoyed this film almost unreservedly. apart from duchovny's character not seeming fully-formed (and perhaps being "washed out" somewhat by pitt's), it was perfect. i was also pleased with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes did not die, yet they had to suffer first. it was realistic, tense, disturbing.if you like nbk you may well like this movie, and vice-versa.

kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights. ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post. kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer. great performances all around by the leads with pitt in particular being exceptional. check it out!!

kalifornia came out in 1993, just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006. this is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all david duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work, like with most of his episodes of the x-files, playing god, and red shoe diaries.people who were put off by the heavy southern accent from brad pitt and juliette lewis' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south. for every "brian and carrie" in the south, there is an "adele and early" and in 2006, that's the real horror of this flick.aside from that, i think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with carrie's photography, it's not suitable for mass consumption. but if you have a copy of this in your personal library, i think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies.

i had seen 'kalifornia' before (must be about 10 years ago) and i still remember to be very impressed by it. that's why i wanted to see it again and all i can say is that it still hasn't lost its power, even though i'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that i was ten years ago.'kalifornia' tells the tale of the writer brian kessler and his girlfriend carrie laughlin, a photographer, who want to move to california. but instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains, they choose to make a trip by car. he wants to write a book about america's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures. but because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol, they decide to take another couple with them, so they can spread the costs of the trip. only one couple has answered the add, so they will automatically be the lucky ones. but they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time, when their trip has already started, carrie is shocked. without wanting to be prejudiced, she can only conclude that early grayce and adele corners are poor white trailer park trash. she definitely doesn't want them in her car, but brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway. at first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all, but gradually early grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer...not only is the story very impressive, so is the acting from our four leads. brad pitt is incredible as early grayce. his performance in this movie may well be his best ever. the same for juliette lewis. she plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her early and does that really very well. but david duchovny and michelle forbes are a surprise as well. they both did a very good job and i really wonder why we never heard anything from forbes again since this movie, because she really proves to have a lot of talent.overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story, but because of the graphic violence, i can imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste (although i don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way). personally i really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me (it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out). i reward this movie with an 8/10.

i just got done watching "kalifornia" on showtime for the fourth time since i first saw it back in july of 2001. you would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films, that "kalifornia" would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn't. perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 1996-1999, maybe it might have been more successful. in my opinion, "kalifornia" is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s. it has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer films like "seven" or "the bone collector". many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them. "kalifornia" is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind. it tries to answer questions like "why do they do the things they do? is it because of something that happened in their past? does it make them feel superior or powerful? or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill?" these are some of the things that "kalifornia" tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves. brad pitt makes an everlasting impression as early grayce. when we first meet early in the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual. when we first see him, it's late at night. early is possibly drunk. we then see him pick up a rock, throw it off a bridge, and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car. pitt is fierce in this film. it is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people. it's funny that this would later lead him play a true loon like in "12 monkeys" and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in david fincher's "seven".

it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem. everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction: what a great movie!!i've never much cared for brad pitt (though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement) but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving, dark and right on target.everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings. the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening.the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before it, the ending is a bit too long and overblown. but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic.if you check this film out, try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option.rating:9

"kalifornia" is one of my all-time favourite movies, and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s. the film has a very stylish surface to it, but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. one of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances, brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named early. pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. "kalifornia" has a very simple plot to it, that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder, as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. there are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. "kalifonia" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.

in the same vein as natural born killers, another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved, kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence, but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act. kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good. david duchovny plays brian kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, i don't know where, places where nudity passes for art. maybe it really does and i just don't understand it. at any rate, brian and carrie (duchovny and michelle forbes, who fits the role flawlessly), make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. brian, the writer, will write the book, carrie can take the pictures.being artistic types, brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip, so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses, and are contacted by early grace and adele corners (brad pitt and juliette lewis). early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer, sees the ad on a bulletin board, and decides to leave the state for a while, violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation. two birds with one stone, you know.the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type. brian and carrie are artsy liberals, but while carrie catches on to early and adele, brian is fascinated with early's status as an outlaw, as seen in the scene where brian shoots early's gun. never having fired a gun before, he's as fascinated as a little kid. while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early "broke her" of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink (early doesn't think women should), early and brian are out at the local bar. brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him, and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. "hit him, bri, it's comin'." this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it's so funny what early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away, bloodied and battered, but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, their differences, and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them. and besides that, because brian benefited from early's actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele, it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele.clearly, by now, you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller, where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues. on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer, but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes. while studying the actions of past murderers, brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying, and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.i am constantly amazed at brad pitt's versatility as an actor. consider, for example, his roles in movies like kalifornia, 12 monkeys, fight club, and ocean's 11 and 12. pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character, and is completely believable. incidentally, i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year, but just couldn't get the hair and beard right. i even got the hat right, which initially i thought would be the hardest part.it's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter. a film that didn't glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly. the glorification is all embodied in brian's and carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with early and adele. the movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.

it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem. everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction: what a great movie!!i've never much cared for brad pitt (though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement) but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving, dark and right on target.everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings. the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening.the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before it, the ending is a bit too long and overblown. but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic.if you check this film out, try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option.rating:9

it's a road movie, with a killer on-board. brian kessler (david duchovny), a sophisticated, urbane writer, wants to conduct field research on american serial killers. but, neither he, nor his girlfriend, carrie (michelle forbes), has the money for a cross-country tour of murder sites, so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses. who they end up with is a young couple, early grayce (brad pitt) and his girlfriend, adele (juliette lewis), two better examples of "poor white trash" you will never find in all of cinema.indeed, early and adele are what make this film so entertaining, as they babble, cackle, confide, muse, speculate, drool, and otherwise behave in ways i haven't seen since reruns of "the beverly hillbillies". early's idea of california: "people think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather; cold weather makes people stupid". that's enough to convince adele: "i guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here". to which early responds proudly: "it sure does". early continues to instruct adele about california: "you never have to buy no fruit, on account it's all on the trees ... and they ain't got no speed limits, and i hear your first month's rent is free, state law".but poor early has some, well, mental problems, which become ever more obvious to brian and carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the u.s. as they enter the desert southwest, with its beautifully stark landscape, "kalifornia" starts to look more and more like "the hitcher" (1986), and early starts to act more and more like john ryder, everyone's maniacal hitchhiker, whose terror seemed so unstoppable.in "kalifornia", the acting is uneven. duchovny's performance is flat. brad pitt is surprisingly effective, despite his overacting at times. michelle forbes is great as the avant-garde, photographic artist. but my choice for best performance goes to juliette lewis. with her nasal voice and heavy-duty southern accent, she is stunning, as the naive, highly animated, child-like adele.toward the end, the film takes on a twilight zone feel to it, as our travelers enter a nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins. the plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence, an ending that was somewhat disappointing.overall, however, "kalifornia" is an entertaining film, thanks to a clever concept, great scenery, especially in the second half, good cinematography, great dialogue, and that wonderful performance by juliette lewis.

i recently (may 2008) discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd. although i've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then (late 70's (i was 10 in 1978)), this three-episode, low budget thing still stands strong.what's fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter, and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then: the creepy music (she had to hold my hand, even though she's been raised with watching lotr and resident evil), the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is, and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting.this is the one and only good science fiction movie (or series) ever made in norway. and it's still worth watching.

i remember this show from swedish television. i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s. when i think of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. the term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them.

it's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from norway has been remastered for dvd release, and still gems like this don't get a shot at recapturing their past glory. i give this a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few scifi films made for norwegian television. this film is nothing less than a film-historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first alien film. and, my word, blindpassasjer was first! did ridley scott or anyone in the crew see the mini-series? however unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. okay, the budget is _much_ lower in the norwegian film, but given that, it's a really well-done piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian movie-making, which incidentally lasted until the 90s.

ok. i admit. i'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series. star trek (next generation) was my first space date, and since then i've switched partners regularly. i've seen'em all, it seems, and my favorites are «lexx», «farscape» and the new «battlestar galactica», in other words: the newest, state of the art space operas. but, i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones, the cheap ones, like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show «blakes7». here, the budgets are smaller than hobbits, the special effects seem to be made on a commodore 64, but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor, the acting dead serious and at times even high class?but why do they always speak english in the space future? because this is not the future, it's fantasy for kids. still, it can be irritating at times. me, being a norwegian, have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series, like science fiction, for scandinavian viewers. i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened. but it did, actually, once, and even in my own homeland, norway. i was two years old when the so called fjernsynsteatret (tv theater section) of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer (the stowaway).when i first heard of it, i was not surprised of the fact that until this day, the show has only been screened once in norway, making it impossible for me to actually see it. it went on swedish, danish and finnish television also, in it's time, but that was a long time ago. there have been no video or dvd release of it, not a surprise either, and when it was screened on an art house cinema, this happened in bergen, a city far far away from oslo (where i live). and then there's another fact about «blindpassasjer» that didn't surprise me, that it was written by the two norwegian authors tor åge bringsværd and jon bing (bing&bringsværd). this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegians in the seventies; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose. in my opinion, bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers, and has written several great and entertaining novels, masterpieces even, some of them hilarious, such as «bazar» and «syvsoverskens dystre frokost». no other than this guy, also an acclaimed dramatist, could construct the script of «blindpassasjer».when i finally got to watch it, it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the 80's, eventually managed to transform it to dvd and give it to me. he was a nice bloke. so i sat down and watched it, with swedish subtitles, bad sound and some scrapes and errors; but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love it.the exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in blakes7, and the credit goes to caprino studios (who made the famous flåklypa grand prix), and the interior of the marco polo (the space ship) works better than i'd expected. the acting is typically theatrical, but it works better than when they play ibsen, to put it mildly, and bjørn floberg carries his role solidly, as does trini lund. the legendary actress henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre, but this is an ensemble play, and i'm happy to say that ola b. johannesen carries his mustache with nobility, and marit østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.but is it really that good? well, one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending, the pretentious criticism of «modern society», but yes, it's, well, not really really really fantastic, but charming, cool, nostalgic and pleasant. one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi.

a good film with strong performances (especially the two leads). the film is about two american girls who are caught with 6 kilo's heroin on an airport in thailand. they're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession. bill pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out. all they have to do is find a nick parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. so far for the story which isn't that original (it has many resemblances with the better return to paradise).the acting and newton thomas sigel's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch. a 7 out of 10.

this is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. the philippines substitute for thailand and nobody actually goes to hong kong. the stock shot of a cathay pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly. this film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. it contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into. solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office. an excellent piece of work!

after high-school graduation, best friends alice and darlene, decide to take a trip to thailand. whilst they are there, they meet a charming australian guy named nick. after spending some time with nick, he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him. they agree. at the airport though, they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a thai prison for something they say they haven't done. not really knowing what to do they end contacting yankee hank, an american lawyer who lives in thailand with his wife. word has it that if you have the money he can help you. things start of well, but they still can't get out.the movie is really good because it doesn't let on what's going to happen and it's interesting all the time. i couldn't believe the ending though. it was one of those endings where you don't know the 100% truth, but you still kind of know what really happened with nick and the drug smuggling because of the 'owning up' etc. claire danes and kate beckinsale both give quite good performances here. beckinsales performance was a little weak though. both danes and beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger. paul walker even has a small uncredited role here. ;)anyway, i thought brokedown palace was a good movie and i give it a 7/10.

good exciting movie, although it looks to me that it's not been recorded on location in thailand, it still looks realistic. nice story about some girls having 'fun' in one of the most beautiful countries on the world. in real the thai people are very kind.

*possible spoilers* although done before (and better) in 'midnight express' and 'return to paradise', brokedown palace still strikes a chord with me.here we have the tale of two young girls who travel through thailand, and get arrested on charges of trafficking drugs. was it clare danes' alice? was it kate beckinsale's darlene? was it the handsome stranger whom they met on their journey? none of that really matters, for this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits they can be stretched to. throw in bill pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and jacqueline kim as his thai bride (and better lawyer than he is) and we have a nice little story that holds the audience's attention.brokedown palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for any reason - it is not an original concept, it doesn't show sensationalised violence that leads to the wannabe-avant-garde crowd talking about it's "gritty realism" or "hard hitting truths" - it is merely a good story with some fine performances. bill pullman is weakest with his lazy drawl and gravelly way of talking - i was quite bored with the character.kate beckinsale, while decent, is nothing spectacular. she acts well, but it's not exactly a memorable performance.jacqueline kim however, is in fine form, crafting a likable and defined character where, really, there is not much to work with.but make no mistake - this is clare danes' movie. i've long been a fan of her work, and this is no change. she captivates in every scene she appears, and were it not for her, the film would probably stoop into boring fare. i particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and darlene's father.the film also has a brilliant soundtrack.7 out of 10

i think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! or damn australian? i still don't know, but what i know is that i really liked this movie but that couldn't be my favorite movie!great story with great actors but with a terrible end... to make you cry and say 'oh, she's so good'... still, who made it? what really happened? who's that guy? no answer to these questions...mysterious movie with a good mark overall... i give it a 8/10, going on the 8.5!

i loved the movie, but like everyone said, there were some bits that weren't developed enough. i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison; sure, they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still...i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have. for example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking.then, there are some parts that were very ambiguous. i think it's pretty much understood that danes' character didn't do it, but i can see how that could be confusing. also, why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk? i thought it was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing.apart from that, the movie was great. i cried when claire danes took the blame; she's a great actress.also, i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked. talk about lack of closure...

brokedown palace is the story of two best friends, alice and darlene, who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage. in this way, the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, such as "return to paradise", but instead, the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship.claire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances, and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life (which is a bit glossed over), and focuses more on these friendship issues.there were some plot holes here, and some parts that just didn't seem believable or realistic. we didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have. and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls, with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. in short, this should, by all rights, have been a much darker movie than it was.but overall, i enjoyed it. the acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. worth seeing.

two adventurous teenagers, best friends, take a trip to thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college. it seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land, until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to hong kong and puts drugs in their luggage. they get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in asia is very different from justice in the u.s.this is the main story line for "brokedown palace" and it was a good one. the film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations. actually, the portrayal was rather mild, as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted. it serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is, it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world.unfortunately, there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story. the whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy. to think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra, and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors, assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheads.the story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in alice's (claire danes) backpack. did she actually agree to transport the drugs? we are left to guess. it was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the film, but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty. except for this considerable flaw, the ending was excellent and the results unexpected.the acting by claire danes and kate beckinsale was very solid and well done. danes, who has been oversold and over hyped, actually arrived as an actor in this film. though her portrayal was frequently immature (as was her character), she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire. beckinsale, in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody-two-shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison. her's was the best performance in the film.bill pullman was miscast as the lawyer. his wry and diffident style is an asset in films like "while you were sleeping", but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality.the tourist's look at thailand was interesting, but it didn't make me want to go there.overall, an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes. i gave it a 7/10.

i have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now. brokedown palace has that `hard to believe' aspect, however with the ingenious directing, and screenplay, palace scores big.  i've really never enjoyed watching claire danes in any of her movies, but i'll tell you what, she really changed my mind with this one. kate beckinsale joins danes on a vacation to thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to hong kong with him. however, he neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him. well, ultimately they get caught, and end up in a thailand prison. i know, i know, how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? well if you can get by that one tiny miscue, you will find a very well written, and acted out story. lately i have found myself getting drawn into the storylines of the movies i watch, and developing a personal feeling for the characters that i watch. this movie is no different. by the end of the movie i found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film.  bill pullman plays hank green, an attorney who lives in thailand and specializes in international relations. as always pullman delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully.  there are a few twists and turns that will, by the end of the movie, have you in tears. this is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home. it is my opinion that the next time out at the video store, do not pass by this one again.

i saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly impressed by it. then again, that was when claire danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, hollywood-ized bitch she is today. anyway, this film really struck me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendship films. how far would you really go for your best friend? i was moved to tears at the end, and still tear up when i watch it now (i own it). i remember as soon as i left the theater, i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her. this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend. however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you'd do something like that for her....

i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend. i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn't feel very good.i ended up liking it big time. it's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug traffic, and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail.the acting is on it's prime level. two of the women that i lust the most star and that's a good thing. claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance. bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities.there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience. plus it shows the difficult times at thailand.this is an underrated movie. not many films like this one have come up in recent history. it should make you reflex about many things...

while i do not think this was a perfect 10, i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it's rated here. no, brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments. the acting of claire danes, as already mentioned many times, was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(pullman's wife, the crooked cop, skip or trip or whatever his name is). the cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major ones that i found) as well.here is what i didn't like about it-the friendship between the girls-in fact, the girls' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film. that, however, is not my major problem. and warning-spoiler alert.the ending as mentioned dozens of times already, was awful. it was awful in two respects. firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood, i wanted a happy ending! yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that. i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or, barring that, at least the cop should have got what was coming to him. i mean nothing happens to the bad guys, they all get away with it. very disturbing.also, i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. i understand endings that are inspired to make one think, but this was not a mystery or "clue" type movie we were watching, and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened,who was guilty etc, with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel, i did not want to be kept guessing.still, there was a lot to like about this movie, and the acting is definitely at the top of the list,i would rate this a 7.5 and say it is definitely worth a look.

i caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it's entirety and i'm glad i did. i was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved. naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named nick who get them into serious trouble. they are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring. taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble. everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their american lawyer "yankee hank". hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by alice(claire dane). however, the thai native wife of hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized. the end of the movie when alice does a selfless act to save darlene (beckinsale) had me in tears. i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.

i like films that don't provide the typical "happy ending," and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie. alice marano (danes) and her best friend darlene (beckinsale) are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities. the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether (or which) of the girls was involved, and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer. jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind, magnanimous wife, yon, who is also an attorney. i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison, as another commenter has suggested, as i've heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal. where this film grabs me, however, is its ending. alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned, and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent. any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me, and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving.

in the film "brokedown palace," directed by jonathan kaplan, two best friends, alice (claire danes) and darlene (kate beckinsale) decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to hawaii, but hear that bangkok, thailand, is much more fun. they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans. while they were in thailand, alice and darlene met a really handsome guy named nick parks (daniel lapaine). he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong. they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs. they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison. i think kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever. also, a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face. those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever. things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made. sometimes life is not fair, that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made.this movie has a great setting; it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand. this film also has great music; a few of my favorite songs are 'silence' by delerium, 'damaged' by plumb, 'deliver me' by sarah bightman and 'party's just begun' by nelly furtado. i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film. these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly, a mistake that anyone could make, therefore this film is good for any audience. it makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes. even though, i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of --who really smuggled the drugs? -- i would definitely give this film two thumbs up.

we all have friends. some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with, people that you can say are like your brother or sister. alice ( danes )and darlene ( beckinsale ) are like that. you can see that from the beginning. they graduated together, they go to parties together and they decide to go to bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to hawaii. they also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster. the rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope. it also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone.brokedown palace is a very good film, it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about. but first i want to say what is good about the film. and for starters the acting is top notch, and you can look no further than the two leads. danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have. alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges, but she seems more fun than darlene. but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble. darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes, it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of alice's. bill pullman is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand. the film is photographed very well also. the inside of the prison while not the same as shawshank or natural born killers or return to paradice, but it does show the necessary ( but underdone) hopelessness of the situation that they are in. johnathin kaplan's direction is quite good as well. we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day. brokedown palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive. the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film. it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection. the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison. you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life. and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do. we have it easy compared to some country's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject. some of the music is done by a group called delirium ( i think ) but it is sara mclaughlin( wrong spelling, but how do you spell her last name? ) that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film.what i didn't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit. i won't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you'll know what i am talking about. also i didn't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad. it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country, the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic. but i didn't get that here.overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question, " how far would you go for a friend? " that is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation. let's just hope that it never comes down to that.

it's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other american movie, and then be surprised when that doesn't happen. i like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic manner, and i thought brokedown palace did this very well.the ending, with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other, thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place, was very moving. i almost rather would have done without the last line, which proved that she didn't actually do the deed she confessed to, because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. whether she did it or not wasn't that important.the story itself bordered on the cliché, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. very realistic, very captivating.7 out of 10.

i love claire danes, and kate beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. the movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some monastery, working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline. the acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be thailand is eye-catching, but claire daines steals the entire movie, and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end, in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. the flaws are minute and i recommend the film, which seems buried sadly forever to rare tv showings. i for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only "10" rated films. watch it, you will be very touched.

"what would you do?" is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional brokedown palace. you will also be left wondering if alice (danes) was telling the truth or not - a issue that is left unresolved, and rightly so. this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film. although it is slow at times, its pace is reflective of the story line - but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next. the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters, which are brilliantly played by kate beckinsale and claire danes. bill pullman's performance is commendable, too.

this movie is cold, bare truth. often we think "oh no, that won't happen to me." but it can. drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly (or tricked) into doing things for smugglers. the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, only wanted a exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. people need to know that these sort of events aren't improbable or exaggerated - this is a major problem in today's society.i would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie. it is very emotional and raw. well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory.

alice(claire danes) and darlene(kate beckinsale) have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand. due to a incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend. but at the airport, alice and darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison. now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship. this was a pretty good movie, i've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained. claire danes did a great job as usual, she is a great actress. i would give brokedown palace 8/10

brokedown palace is truly a one of a kind. it's an amazing story, showing two girl's plight for freedom against the thailand justice system. they soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about.alice morano (claire danes) and darlene davis (kate beckinsale), are two best friends, strait out of high school. they suddenly change their vacation plans from hawaii to thailand, and are immediately captivated by a young man, nick parks. he flirts with them both, and suggests that the three of them go to hong kong for the weekend.when the two arrive at the airport, they are immediately searched for drugs. someone tipped off customs, and in an instant, their life is changed forever. in the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life, they learn about a highly respected lawyer, named hank green (bill pullman).an american who knows the thai justice system, he fights for the girl to be free. but they soon find out, when they leave or go is all up to them.if you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years - brokedown palace is definitely the way to go.

i saw this movie a million years (5 years to be exact) ago for the first the time. in the light of recent events with the australian woman schapelle corby being imprisoned in indonesia for so called smuggling pot, i decided to watch this movie again. i excepted to cry my heart out, 'cause i'm sucker for hot girls in need (just read my review of 'the stalking of laurie show'). some moist escaped my eyes, but it were hardly buckets filled with tears. why? not because the two heroines weren't utterly adoring and helpless, not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions. why then? why did i not cry? i wanted to cry! when i rent a movie like this, i except to be moved, to sob like there's no tomorrow, to feel miserable and like it. this movie was simply too short to do this. it was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements, and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside. clare danes and kate beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends, but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing (and oppressing) surroundings. the mental journey is missing here for some reason. you only get to see the key moments of it (which are very touching, i admit), probably because of bad editing. sometimes i felt these girls were walking around in a postcard. the relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention. what's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents (especially between alice and her dad)? you catch a glimpse of it, but the film doesn't quite offer the whole picture, sadly enough.nonetheless this was a great movie, and at the end i even had to bite my lip a bit. but i guess this has more to do with the acting skills (and the looks) of the actresses (and the music) then with the merit of the director. to be honest, i hardly knew who kate beckinsale was before i watched this movie (again). now, i am a fan! great movie, as long as you don't expect it to be classic cinema.

i saw this movie by luck, just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did! this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites! the story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom.alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story. the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense. the acting is amazing, the images extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful. i actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it. i know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear, this one, you have to see!!! i promise it will stick with you!

i saw this film at a store in the cheap section. i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago. i thought "what the hey' and bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes (this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fan).so it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in bangkok, get busted for narcotics (which they are innocent of) and then are sent to a thailand prison. the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence.both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally, and raises some nice moral discussion questions.i think this is a solid good film, but there could have been some improvements. it could have been longer...it would've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of thailand's justice system would've helped.nevertheless, other than that, it's a good film with some great performances.p.s. for all you pop-culture junkies be on the lookout for a two-minute role by paul walker. i didn't even notice him the first time i saw the film.

finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen. well, we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers, andy (played by hoffman) and hank (played by hawke) will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down, but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie. hoffman is superb, as usual, and even hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself. hawke might have been a little out of his element, but he played the part well enough. add into this mix andy's wife, played perfectly by marisa tomei, cheating with hank; andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery. this movie will get you thinking.

thank god this wasn't based on a true story, because what a story it is. populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, before the devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren't carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn't hurt either.the main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.the story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: "charlie: two days before the robbery", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life. throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to gina (marisa tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from albert finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you've got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hands. proceed with caution.

watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema. i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me, the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience. it is one of those films that has stayed with me, and i continue to ponder and think about it.surely the dvd would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements? which include: sidney lumet's comeback movie, the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling, the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well, the masterly direction, the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women, the under-presented, but nevertheless resonant marisa tomei's performance, and, of course, the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie.phew! surely a masterful film. so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd - only to find no commentary, no behind-the-scenes, no interviews, no extras.hey - distributors - sort it out!

'before the devil knows you're dead' is one of the best movies i've seen in along time. the acting fromthe excellent ensemble cast is incredible. philip seymour hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he's on screen. ethan hawke matches him scene for scene and albert finney simply chews up the screen. marisa tomei is, however,criminally underused, but looks amazing for her 42 years. the script is excellent, the story-line non-linear but easy enough to follow. sidney lumet, although not known for his blockbusters, has turned out a gem with this one!

this intensely involving 2007 character-driven suspense drama is like a big, juicy piece of shakespearean-level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious, to-the-edge performances from his actors. consider for starters - henry fonda's lone dissenting juror in "twelve angry men", katharine hepburn's delusional mary tyrone in "long day's journey into night", rod steiger's conflicted concentration camp survivor in "the pawnbroker", william holden's wintry lion in "network", and paul newman's alcoholic lawyer in "the verdict". the list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half-century, and you can safely add philip seymour hoffman's desperately controlling andy hanson to the ranks. at 83, director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue, and in fact, he revels in the melodramatic turns of first-time screenwriter kelly masterson's thickly plotted script.the scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash. woody allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film, the oddly pinched "cassandra's dream", but lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception. the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless. embezzling funds from his real estate company's payroll to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit, smooth-talking andy is about to be exposed in an irs audit. meanwhile, his younger brother hank is a mass of post-divorce, codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments.andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there. the goal was for the brothers to collect the haul, and the parents to claim the insurance. murphy's law intervenes in every possible way starting with andy pressuring hank to do the job himself. after some brotherly cajoling, hank agrees to it, but too scared to do it alone, he recruits a reckless, gun-toting busboy to handle the robbery. by fate, the heist occurs on the one day that andy and hank's mother is opening the shop, and things quickly spiral out of control from there. although the back-and-forth storytelling technique is not new (for example, alejandro gonzález iñárritu's "21 grams"), masterson's approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event.the acting is pitch-perfect starting with hoffman's riveting performance as andy, a machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family. i thought he was great in tamara jenkins' "the savages", but he is even better here. lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable ethan hawke as hank, imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill-planned move. as their embattled father, albert finney acts with his typical late-career bluster, but he provides the necessary foundation for the oedipal-level complexities. marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina, as the actress economically keys in on the responsive, watchful nature of a small but pivotal role. the estimable theater veteran rosemary harris (now better known as peter parker's aunt in the "spider-man" trilogy) has precious little time as the mother, as does amy ryan as hank's bitter ex-wife.there are scenes that border on excessive, especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers, but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable. after the disappointment of the cartoonish "find me guilty", it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here. the 2008 dvd offers terrifically informative commentary from lumet, hoffman and hawke, all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout. along with the original theatrical trailer, there is also a better-than-average 24-minute featurette, "directed by sidney lumet: how the devil was made", which features on-set footage and snippets of interviews with lumet, two of the producers and the principal actors.

the humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the sunday school dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you're dead for the devil's scrutiny, i.e. so the devil doesn't care when you're dead. there's no percentage in trying to beat the devil. the characters apparently didn't pay attention at sunday school, and find themselves forced into crisis management, having eschewed crisis avoidance. but even a seasoned ceo would have difficulty managing these crises. throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable sidney lumet films. until now, hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other lumet all stars like steiger and pacino.

this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong. a simple robbery. pick up some serious change. get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory. butmom and pop's jewelry store? no problem. insurance pays for it all. no guns. nobody gets hurt. easy money.older, more successful (it would appear) brother andy (philip seymour hoffman) has a few minor problems. heroin addiction, cocaine habituation. a wife (marisa tomei) thatwell, he can't seem to perform for. his flat belly days long gone. younger, sweet, slightly dim-witted younger brother, hank (ethan hawke) with a few dinero problems of his own. behind in child support payments for his daughter, in debt to friends and relatives, not exactly wowing them in the work of work, etc.sydney lumet, in this performance at the age of 82 (!), directs and gets it 99.99 percent right, which is hard to do in a thriller. i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes, the improbabilities, the cheesy scenes, and the hurry-up ending. here lumet makes a thriller like it's a work of art. every detail is perfect. the acting is superb. the plot has no holes. the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself.hoffman of course is excellent. when you don't have marquee, leading man presence, you have to get by on talent, workmanship and pure concentration. ethan hawke, who is no stranger to the sweet, little guy role, adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him. albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age. and marisa tomei, who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity, manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andy's two timing wife. (but who could blame her?) it's almost a movie reviewer's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars, but if you study this film, as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do, you will notice the kind of excessive (according to most hollywood producers) attention to detail that makes for real art--the sort of thing that only great artists can do, and indeed cannot help but do. (by the way, i think there were twenty producers on this filmwell, maybe a dozen; check the credits.) all i can say in summation is, way to go sydney lumet, author of a slew of excellent films, and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos. may we all do half so well.okay, the 00.01 percent. it was unlikely that the father (albert finney) could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail. this is minor, and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip. also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end. we can guess and guess. perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor. perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out, and he just said, "leave it like that. it really doesn't matter." and i think it doesn't. what happens to hank is not going to be good. he isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life. he is the kind of guy who gets a "light" sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been.see this for sidney lumet, one of hollywood's best, director of the pawnbroker (1964), the group (1966), serpico (1973), dog day afternoon (1975), network (1976), and many more.

the beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing , but sit tight, because you are in for the ride of your life. the concept is compelling, with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story. there are fine performances all around, with phillip seymour hoffman's being the best of the cast-no surprise there. ethan hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. the direction by mr. lumet is outstanding. the film has a seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs. you will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film.

i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet. the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane. it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end. trust me, this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through.the story is very well crafted and almost brilliant. it's almost like a more complicated tarantino type story. the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts, excellent cast. i also loved the cinematography, it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film. it was all great.this movie is excited, exhausting and heartbreaking. it's almost hard to watch but you'll be glad that you did.

if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good. i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (the english patient, shakespeare in love, atonement, crash. this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end. acting is great, story is absolutely original, flash-back technique very affective. there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him, but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to, rather than a rip-off of, orson.

i watched this film in a very strange way -- i had put it on my netflix list and couldn't remember why (other than that i knew philip seymour hoffman was in it). since the film has no opening credits, i couldn't even remember who had directed it.as my wife and i watched it, i turned to her about 45 minutes in and said, "you know, i keep wanting to decide that i hate this film, but something about it just won't let me stop watching it." then there's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors' performances.it was only as the end credits rolled that i realized it was a sidney lumet film. and i thought -- wow. i'm surprised that lumet took on what was really a dirty, petty little story about really mean, broken people. but it's a testament to his talent that i was so taken in when i didn't even realize it was him.philip seymour hoffman is really, really good in this movie. like scary good. put this up against capote and i would argue the oscar should have been for this film instead.i also highly recommend the narrative special feature with lumet, hawke and hoffman talking about making the movie -- it's entertaining and educational, with hawke playing the student eager to learn at the master's feet. lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors -- kiss their asses constantly!!there are a lot of violent, melodramatic movies out there that are empty ciphers when all is said and done. and there is an element of that in this film -- that the actors fill the air with sulphurous blasts of emotion, and when the smoke clears there's nothing left. nothing resonates on a deeper level.but lumet has given us network and twelve angry men -- films that, each in their own ways, have been elevated into the highest echelons of cinema.this movie isn't at that level. but there's something about it that lingers. and maybe that's enough.my final comment is about the comments -- if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on imdb -- and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con -- it's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film.

the hanson brothers - andy (apparently has his act together) and hank (clearly doesn't have his act together) need money. andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole hanson family.this film delivers. this is a layered, full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. as a crime drama / thriller i would happily compare it to 'no country for old men.' while both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills, 'devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'no country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire, while 'devil' is a bit more enjoyable. there is definitely less violence in 'devil' than 'no country.' the acting delivers as well. ethan hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings the jitters, sweating and the deer-in-the-headlights-look to the besieged hank. philip seymour hoffman, as andy, has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor, who you believe can do anything.there's really not much wrong with this film. it jumps back and forth without being confusing. events spiral out of control, but the film never does - the writing (from first timer kelly masterson), directing (veteran sidney lumet) and the editing stay as tight as a drum. in many categories, this is award caliber stuff, though maybe films like 'the departed' and 'no country' squeezed this one out of the limelight. if you liked those, you'll like this.

legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. with an a-list cast headed by philip seymour hoffman (an oscar-worthy performance here), ethan hawke, marisa tomei and albert finney, lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as reservoir dogs, but also family stories such as ordinary people.many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here. instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. i personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next. the script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife hoffman and tomei, as well as between father and son finney and hoffman. all the actors are totally engaging to watch and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment.

while the title "before the devil knows you're dead" comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy. it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they've gotten themselves into.the cast is well-assembled with philip seymour hoffman & ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other. beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable.the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve. the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts. that being said, the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy, through and through. all in all, a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter kelly masterson.sidney lumet's direction is well handled but i'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at over eighty years old. i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it isn't a major distraction.in the end, the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story & presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience.

tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called backstreet that "tragedy is like another character" in the film. the same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up tarantino- for sidney lumet's best work in years, a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what's at stake with the cast involved. kelly masterson doesn't have a masterpiece of a script here (it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end, and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount), but her script does convey character before plot, and in a story where the actions surround a heist it's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat. it's bleak as hell, unforgiving as satan, but also absolutely riveting 90% of the time.chalk it up not just because lumet knows how to handle a non-linear script where we see the day-to-day actions of character to character before during, and mostly after the botched 'mom-&-pop' jewelry store robbery occurs, but because of the formidable cast assembled (which, i might add, is lumet's specialty). philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f***-ups, and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool-proof heist: looting their own mother and father's jewelry store in westchester. hawke's hank involves another shady character though, murders occur, and suddenly it's tragedy on a greek scale affecting the brothers and their father, played by a perfect albert finney. it's the kind of material that most actors love- characters who, like in dog day afternoon, are painfully human, flawed to the bone but only wanting love &/or things to be set right, and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs.in this case though hoffman and hawke are matched splendidly; hoffman has, until the aforementioned last ten minutes, a super-calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation, but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally (i.e. with finney or the car scene with tomei) push his talents to the limit; hawke, meanwhile, is called a loser by his ex-wife and daughter, can't pay any debts at all, and is called a baby by his own father, and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- he's not quite as flawed as his older brother, but who wants to pick a straw for that title? and finney, as mentioned, is spot-on all the way through, making his turn in big fish look like child's play (the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic, his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half).also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two-timing marisa tomei, bug's michael shannon as bad-ass white trash, and amy ryan, brian f. o'byrne and rosemary harris making brief, exact impressions, this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family's perpetual downward spiral. if it's not as mind-blowing as serpico or network or the pawnbroker or 12 angry men it comes as close as anything lumet's done since.

in new york, andy hanson (philip seymour hoffman) is an addicted executive of a real estate office that has embezzled a large amount for his addiction and expensive way of life with his wife gina (marisa tomei). when an audit is scheduled in his department, he becomes desperate for money. his baby brother hank hanson (ethan hawke) is a complete loser that owes three months of child support to his daughter, and is having a love affair with gina every thursday afternoon. andy plots a heist of the jewelry of their parent in a saturday morning without the use of guns, expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parents, since the insurance company would reimburse the loss. on monday morning, we would raise the necessary money he needs to cover his embezzlement. he invites hank to participate, since he is very well known in the mall where the jewelry is located and could be recognized. however, hank yellows and invites the thief bobby lasorda (brian f. o'byrne) to steal the store, but things go wrong when their mother nanette (rosemary harris) comes to work as the substitute for the clerk and bobby brings a hidden gun. nanette reacts and kills bobby but she is also lethally shot. after the death of nanette, their father charles hanson (albert finney) decides to investigate the robbery with tragic consequences."before the devil knows you're dead" is a comedy of errors, disclosing a good story. the originality and the difference are in the screenplay, with a non-linear narrative à la "pulp fiction". the eighty-three year-old sidney lumet has another great work and it is impressive the longevity of this director. philip seymour hoffman is awesome in the role of a dysfunctional man with traumatic relationship with his father that feels the world falling apart mostly because of his insecure and clumsy brother. marisa tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy, showing a magnificent body. the violent conclusion shows that the world is indeed an evil place. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "antes que o diabo saiba que você está morto" ("before the devil knows you're dead")

the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction. two brothers, andy and hank, will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most.andy hanson (philip seymour hoffman) and his younger brother hank (ethan hawke) couldn't be more different. andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina (marisa tomei) who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed. hank, however, is divorcée who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school bills, and endless amount of child support payments. a man who means well and has good intentions, hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it.however, andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better. he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears. the pressure of his life, and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up, have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again. of course, like hank, he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it. how? by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run. this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers, their families, and several other lives, will be destroyed because of greed, pride, and fear. the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told. after the robbery goes wrong, and nanette hanson (rosemary harris) who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed, the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt. we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles (albert finney) to the death of his wife. the relationship between charles and his two sons, especially to andy, is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men. nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story.philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also, in contradictory way, as a man we can sympathize with. ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left. andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions.before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face. more than that, our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected. in what should have been best picture of the year, we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives. in other words, there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse.10/10

sydney lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still got game! a few years ago he shot "find me guilty", a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act, if he gets the opportunity and the right director. if he had retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have blamed him. but he's still going strong, his next movie already announced for 2009.but let's stay with this movie right here. the cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. the little nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing. the (time) structure of the movie, that keeps your toes the whole time, blending time-lines so seamlessly, that the editing seems natural/flawless. the story is heightened by that, although even in a "normal" time structure, it would've been at least a good movie (drama/thriller). i can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! :o)

before the devil knows you're dead starts off promisingly, setting up a simple heist that goes awry, told from varying perspectives (in rashomon style). at around the hour mark, sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts; it eventually morphs into a multi-faceted family drama, exploring the full realm of human emotions/relations, as the story comes to its chilling climax.as is the case with lumet, he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star-studded cast, without any notion of over-acting or hyperbole. philip seymour hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious, and interesting character, and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke, who plays his brother, hank. that's not to say that hawke is not bad; in fact he is quite above adequate, in a troubled role that suits his style. marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this). albert finney's character (andy and hank's father) is the most intriguing, and in my opinion, he deserved a bit more screen-time. amy ryan also performs her job adequately.before the devil knows you're dead is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here, not least of which involves the use of his characters. infused with a killer script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pacing, and a decent score, before the devil knows you're dead is a must-see. a truly underrated gem. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). should just enter my top 250 at 248. highly recommended.

director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces,like network,dog day afternoon or serpico.but,he was not having too much luck on his most recent works.gloria (1999) was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting,but failed experiment.now,lumet brings his best film in decades and,by my point of view,a true masterpiece:before the devil knows you're dead.i think this film is like a rebirth for lumet.this movie has an excellent story which,deeply,has many layers.also,i think the ending of the movie is perfect.the performances are brilliant.philip seymour hoffman brings,as usual,a magnificent performance and he's,no doubt,one of the best actors of our days.ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he's underrated by my point of view.his performance in here is great.the rest of the cast is also excellent(specially,the great albert finney) but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars.the film has a good level of intensity,in part thanks to the performances and,in part,thanks to the brilliant screenplay.before the devil knows you're dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction,a great screenplay and excellent performances.we need more movies like this.

i must admit that this is the type of film that i would normally eschew, but i rented it basically because of the stars. i certainly was not sorry. in fact, as you see, i rated it five stars. this film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting.andy and hank hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store. the crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the hanson family. through a series of flashbacks, we get to know charles hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons.younger brother, hank is basically a screw-up. he has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind. hank is insecure, cowardly, and very much under the influence of his big brother. ethan hawke has the character of hank "nailed to a t" and gives what is probably his best performance thus far. he shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task.andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit. it is andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents' store, and he gets weak-willed hank to commit the act. philip seymour hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays andy. hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath. he is absolutely perfect for the part of andy or it might be said that he, through his superior acting skills, made andy the perfect part.albert finney plays a father common to his generation. charles hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man, but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself. he has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. he always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and andy. as we get to know charles and andy, the thought of andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable.on a personal note, i cannot believe how much charles hanson reminded me of my own father, and how much andy and hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. perhaps this may be one of the reasons that i enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant, critical father, a more successful older brother, and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home. fortunately, my brother and i never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff.this complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director, sidney lumet. at eighty-three, he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes. 12 angry men was his first film made fifty years prior to before the devil knows you're dead, but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered.the events and characters in before the devil knows you're dead are harsh and unattractive, and this is definitely not a feel-good movie. however, it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which i thoroughly recommend.

the full title of this film is 'may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead', a rewording of the old irish toast 'may you have food and raiment, a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven, before the devil knows you're dead.' first time screenwriter kelly masterson (with some modifications by director sidney lumet) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes. in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but, here, very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling. by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale, we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong. andy hanson (philip seymour hoffman) is a wealthy executive, married to an emotionally needy gina (marisa tomei), and addicted to an expensive drug habit. his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money. andy's ne're-do well younger brother hank (ethan hawke) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha (amy ryan), is behind in alimony and child support, and has borrowed all he can from his friends, and he needs money. andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe, quick cash for both. the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - charles (albert finney) and nanette (rosemary harris). andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery, but though hank agrees to the 'fail-safe' plan, he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car. the robbery is horribly botched when nanette, filing in for the regular clerk, shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess. the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies, charles and andy and hank (and their respective partners) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn. each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances, and while we have come to expect that from hoffman, hawke, tomei, finney, ryan, and harris, it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful. it is not an easy film to watch, but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect, a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be. grady harp

i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007's films. if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films, 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales, films that portray, test, challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things. although this identification is rather broad, i think that there are a handful of films released this year, such as 3:10 to yuma, eastern promises, american gangster, no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery. before the devil knows you're dead is a deviously stylish morality tale, and quite a dark, bleak and depressing one at that. and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time, the legendary sidney lumet, who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller.it's one of those films whose plots are so thick, that one is very reluctant to go into details. it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold, as there are twists and turns. but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film; the true focus is, as i mentioned, the morality tale; the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film. in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers (namely blood simple and fargo) and quentin tarantino, we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly, ridiculously wrong, and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy. and to make it all the more interesting, the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time. sizzling, sharp, thick and precariously depressing, kelly masterson's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded, in particular because it is a debut screenplay.but the film has much more going for it than just it's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot. first and foremost, the picture looks and feels outstandingly well. sidney lumet has, throughout his career, consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting: naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time. the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class, with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great. editing is top-notch; combining the sizzling drama-thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly. and vivid, dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style. the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell.the screenplay does its part, and of course lumet does his part, but at the film's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances. first and foremost, there are the two leads. leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman, who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading-man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar-winning performance in capote. his turn in this film is fascinating: severely flawed, broken, manic. hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out, and not just his subtlety and wit. at his side is ethan hawke, who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater, grander actors. here, he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well; in all, the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing, the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it's watching actors. and then there's albert finney. such a supple, opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime. i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out. i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they're middle-aged men; and yet despite this, it is clear how finney's father favours hawke's younger, weaker brother. also on the topic of the cast, the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei, whose looks just get better and better as the years go by.this film isn't revolutionary. these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers, and it's very easy to imagine them directing this film. but for a film that treads familiar ground, it simply excels. lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to masterson's brilliantly vivid, intense, and morbidly depressing first-time screenplay. the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman, hawke and finney; but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar, much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business, sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful, resonant, intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years.

says andy: "nobody gets hurt, everybody wins." before he says it, we know the opposite is true: everybody gets hurt, nobody wins. this is a new strand in american movies, or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last. think "eastern promises", "there will be blood", "no country for old men". these movies are dark, serious, extremely well made, and don't care about happy endings. i love them. "before the devil knows you're dead" fits the general description, but creates an atmosphere all its own. kelly masterson's debut script is as close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy. paying tribute to fellow veteran director stanley donen, sidney lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding, old school character drama. the opening shots, although of an obese accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife, have the look and feel of a dutch master's painting. by contrast, the drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of mondrians. great performances all around. only albert finney's character charles feels a little over-acted, eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time. but then he is in trouble deep, deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know. for compensation, marisa tomei is super hot. but of course you don't need me to tell you that. why her character gina would want to be with a guy like andy, we're never told, but that's okay. action is character, after all. the unique and magic touch of carter burwell's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece. don't miss it.

sydney lumet hasn't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight, well-cast, suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground, new york city. (how he got insurance, let alone the budget after all those flops, is a mystery also). the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene.two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents. the only victim is going to be the insurance company. the robbery goes awry and two people die. most of the film is concerned with the aftermath. the action is non-linear and seen from the main character's differing points of view, but it is not difficult to follow. what is not so easy to work out is the back story  how did the brothers get into such a mess? there are clues  the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers' favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father, and vice versa, but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin-using murdering embezzler.as the scheming older brother, a corpulent philip seymour hoffman dominates the film, but he is well supported by ethan hawke as his bullied, inadequate younger brother. albert finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that. marisa tomei as the older brother's cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance i've seen in many a year. the film literally starts with a bang, but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly.i don't know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter kelly masterton but i suspect that like lumet's great 70's film "dog day afternoon" it is based on fact  it's too silly to be untrue. lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old-time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them. some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys. this isn't a classic of either sort  it's a well-crafted piece of downbeat entertainment. it will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one, but still wondering as to how they got that way. we do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys. (there is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant). well, like tolstoy, we have to conclude that "each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way".

after a cold sex scene, between andy and gina, in south america, we know that andy is a payroll manager who finds himself in a hard economic situation where he badly needs some extra money we also discover that he has been stealing from his job and using the money to his drug habits he's also attempting to keep up with his wife, who just might be having an affair to solve all their problems, he persuades his brothera likable loserto join him in a plan to steal their own parent's small store their parents are happily married and proprietors of a jewelry store situated in new york's westchester county sixty thousand dollars is all they'll need to get their life out of desperation three main characters are important in this moviefirst the two brothers each of them is a complex individual, threatened with multiple motivations, and sunk into doubts and disappointments the two are desperate characters, financially and emotionallyandy is selfish he feels that he has never had the love of his father he is the corrupting influence, turning his brother into an assailant, and his beautiful woman into an adulteresshank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishes his ex-wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child support. he longs to regain the confidence he once had with his father the third character is their weary and deplorable father charles hanson (albert finney), especially in the haunting climactic scenestelling you more about the details could lessen the impact of the film, and therefore the entertainment...tomei's performance conveys great depth and emotion even with her look, her touch, her particular movelumet's direction is firm, fresh and brutal.

what an extraordinary crime thriller!! my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival. it's already my second favourite film of all-time after dr. strangelove and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wife.i don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions. a synopsis that i'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers, played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke, are planning to rob a jewellery store in westchester, new york. the film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time (before, during and after the robbery), and one key scene is repeated at least three times. ordinarily, that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece. the excitement, the tension, and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed. by the end, i was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up. i know that i've used a few clichés in this post, but i literally was on the edge of my seat. i should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow. this isn't the sort of movie where you'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.the acting is absolutely brilliant all-around, and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect. a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke don't look like brothers, but that's a minor quibble that i can easily overlook. hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric. marisa tomei (as hoffman's wife) and albert finney (as the father of hoffman & hawke) are also very good in supporting roles. even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark, gesture and facial expression by brian o'byrne and michael shannon  absolute perfection. the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene i've ever watched, and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes, especially the ones with hoffman. the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie, often the same notes played over very effectively. i had the music playing in my head the following day, even as i sat through other films. in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph, there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable (major spoiler, so i can't describe the scene). otherwise, this film is pretty darn close to perfect.there were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows you're dead stands in a league of its own. as an aside, the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage. tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked "can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy?" that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene!!

two dysfunctional brothers (philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke) get tired of competing for who is the bigger f***-up and who daddy (albert finney) loves more, so they hatch a hair-brained scheme to rob mommy and daddy's jewelry store so that they can clear their debts and start fresh. sounds like a great plan except that this is a suspenseful 1970's style melodrama about a heist gone wrong, and boy, do things really go wrong here for our hapless duo and everyone involved. lasciviously concocted by screenwriter kelly masterson and classically executed by director sidney lumet, "before the devil knows you're dead" uses the heist as its mcguffin to delve deep into family drama.contrary to popular belief, sidney lumet is not dead. at age 83, he has apparently made a deal with the devil to deliver one last great film. lumet was at his zenith in the 1970's with films like "dog day afternoon," "serpico," and one of my favorite films of all time, "network". he has somehow managed to make a film that bears all the hallmarks of his classics while intertwining some more modern elements (graphic sexuality, violence, and playing with time-frames and pov's) into a crackling, vibrant, lean, mean, and provocative melodrama. one can only hope that some of the modern greats (like scorsese or spielberg) who emerged during the same decade lumet was at the top of his game will have this much chutzpah left when they reach that age.lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters. as the cast waltzes through finely appointed manhattan offices and apartments his slowly moving camera creates a palpable sense of anxiety as we never know who might be around the next corner or what this person might do in the next room. also amazing is how lumet utilizes the multiple pov and shifting time-frame approach. the coherent and classical presentation he uses makes the similarly structured films of wunderkinds christopher nolan and alejandro gonzalez inarritu seem like amateur hour.of course, what lumet is best at is directing amazing ensemble casts and tricking them into acting within an inch of their lives. philip seymour hoffman has never been, and most likely never will be, better than he is here. albert finney's quietly searing portrayal of a father betrayed and at the end of his rope is a masterpiece to watch unfold. ethan hawke, normally a nondescript pretty boy, is perfect as the emotionally crippled younger brother who has skated by far too long on his charms and looks. the coup-de-grace, however, is the series of scenes between hoffman and marisa tomei, eerily on point as his flighty trophy wife. lumet runs them through the gamut of emotions that culminate in a scene that is the best of its kind since william holden taunted beatrice straight right into a best supporting actress oscar in "network." the devil of any great film is in the details, from albert finney's tap of his car's trunk that won't close due to a fender bender, to the look amy ryan (fresh off her amazing turn in "gone baby gone") gives her ex-husband ethan hawke at his mawkish promise to his little girl all three of them knows he won't keep, to the systematic unraveling of a family on the skids, to the dialog begging for cultists to quote it (my favorite line being the hilariously threatening "do you mind if i call you chico?") to the excellent carter burwell score. "before the devil knows you're dead" is the film of the year. if something emerges to best it, then we know a few other deals must've been brokered with old scratch.

i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy. i wasn't sure i would like him this way. and i wasn't sure he could pull it off. but this astounded me. he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people. the movie is engrossing and fast paced. bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy. the real talent here is thomas. the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that's the way real people would fight... if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad!

what great locations. a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens.this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days. good going folks!. i can not wait to see what your next feature will be. i'll be with you all the way.

savage island's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you! trust me.when the boy of the estranged savage family is run over by some city slicker tourists, pa savage wants revenge, and he'll stop at nothing until he gets it.this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments.also, the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film. the filmmakers chose the lighting and camera-work in order to reflect the dark, murky, and egdy mood of the story; in other words, to obtain a certain aesthetic. in fact, the film has won several horror film festival awards.

this is a good film for 99% of the duration. i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim.it is shot in a rather naive fashion. this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique.the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called joe. however, the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott.the film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacks of 'b' movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur. this is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence.after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed. i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film.give it a watch and excuse the ending!

i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it. it actually exceeded my expectations. considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways, especially given the plot. just like the blair witch project, this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film. another bonus: whereas most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre-to-unintentionally hysterical acting, this film actually had a talented cast (save one or two characters), particularly the two leads. the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline. it borrows heavily from better-known films like "deliverance" and "wrong turn" but if you're like me, films of this nature never cease to be terrifying. plus, the director keeps things interesting throughout. i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out...

very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.the script was very good as was the acting. the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film. this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending. i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever. this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good.

this movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style, and extremely worthy of stay alive. for me, it is he best example of film noire since chinatown.it will, unfortunately, never get the recognition it deserves. it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like vanguard cinema and word of mouth rental referrals.i highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot.

i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, i wondered if it was an independent film, and i was correct, but with a good cast i decided to chance it. basically drifter michael williams (nicolas cage) is in the town red rock, wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner wayne brown (pleasantville's j.t. walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle). he does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. when wayne knows his real identity, he chases michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas (dennis hopper). but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. he goes back to suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. before they leave however, suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and wayne and lyle catch up to them, and lyle forces them and now tied-up wayne to go and get the buried money. in the end, lyle and wayne both get what they deserve, michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. also starring craig reay as jim, vance johnson as mr. johnson, timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack, dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard. the performances, apart from maybe a lame boyle, are all fine and dandy, and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. very good!

one thing i always liked about robert ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely different direction. there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching.one thing i also like about director john dahl (kill me again, rounders, unforgettable) is that he can be depended upon to direct and, in this case, write (with his brother rick) a good story.now, add nick cage, dennis hopper, lara flynn boyle, and j.t. walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected. dahl seems to bring out the best in folks, and this will keep you interested, and guessing, until the very end.

red rock west is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next. nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work. dennis hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better. look for a brief appearance by country singing star dwight yoakam. this is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments. what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!

like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing - the 1940s noir films - but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past. the term 'neo-noir' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact. john dahl's film on the other hand, truly deserved to be described as such. the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur. the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes. james m. cain would have appreciated it. many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them like they used to, and i'm not even that old. movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past.

this modern film noir with its off beat humour and dizzying succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises, dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish. it's impossible not to empathise with the honest, unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in, so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride.the story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir. the same is true of the themes of murder, deceit, corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout. many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present, such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit, the rain soaked roads at night, the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow (created by louvred doors) across people's faces.michael williams (nicolas cage), an injured war veteran without money or a job, stops off at a bar in red rock, wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor wayne brown (j t walsh) for a hit man that he's arranged to employ to murder his wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle). michael, a naturally reticent person, does nothing to disabuse wayne of his misapprehension, especially as he could use a job and at first doesn't realise what he'd be expected to do. after having been told what his mission is and been given a $5,000 advance, he goes to see suzanne and warns her about wayne's plan. she doesn't seem overly concerned about the danger she's in and offers michael double the fee wayne had offered, for him to eliminate her husband.michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town. his plan fails however, when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries. at the hospital, things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is suzanne's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach. this leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that wayne is the sheriff!! from this point on, things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man, lyle from dallas (dennis hopper) arrives on the scene."red rock west" has some great moments of suspense, (an example of this is the scene in which michael makes his escape from wayne's bar) and also some great performances from its very strong cast. nicolas cage's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety, surprise or uncertainty and j t walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who's always concealing more than he's actually saying. dennis hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer (a role he plays with great gusto) and lara flynn boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale. dwight yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver.incredibly, "red rock west" was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is.

before nicholas cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. this lesser-known movie is where cage gives one of his best performances. "red rock west" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my favorite movies of all time. i discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see cage and hopper (who also is great in the movie) appear together. go get this one, and i'm sure you won't be disappointed.

this is a 'sleeper'. it defines nicholas cage. the plot is intricate and totally absorbing. the ending will blow you away.see it whenever you have the opportunity.

a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad. a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a twin peaks-ish influence in director dahl. nicholas cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do. j.t. walsh (rip to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is dennis hopper. it's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz. i'm sure he has his followers, though. in all, this is a great film that shows you that you don't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film.

dahl seems to have been under the influence of wenders' the american friend. innocent nick cage gets recruited for a hit. dennis hopper plays a real hit man. lara flynn boyle is dangerous. the hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself. and small town america does not seem all that safer than the big city. like it's predecessor mentioned above, this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable, but all lead to the cathartic self discovery.

the more i watch nicholas cage, the more i appreciate him as an actor. watching this movie now (in 2005), i can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s. i don't really think it can be considered a film noir, but it is pretty dark at times, due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters.typical performances from each of the three main actors, who all did a good job with their roles. i thought, however, that hopper and boyle's characters were left undeveloped, as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy. the plot is really good, and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic, there were parts where i had to hand it to the director (i.e. when he first sees the sheriff). all in all, this movie is definitely worth watching. ***1/2

a lovely old - fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between alfred hitchcock and david lynch,"red rock west" follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker mr n.cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond. it has been established right from the start that mr cage might be down but he is not out,and he might be broke but he will not steal,not even in his present dire circumstances.consequently when he is mistaken by mr j.t. walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife,mr cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions.in turn she,in the person of miss l.f.boyle, offers him even more money to murder mr walsh.mr cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road.tempted as he might be to drive on,he takes the man to hospital,where it turns out he has been shot.mr cage is detained by the deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be mr j.t.walsh. events take a further complicated turn when,escaping from custody,mr.cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit-man on his way to fulfill his commission.about now you might be forgiven for thinking "enough already",but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events,the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable. mr d.hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer,like mr cage a usmc veteran.this little piece of serendipity keeps mr cage alive long enough out-think the murderous trio and survive,a little more battered but still unbowed. it is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round. "red rock west" is a movie - lover's movie.within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you've been before on plenty of occasions,but you'll be very happy during the trip.

a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town, leading to all kinds of complications. cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town. hopper does what he does best, playing a psycho known as "lyle from dallas," the real hit man. walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast. the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns, and john's direction creates a terrific "neo noir" atmosphere. witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up.

red rock west is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore. it's well paced, well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre.nicolas cage stars as michael, an unemployed texas roughneck, desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to wyoming for potential employment. he is honest to a fault, but always on the dark side of fate.after failing to obtain gainful employment, michael stumbles into the red rock bar where the owner wayne (j.t.walsh) mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from dallas, hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle).wayne gives michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous suzie. with no intent on following through, michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn suzanne of her impending demise. he also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits.as fate would dictate, michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy. while leaving in a violent rainstorm, he runs down suzannes lover. of course michael being michael, he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot.the sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it, wayne is also the local law. michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real "lyle from dallas" played with murderous glee by the quirky dennis hopper. after discovering that they're fellow marines, lyle insists that michael join him for a drink at, where else, the red rock bar. there wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and lyle are in hot pursuit of michael who falls willingly into suzannes waiting arms.as the pace picks up we learn that wayne and suzanne are really wanted armed robbers, on the lam for a multi million dollar theft. getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders.the film was very well cast. nicolas cage was typically low key, dennis hopper and lara flynn bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability. the best performance was by the late j.t. walsh who was menacing without appearing to be. walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon.marc reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development. the film was further enhanced by john dahl's tight directorial style and morris chestnut's rapid fire editing.

from the director of movies 'last seduction' and 'kill me again', comes another movie in the noir style. john dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery, blackmailing in the early 90s. though i did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction. but nowadays mr dahl has resorted to directing television shows.its a shame since the man had talent.***spoilers** this is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter cage) that comes in to the town of wyoming for a job. however he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit-man from texas by bar owner j.t walsh. he is given the task to kill his wife (boyle). but cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it. on the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road, who he then takes back to the local hospital. at that point cage coincidently meets walsh again, who also appears to be the local sheriff. after that cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit-man that happens to be dennis hopper.john dahl has co-written and directed this movie. therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen. the direction is of good standard, however while watching the movie i got a made for tv movie feeling. there were too many close up frames. however this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience. the movie had good pace and the structure was perfect. dahl written the script with good duration of lenght.cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically, though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained. his facial expressions were on the mark. lara flynn boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale. her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees. hopper played his part well. but i feel he was miscast for this role. he did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man. the role was not written keeping his personality in mind.while viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like 'the hot spot' and 'a perfect murder'. due to the fact that some sub plots are similar. overall if you are a fan of noir movies, then this one is for you. worth recommending. 7/10

an excellent example of "cowboy noir", as it's been called, in which unemployed michael (nicolas cage) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest (he's got a bum leg). with really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he's going to lie. when he walks into a bar, and the owner wayne (the late, great j.t. walsh) mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle in fine form), michael plays along and accepts waynes' money. *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions, and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne! if that didn't complicate things enough, the real hit-man, "lyle from dallas" (dennis hopper, in a perfect role for him) shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before."red rock west" gets a lot out of the locations. director john dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother rick, was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes. it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation. it's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt, have at least been morally compromised like michael. the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing. even if the writing isn't particularly "logical or credible", the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in.cage does a good job in the lead, but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters. hopper, boyle, and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts. timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies (in one especially good twist, walsh is also the local sheriff), and there's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam, who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune.it's quite a good little film worth checking out. it moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else is certainly never boring.8/10

red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget. all you need is a smart script, good actors and loads of atmosphere. rrw delivers all these and more.nic cage plays an ex-marine, injured in lebanon, who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee. he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne (jt walsh, not quite as his most menacing-but still evil) for a hit-man from texas.he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary. only when he gets there, just to check her out. she offers him double to kill wayne. cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be. but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo-yoing in and out of red rock, back and forth. eventually this leads to a run-in with lyle from dallas (a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper), the real hit-man from texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated.rrw never had a big release, thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings. viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it's bigger than that. the slick, slowly-timed direction, moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtv.the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke-ish hairdo. i certainly wouldn't fall for her but if you assume that nic cage's character is in to militant lesbians then you'll accept it nonetheless.

what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that, while perhaps lacking in substance, still provides great entertainment throughout it's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do. i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl - a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction, rounders and roadkill. i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i've already seen from the director, it would be well worth watching - and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of. the plot focuses on the overly moral michael; a man travelling across america looking for work. he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county - only catch is that the job is to murder a man's wife. he's been mistaken for a killer named lyle, but instead of doing the job; he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway. however, his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up...john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road; he did it three years earlier with kill me again, and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill. it's not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location, as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one. dahl also provides his film with a 'film noir' like atmosphere, as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters. the acting is largely very good, with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role, and getting a-class support from lara flynn boyle, j.t. walsh and, of course, dennis hopper; who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance. it has to be said that the second half of the film isn't as gripping as the first, but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it. overall, red rock west is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching. it's thrilling throughout, and you can't ask for much more than that!

as others have commented, i checked this out after siskel and ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year. what a gift. i then went out to buy it, just so that i could loan it out.best quote? dwight yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (cage) is on top of his cab. when cage peers down, he apologizes. "i'm sorry if i scared you." yoakum thrusts his pistol in cage's face with "does this look like i'm scared?" great bit of humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape.there really was a sense of fun to this. the constant sighting of the "welcome to red rock" sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake. the music created a hunting, eerie quality to the film reminiscent of "twin peaks". unlike "twin peaks", though, it doesn't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish, needing to "top" itself.i admit watching the credits 15-20 times. you see, they had yoakum's "thousand miles from nowhere" (perfectly chosen) playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor . . with snow-capped mountains in the distance. this was incredible, fluid framing. further, i've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film. also, it totally fit the story.

much to your presumable happiness fair readers, cage and hopper did meet and fortunately not in a lynch moviebecause red rock west is way better than any lynch movie . nicolas cage is a thirdrate actor, the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal, only daddy hopper is as mean as ever . red rock west is, despite the trite cast, one of my favorite american thrillers; in a word, a thriller with some twists.one notices mainly the gusto, the awesome pace, the thrills, the nice suspense, lara flynn boyle's cute tight small ass, cage's enviable physical shape (though undeniably ugly, with sharp, bird features, thick eyebrows and thin, rare hair, cage displayed a fine overall shape ), hopper's consummate routine, some moderately but truly funny moments, cage's play with his intended persona, hopper's rigid, psychopathic allure, lara's meanness, cage seems a roamer, the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema, hungry, tough if needed, naive, dirty, tired. lara flynn boyle performs as the cold mean seductress, walsh as her heartless husband, and hopper as the lynchian hit-man he's already done before.cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover. but this might be his regular look.

red rock west (1993)nicolas cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it, and the dominos lead to increasing peril, adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn american west of the 1990s. red rock west is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease. is the plot over the top? yes. is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed, almost likable killer? yes. does cage stand a chance? well, you have to watch and see. it never lets up, and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it. on second viewing yesterday, i was surprised at how well it held up, how well constructed it was, and how macabre and funny it was at the same time.director ron dahl (who also helped write) is known more for his tv work, but with rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots. it's saved by its humor by the way, and by the caricatures. the bar is sleazy, the cops questionable. and don't miss a really inspired cameo by dwight yoakam as a truck driver.

this movie started me on a nick cage kick. it is a story full of twists and turns- a movie of motives and moves. of, course, dennis hopper was a ham, but j.t. walsh and laura flyyn boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web. everything about this movie is good - cinematography, story pace and most of all the end. cage excels at what he does best- it's not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life.

dennis hopper and jt walsh steal the show here. cage and boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is hopper's creepy, violent character and jt walsh's sneakiness.a drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man, and tries to make a little dough out of it, but gets in over his head.i found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie, when cage walks into a trailer in wyoming to get drilling work, with the help of his buddy...and the opening scene in brokeback mountain, when the character does the same thing! but that's another story.dennis hopper is at his best here...cocky, one-step-ahead villainous, seething and explosively violent. jt walsh (rip) is also great as the man with a dark past, trying to live legitimately (well, almost).there are only 4 real characters of note here, with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of red rock, wyoming. the first twist hits early on, and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. satisfying. 8 pts.

i came home late one night and turned on the tv, to see siskel and ebert summarizing their picks of the week. i didn't hear anything about "red rock west", except two thumbs up and see it before it went away. it wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better.the next afternoon, i followed their advice. they were right, it was some of the most fun i have ever had at the movies. as some readers point out, there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes don't ever seem to end. but it's well worth it, for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour. it's the best role that i have ever seen for nicholas cage, but almost everybody seems perfectly cast. dennis hopper goes almost over the top, which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works. the sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene.when i rented it later for my family, it didn't work as well. the long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate, with the distractions at home. it deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you won't be disturbed, watch and listen to every scene, especially in the beginning.

some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds. this is one of those movies. tracing it's roots back to "double indemnity," and "the postman always rings twice" in the 40's - this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90's. nick cage plays the "down on his luck" main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people, town, violence and threat of red rock west. lots of twists and turns, great performances by cage, hopper and walsh, an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop, and seamless directing make this a real joy. favorite line: when cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car, shakes his head and says: "f***in' story of my life."

"red rock west" was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script (by john and rick dahl) that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film. it was brilliantly directed by john dahl and featured a marvellous cast including nicolas cage, dennis hopper, lara flynn boyle and especially j. t. walsh (in a memorable performance) making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed. the film never had much publicity on release (in fact i first caught up with it on tv) and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following.nicolas cage is michael williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of red rock. mistaken for a contract killer named lyle from dallas he is shocked to be offered $10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner wayne brown (the excellent j. t. walsh). he plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn brown's wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double dealings - that cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of! then just to complicate matters even further the real lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing (played by everyone's favourite heavy dennis hopper). when hopper discovers what has happened he goes after cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow.some favourite lines from the film:nicolas cage (to lara flynn boyle): "i hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money".j. t. walsh (to cage): "michael williams. well, michael, you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this".boyle (to cage): "you're not a killer?". cage: "that's right, no. but the guy i'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here".boyle (to cage): "o.k. how you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $10,000 from my husband?".an extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (just 98 minutes) with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals. any film featuring j. t. walsh is o.k. in my book and "red rock west" was one of his best. how sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998. the most prolific period for "film noir" was without any doubt the forties but "red rock west" is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my "top ten" list of all time favourite films. i look forward to more like this from director john dahl. 10/10. clive roberts.

if you like plot turns, this is your movie. it is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next. nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will. the characters are all gritty and engaging. cage is at his best. dennis hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side. jt walsh is perfect in his last performance. laura boyle sizzles. dwight yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo. i categorize this movie as "i am having a really, really, really bad day" film. not a slow minute in this film. a real sleeper. this movie is underrated and, sadly, overlooked.

in any number of films, you can find nicholas cage as a strong, silent hero, dennis hopper as a homicidal maniac, lara flynn boyle as a vamp/tramp, and the late, lamented j.t. walsh as the heavy. these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep, and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche. what a relief, therefore, that john dahl, a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action, directed this nuanced noirish thriller. hopper manages to keep from going over the top, cage shows a little more depth than his usually-superficial action heroes, boyle is by turns sultry, innocent, and scheming, and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character, wayne. dahl's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the big sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store. the plot twists are top-notch, and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains. it isn't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors. but with a director as smart as dahl, you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film. an excellent movie.

vaguely reminiscent of great 1940's westerns, like "the treasure of the sierra madre" (1948), "red rock west" is a story about conscience, greed, and betrayal. michael (nicolas cage) is a down and out, but honest, young man from texas who goes west in search of work and money. he finds both, but not in the way he had expected.the film's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists. excellent cinematography, adroit film editing, and moody western music add tension and suspense. the expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting. and the acting ranges from good to excellent, with great performances from dennis hopper and j.t. walsh. dwight yoakam's specially recorded country/western song provides the film with a strong finale.correctly labeled as neo-noir, "red rock west" strikes me as being something else, as well. the plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing, so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed. ordinarily, i would agree. in this case, however, when combined with the moody atmosphere, and the fact that the small town of red rock seems almost empty of normal daily life, the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that, beyond "noirish", is ... surreal. it's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force michael to come to grips with himself. from this point of view, the coincidences are not script flaws at all. they are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters.all we need here is rod serling, in a postscript, explaining, in his always clearly enunciated voice, that ... a young man, searching for himself, stops in a small, almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere. it's his final layover in a journey to ... the twilight zone.

this is an excellent modern-day film noir...."excellent" in that it's interesting, start-to-finish. there are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief.....but i haven't found anyone who didn't get caught up in this story. the movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. in addition, it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. i labeled this crime movie a "film noir" because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good. even the only supposed-good guy, played by nicholas cage, gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should't have. he also does something at the end which isn't right, but i'm not going the spoil it by saying. suffice to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad they make cage look good!speaking of "bad guys," does anyone do it better than dennis hopper? not many. at least in the "deranged" category, he's tough to beat. lara flynn boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. j.t. walsh gives another great supporting performance, too.this is one of those films that never got much publicity, but it should have. you'll have fun watching this. by the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up!

"deliverance" is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the '70s. while your jaw is dropped during a "terminator" movie, are you really sacred? i don't think so, because you are there to see what new cgis have been strung together - plot matters not.so many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market.....or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. "deliverance" is so frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of "trespassing" into territories where outsiders are not welcome. it is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on "deliverance" didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and "squeal like a pig" wasn't a part of "deulling banjos".i hate the term "hillbillies", because - as some "users" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. much is made of "inbred" - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. "chinatown" should teach us that lesson. however, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. i know lots of "hillbillies" - they are moral people, when left to themselves. their "justice" can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated, just like the "justice" in city streets. they don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites."deliverance" was the last film i found jon voight to do any real acting - i hope i'm wrong. he was extremely underpaid for "midnight cowboy", because he was unknown, but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat. his acting in "deliverance" was superb. it gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as "ordinary" today? his stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. wow! for burt reynolds !!! one must ask what led him into those other tacky films? his manliness, although misguided, in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. ned beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had "versace" stitched on it, but his shell-shocked performance was perfect. as noted, he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie. ronny cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right. several "users" have theorized he was shot, or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey, he committed suicide. no gunshot was heard during the scene and voight and beatty did not find a wound.james dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day. his character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in "aintry". he was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. justice ? - "don't come back up here again". not many "users" knew "hillbillies" were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better? the "mountain-men" were actually mountain-men.......every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. play in? better "fight-for-your-life" in. i've experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part.that we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. to be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. los angeles, where i live, is a perfect example: it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods? they're theirs.in some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from "deliverance" - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. i thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the heck out of me when i watch it. you can have the thrill of danger - i'll stick to the tv. 30-out-of-10.

one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta. the idea of living the chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt reynold's lewis, who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare. but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie, the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. in very bad ways. at the end of the movie, each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week-end on the river but muted into a fight for survival. the movie (except some pretty evident goofs) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath. the photography is excellent as well. voight, reynolds, cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake.

this movie is a classic in every sense of the word. it is very entertaining and also very disturbing. the acting in this movie is well done. the story itself is believable, suspenseful, and well thought out. character development is also done well, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. the villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something. this movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it. not everyone is going to like this film, there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. it is definitely worth watching. this movie is a masterpiece.

i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience. as we put our boats into the water, banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind. this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature. we see it in the bow fishing. we see it in the home made tent. there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman "cracker". the fact that the banker from atlanta (ned beatty) has "bad teeth" is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth. ultimately, the struggle of life and death supersedes "civilized man's" suppositives about "the law". this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer, but alas not soon enough for the characters.

and this is a very disturbing film. i may be wrong, but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor, who transformed the role, and delivered a message.jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent. they are unassuming and unaware; businessmen wanting to enjoy the country. little did they know what would happen next.the photography and sets are realistic and natural. this was before the days of wes craven.what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist. in america, country folk still detest city people; it is almost a century and a half since the civil war.you will enjoy this film. it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia, which still exist. just don't drive past that to mobile, alabama; that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina. 10/10.

*spoilers* four men, ed (jon voight), lewis (burt reynolds), drew (ronny cox) and bobby (ned beatty), decide to go on a rafting trip on the cahulawassee river, before it is flooded.they wanted to have fun, to have a nice weekend in the nature.but when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (bobby), everything begins to go to hell in a handbasket, and this 'nice weekend' will even cost one of the four's life...'deliverance', which in italian is stupidly titled 'un tranquillo weekend di paura' ('a calm weekend of fear'), is the grandad of movies like 'texas chainsaw massacre', 'the hills have eyes', 'wrong turn', 'last house on the left' and all the other 'evil nature/revenge' subgenre films, and one of the scariest, right next to 'the hills have eyes'.based on a book by james dickey (who appears in the movie as sheriff bullard), it's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything, when he doesn't.and the image of the dead man's hand raising from under the water, or the hands holding the rifle from the one-sheet are haunting images that will never leave your mind.deliverance: 9/10.

impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip, on a river about to be replaced by a dam. when locals along the way decide to "have their way" with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors. each of the travelers is outstanding, although voight gives the lead and strongest performance. the rural scenery and culture is well-captured, including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence. i saw this on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). i sort of remember this as a break-out dramatic performance for burt, voight was already established. not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed.

i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention, maybe even missing the first half, so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated. i decided to revisit it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time. i certainly did. this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever. i can't believe i thought this film was boring! a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and ronny cox. this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it, it is truly horrifying. oh, and did i mention that the theme song is great, as well? well it is, and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere.everyone should see this movie for the experience. just don't expect a picnic.

deliverance is john boorman's 1972 horror/thriller movie about a group of four atlanta businessmen (burt reynolds, jon voight, ned beatty and ronnie cox), that undertake a canoe trip down the cahulawassee river before the river is dammed. along the way, a raft (no pun intended) of unpleasant things happen to the men. despite the nasty happenings in this picture, boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely. the location was really chosen well. indeed, this would still be a very nice film to watch, had the canoe trip gone smoothly. the lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible. not only is the location scenic, but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer vilmos zsigmond. it has been said that burt reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman, lewis, is the star acting role in this film. i reckon however, that jon voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man, ed, who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive. in fact, the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman. it was voight himself. to cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts. the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. eric weissberg's and steve mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the duelling banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance. at a couple of other points in the movie, we are treated to more, softer, banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river for all the good points of this film, i did find it a little lacking in purpose. it doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe. the plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere. nevertheless, this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation. i did like it but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it. none really, in fact. it isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour. think of it like rambo: first blood meets three men in a boat. look out for a very young charley boorman as ed's son. i did like this movie, the soundtrack, cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10.

"it's all up to you, ed?" "now you get to play the game." the day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend, on opening day at the cinerama dome in hollywood. i was but fourteen years old. i wasn't even entirely sure what i was seeing, but i will never forgot it, especially the scene with ned beatty.watching it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me quivers.my father was a huge burt reynolds fan, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie.' i had seen two films at the dome prior to this: "grand prix" and "the song of norway." well this wasn't exactly mario andretti or the brady bunch. after leaving the theater, i was shell-shocked.but even at that tender age, i appreciated the artistry...and after seeing again today, am i surprised i was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing, yet extremely well-crafted film.suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend. i don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness.as an adult, i still find it quite disturbing, yet i am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making.burt reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from billy redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to ronny cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job. the sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. the photography, cinematography...all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.the moral questions raised, from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. and the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering. these four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror.it's a classic to be sure. and the phrase "you have a pretty mouth" has been quoted endlessly, from saturday night live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture...as much as "make my day" or "i'll be back" ever were.so what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city, cozy bed, wife and kids? and if you took the measures burt reynolds did (and i would have done the same) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake, or stand trial and take your chances? the bottom line is: deliverance delivers. you can take that to the bank. if this movie doesn't get under your skin, then you are not human.even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question.my favorite part of the film remains the same: ed failing to kill the deer...then changing. life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man. and i suppose that's what this film is all about jon voight, in particular, as ed, gives the best performance here. and he remains one of the more gifted actors in hollywood history, from midnight cowboy to his highly underrated performance as franklin d. roosevelt in pearl harbor, his acting lifts the movie to another level. climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right it needs to be seen to be believed. i guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.briskly paced, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string, this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today. times have changes, but our choices as human beings have not.ten out of ten stars.

when a movie shocks you with it's disturbing, brooding atmosphere, and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography, you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat, masterpiece of a film. although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time. i say, proudly, that i am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. movies like breakdown and the missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think "holy crap, that could happen to me", and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. because i am only 21, i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds, jon voight and ned beatty, albeit i am familiar with them, i didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long. i must say, after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time, i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. burt renyolds plays lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water. renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo. witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers, drew and bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight, once again i have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike renyolds, i have quite liked voight's acting (and i don't regard anaconda when i say that), for example the national treasure movies. voight plays ed, whom, like lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks lewis' machismo. the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous "duelling banjo's" at the start of the film with ronny cox's character drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. as with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. the film's cinematics do not let up, and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film. in wrapping up, deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history.

this is one of the greatest films ever made. it's an all-time classic. the character played by ned beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed. he is a shallow, almost useless, overweight insurance salesman. he is proud of his ignorance, and yet judges the "backwards hicks" to be the ignorant ones. when he compliments the old man on his hat, and the old man responds, "you don't know nothing'," the tone is set. it's true. he really doesn't "know nothing'." but one backwoods anal rape later, the man is practically a warrior. his shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve. the old self is forever dead, left in some far off woods, soon to be under hundreds of feet of water. and what of lewis, our intrepid guide? lewis is a philosopher/hunter/warrior, and he's just about nuts. burt reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film, completely giving himself in to this wonderful role. who wouldn't want to have a friend like lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten/soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in. this film speaks to us on so many levels. the story feels real. it works as a complete action/adventure, with wonderful cinematography, and deliberate, grinding pacing. it works as a bit of a horror film, with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their "sow" ned beatty. but it also works as an art film, using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core. i have seen this film at least fifty times, and every time it comes on, i find i have to watch it. you have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it. this is one deep movie. this is one well-acted movie. and this is one hell of a story. i gave it a 10 out of 10, and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made, along with schindler's list, casablanca, taxi driver, and sling blade, among others. movies that make you think. movies that take you beyond having to think. movies that use a story to make their point, without trying to preach to you. if you think you know deliverance, you might, but again, you might not. it really is that good.

before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film, but listening wasn't doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow! ned beatty, ronny cox, jon voight and burt reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all. the character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend. the acting, dialogue is very very real, as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting. reynolds character "lewis" was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man (i was impressed with his performance!) jon voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end (his character transition was excellent). ned beatty and ronny cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too, and they did... i really was amazed at director boorman's vision of dickey's novel, very impressed. you cannot go your whole life without watching this film. i give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.

"deliverance" is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970's decade from whence so many other exploitation films came.a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives. it's awesome.we are treated to anal rape, vicious beatings, bow and arrow killings, shootings, broken bones, etc... a lot like 1974's "texas chainsaw massacre," to say that "deliverance" is believable would be immature. this would never and could never happen, even in the dark ages of 1972."deliverance" is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action. it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70's and it (arguably) sits on top of that pile with it's great acting, superb cinematography and excellent writing.8 out of 10, kids.

the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters,as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors,playing parts.i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one.burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen,as well as fine performances by ned beatty,ronny cox,bill mckinney,and though he appeared only briefly,james dickey,the man who authored the book upon which the film is based,as the sheriff of aintry.it is somewhat disturbing,and kids,of course,should be shielded from it,but this is great,dramatic cinema.

deliverance is a stunning thriller, every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach-churningly frightening. though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film. the very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation, only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies, is surely the worst nightmare of 99.9% of the world's population. it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory, but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores, questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity. with so many films, you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes, performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl.... but with deliverance, you come away praying to god that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through.four city guys - ed (jon voight), lewis (burt reynolds), drew (ronny cox) and bobby (ned beatty) - head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon-to-be-dammed river. the guys are riding the rapids in pairs, and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland. here, they fall foul of two local woodlanders (bill mckinney and herbert coward), who tie ed to a tree, while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him, perversely, to "squeal like a pig". lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis, being a fair archer, kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest. under great emotional stress, the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area. but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream, and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river.deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale, but even more powerful (and disturbing) as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters. though all the performances are remarkable, one must take particular note of beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down. the film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film straw dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales, and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction. the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at, but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape, with nobody to rely on other than themselves. this truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest.

it's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos. even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene. it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction. it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie. people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene.the acting, plot, cinematography, and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma. the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter. the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them. the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires. not many films can make you feel this creeped out. bottom line: this movie is a classic. i can't really say much more than that.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** packed with memorable moments (such as the quote above, immortalized by primus), deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn. this is not a hollywood film. there are virtually no special effects whatsoever, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty. the city boys look like city boys, and even the tough guy louis, portrayed with precision by burt reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip. this is a perfect example of a what-if film. what if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with, and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives?there is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. when the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film, they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there, and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. this communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them. while drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), louis is having some difficulty buying the gas, and bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is. when the boy turns away from drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session, bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react.this is the kind of thing that we see in deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow. this great scene where a lot of fun was had (including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene until o brother, where art thou?) ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other. these people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. the people that louis, bobby, drew and ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include thou shalt not kill. confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river, hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin.(spoilers) when they are briefly separated from each other and ed and bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant, the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene. i think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the assaults and actual murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film. there is no gratuitous violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect.the move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. the trip down the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up the majority of the film, delivers some spectacularly effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb. it is surprisingly effective when we find out that ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river, because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing.this is a very disturbing film, which is a testament to its success, because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit. the hillbillies are the human (i.e. more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like gator bait and gator bait 2, neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like deliverance. when we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we, as individuals of the audience, are really a fifth member of the team. it's not often that a film is able to come across that way.

this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen. the first time i saw it i was about 9 or 10 years old. i began looking sometime before the rape scene. and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking "what kinda sick movie is this?". today i've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is. it's exciting, frightening, shocking and in it's own unique way disturbing. but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes. it'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river. and there is nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart, brilliant and horrifyingand the acting is also great, especially jon voight and burt reynolds. magnificent acting in this movie. all in all, john boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick chaney's novel. a must see for all the movie lovers

james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. when one reads "deliverance", one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south. when one watches john boorman's film version of the book, one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book. the camera is as descriptive as the narration. the characters are fully realized, and the portrayals are fantastic. i first saw this movie in 1992, after my freshman year of college. i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. among them were "patton", "papillon", and "all the president's men"; fine films, all of them. this one was easily the class of the group. that says a lot.

engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. they are pacifist ed (jon voight), adventurous, violent lewis (burt reynolds), obnoxious bobby (ned beatty) and nice guy drew (ronny cox). the first 40 minute are great--there's the incredible dueling banjos sequence, interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by vilmos zsigmond. then two hillbillies attack ed and bobby. one of them rapes bobby...and the trip becomes a nightmare.just unbelievable. the scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place. to be truthful, beatty's rape has never bothered me--i'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting. this movie also shows how the characters change--ed has his pacifism tested, lewis becomes weak, bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and drew tries to keep himself sane. direction by john boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.the acting is mostly good. voight is just ok in the lead--he's been better. beatty is also just ok--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role. cox is very good especially when things start falling apart. and reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs ever! how this wasn't even nominated for an academy award escapes me. also bill mckinney and herbert coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.a powerful film--not for children. try to see an uncut version--the tv version is butchered. also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images.

this was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that i have ever seen. the first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it. the journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of appalachia. but that is misleading beyond belief. the obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the countryside's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie. i can still hear bobby moaning in pain, and i shudder at the thought. lewis's leg made me wince. yet, while the movie was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. when is it moral, or right to take another individual's life? what can morality drive us to do, or not do, in some cases? and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).

i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep. this, in itself, was testimony that deliverance was a spell-binding movie. i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film. how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done. it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were. case in point - near the end of the "duel", the banjo-playing boy was smiling (loved his banjo), but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel", the kid was too reserved to respond. the river trip never left you bored, for sure. the rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia. i think beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal. i disagree - if you really payed attention, he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following, in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy. it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die, but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.anyway, a great movie, and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a "1", i gave it a "10". this individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias, rather than an objective viewpoint, and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating.

as peckinpah did with straw dogs, and kubrick with a clockwork orange, director john boorman delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance, arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s. burt reynolds, jon voight, ned beatty, and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls "one big, dead lake."but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these "city boys" carousing through their woods. and the following day, continuing on down the river, beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous "squeal!" sequence) by two vicious mountain men (bill mckinney, herbert "cowboy" coward). thus, what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism.james dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. often known for its "squeal!" and "dueling banjos" sequences, deliverance is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal, with the four leading men superb in their roles, and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times. a must-see film for those willing to take a chance.

john boorman's "deliverance" concerns four suburban atlanta dwellers who take a ride down the swift waters of the cahulawassee the river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untamed stretches of land the four friends emphasize different characters: a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk in it (burt reynolds); a passionate family man and a guitar player (ronny cox); an overweight bachelor insurance salesman (ned beatty); and a quiet, thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe (jon voight).what follows is the men's nightmarish explorations against the hostile violence of natureit is also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized men falling prey to the dark laws of the wilderness superbly shot, this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping scenes

after having seen deliverance, movies like pulp fiction don't seem so extreme. maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy, but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.when i started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until i got to the "dueling banjos" scene. in that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible. as i watched drew(ronny cox,robocop)go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get. when you think that the kid has a small banjo, which he could of probably made by hand, compared to drew's nice expensive guitar, you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.as the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits. but what really distinguishes this film, about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip, is that director john boorman(excalibur) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. so as the movie goes into full horror and suspense i really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.the acting is universally excellent. with jon voight(midnight cowboy, enemy of the state) and burt reynolds(boogie nights, striptease) leading the great cast. jon voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. unlike reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start, voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. ned beatty(life) is also good in an extremely hard role, come on getting raped by a hillbilly, while ronny cox turns in a believable performance.one thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any i had ever seen. bill mckinney and herbert "cowboy" coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.overall deliverance was excellent and i suggest it to anyone, except for people with weak stomachs and kids. 10/10. see this movie.

deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james dickey, turned into a brilliant movie by john boorman. it's about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains. up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films i've ever seen. just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. pure talking cinema, deliverance is a very important movie as well. john boorman's best (closely followed by zardoz and excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies. just think about the terrific "duelling banjos" musical score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual "squeal like a pig" rape scene. all the actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances. especially jon voight. a must see motion picture!!

in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time, four city guys confront nature's wrath, in a story of survival. the setting is backwoods georgia, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers.the director, john boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. these locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history. no central casting "actors" could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces, voices, or actions. i don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. as much as anything else, it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.another strength is the film's theme. nature, in the wild, can be violent. how appropriate that the setting should be the american south. very few places in the u.s. are, or have been, as violent as redneck country. in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from it."deliverance" is very much a product of its time when, unlike today, americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. the film's magnificent scenery, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets, and the roar of the river rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. and that is another strength of the film.at an entertainment level, the tension gradually escalates, as the plot proceeds. not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll. very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.finally, the film's technical quality is topnotch. direction and editing are flawless. cinematography is excellent. dialogue is interesting. and the acting is terrific. burt reynolds has never been better. ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job. and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar. if there is a weak link in the film, it is the music, which strikes me as timid.overall, "deliverance" almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure. even for those who don't, the gritty characterizations, the acting, and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film, one of the finest in cinema history.

'deliverance' is a brilliant condensed epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who embark on a canoe trip to briefly commune with nature, and instead have to fight for their sanity, their lives, and perhaps even their souls. the film has aged well. despite being made in the early seventies, it certainly doesn't look particularly dated. it still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post-'death of the sixties' philosophical-and-cultural shock vehicle. there are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it, although the legendary sam peckinpah's stuff would have to be up there. yes, there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film's most confronting scene (which i won't expand upon here) - and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium - but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times. this seems to be generally overlooked (yet in retrospect quite understandably so). the cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing, fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning, and it counterbalances the film as, in a moment of brief madness, we the viewers - along with the characters themselves - are plunged into unrelenting nightmare. 'deliverance's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy, and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment, through to crisis, and aftermath. it all takes place very quickly, which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film. the setting is established effectively through the opening credits. the characters are all well-drawn despite limited time spent on back story. we know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are, like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell. the conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic. this is author james dickey's theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of man's perceived inherent 'goodness' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore. there are no demons or bogeymen here. the predatory hillbillies - as the film's central villains - are merely crude, terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists. they shock because their evil is petty and tangible. the film has no peripheral characters. all reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised homo sapiens in the latter 20th century, and all are very real and recognisable. burt reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung-ho and almost fatally over-confident survivalist, lewis, and it is a shame to think that he really couldn't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up-and-down career ('boogie nights' excluded, perhaps). trust me, if your are not a reynolds fan, you will be impressed with his performance here. john voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self, and ned beatty and ronny cox both make significant contributions. this is simply a great quartet of actors. to conclude, i must speculate as to if and when 'deliverance' author james dickey's 'to the white sea' will be made. for those that enjoyed (?) this film, ttws is a similarly harrowing tale of an american air force pilot's struggle for survival after being shot down over the japanese mainland during ww2. it's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is dickey's trademark, but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular, poetic cinematic experience. there was the suggestion a few years ago that the coen brothers might be producing it, but that eventually came to nothing. being an avid coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on ttws, rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts. returning to 'deliverance', it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest, unnerving brutality being made in these times, and that is pretty shameful. we, the cinema-going public, are all the poorer for this.

unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (man bites dog) or their sheer violence (most peckinpah films), deliverance shocks by its plausibility. certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. the movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. burt reynolds, too, has never been better. the film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of. although so much of it is excellent of itself, deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.

this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons. the co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments. robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where williamson says to ginty, "you sure do get around buddy boy!". i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson, but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely. a film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so. it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look. the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent, so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing.

white fire has so much going for it. with larry bird look-alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache, the movie soars above other low-budget actioners. the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz. with ginty beating up everyone, the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play. then add in fred williamson, some frontal bush, chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes....this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders. if you're looking for some awesome b-action, this is where it's at. now, if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack.

white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs. he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made. i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad, but i made an exception for this one... and i was very glad that i did.it's filled to the brim with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically gory), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a key female character, but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious) and outrageously awkward dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film.ginty, the unusual looking star of the exterminator (and countless other low budget action turds) is amusing in the lead, giving the best performance he could muster. williamson is better than usual, clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee (and he doesn't come in until midway through). the rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish-mash of spanish and italian. she's priceless.again, i can't stress enough how gory it was. it's not so bloody that it's nauseating, but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget. also, when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys, he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers.don't miss white fire. it's a rollicking - if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic.

superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray! the pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes? well, bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all. sick, dude! anyway, as kids they fled from russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. a friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers. when the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine. very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of "white fire", but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause (and i bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i won't reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes. bo's principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, there's the obligatory "we're-falling-in-love" montage and loads of other attractions! my god, what a brilliant experience. the original french title translates itself as "life to survive", which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: none!

what can you say about the film white fire. amazing? fantastic? disturbing? hilarious? these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire. from wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout.our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. when the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch. father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit, and is polite as he gets people's attention before he shoots them, but alas, dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre "halt!", and then promptly wastes the mother. this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred.so now we fast forward about 20 years (30 if you're honest about the hero's age) to beautiful turkey, where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves, or diamond prospectors, or something. ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods, while bo (masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship. they don't seem to have any friends other than each other, and they spend all of their time together. that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as "you know its a shame you're my sister" he says to her while she's stark naked, make for a very dynamic duo. bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid. this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas, and he is overjoyed with his new love.so anyway, there's a lot of fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow plot-lines, fred "the hammer" williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). all of these things are great, but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire. you may be glad you did..or not.

absolutely fantastic trash....this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions etc. it also stars the wonderful belinda mayne as ingrid - not olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although olga turns into ingrid later on in the film (you'll have to watch it to see what i mean).i won't bother to go into the story as it's far too long winded and not very interesting. the relationship between ingrid and her brother bo (robert ginty) is interesting - watch the towel stealing scene to see what i mean.the fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did city of the walking dead (i.e. strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds).i'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though and i couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re-release it so it'll become all the rarer in a few years.anyway i'd recommend it solely for belinda mayne's great nude scenes! that lady's a fox!

wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. i really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. i thought the pace was perfect. the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit-man/ killer working for john rooney (paul newman). he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially. he had nothing and mr. rooney gave him everything. but, his children are unaware that this is his job, and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him, he is placed in an awkward position. and when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. they rob abanks and much more and build a bond. they're the perfect team. hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection. this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were.

in the winter of 1931, supposedly 12-year-old tyler hoechlin (as michael sullivan jr.) wonders what his mobster father tom hanks (michael "mike" sullivan) does for a living. young hoechlin follows mr. hanks to "work" one evening, and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters. this leads - in a very roundabout way - to "godfather"-type paul newman (as john rooney) hiring independent hit-man jude law (as harlen maguire) to track down hoechlin and hanks, who are off to cool their heels in chicago. hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work.looking uncannily like paul peterson ("the donna reed show"), hoechlin does a terrific job for director sam mendes; and, getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002. but, the most striking thing about "road to perdition" is the stunning cinematography of conrad l. hall, which deservedly won a career capping "academy award" for the late photographer. mr. hall's work is truly superlative. this helps make up for the overall impression of a measured, contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals. the deviating end is abruptly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess).******** road to perdition (7/12/02) sam mendes ~ tom hanks, tyler hoechlin, paul newman, jude law

a bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of great depression. it tells us about another notorious hit-man, michael (mike) salliwan. somehow, this time the story turns the other way round: mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss. he succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son, but gets killed in the end. such stories never have happy end after all.the role of mike salliwan senior was wonderfully played by tom hanks, and the part of mr. rooney (the mafia boss) was performed by paul newman. the film makes a great impression, and we hear the well-known phrase "we rob banks". this film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from sam mendes after his american beauty.

this is a film that can make you want to see it again. i especially, liked the way it ended. i did not see the end coming, but when laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back again.the story is gripping and could have been more psychological, but i understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that.hard to believe michael jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away. but, i can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell.some have complained about hanks as a gangster. i believe that isn't justified. if his character had been any harder, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not.eight stars for this one. although it was released in 2002, i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd.

a great gangster film.sam mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie.brilliant star-cast leading with tom hanks(michael sullivan) has done a terrific job.great acting by him again.he is an acting legend.great acting too from paul newman,jude law and daniel craig.casting is just too good.the plot is quite good.you will enjoy the movie.a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's.set in the 1930's,this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era.soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie.a great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son.way underrated for my liking.deserved a fully deserved 10.

this is one of the best movies i've ever seen. it has very good acting by hanks, newman, and everyone else. definitely jude law's best performance. the cinematography is excellent, the editing is about as good, and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie. the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special. to me, it takes a lot to beat godfather, but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest. definitely a best picture nominee in my book.

one of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. the movie is about the sullivan family, obviously michael sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer to say it this way, and an expert one. one of the kids wants to know the work of his father (a terrible mistake), so he hides on his father's car and well, he sees tom hanks in action to say it this way.mafia doesn't rules, in mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but make a wrong work, or make something your "boss" doesn't want, and you're fired, and killed.you can see what i mean in the movie, sullivan jr. sees something he didn't had to see, and well, almost all his family gets killed for that "wrong thing" his son did. the movie is really entertaining, you see how the sullivan's live after being chased by the mafia, or kinda of that.this movie is kinda of sad, shows us about revenge, those dirty works people do, almost everything you like. hopefully the guy is reading this comment doesn't works for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers.this movie receives: 10/10

tom hanks like you've never seen him before. hanks plays michael sullivan, "the angel of death". he is a hitman for his surrogate father john rooney(paul newman)an elderly irish mob boss. sullivan's young son(tyler hoechlin)witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of sullivan's wife and other son. enter jude law as a reporter/photographer willing to kill sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters. filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30's. sometimes the pace bogs down, but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story. director sam mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son. other notable cast members are: dylan baker, stanley tucci, daniel craig and jennifer jason leigh. hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie. make room for some oscars!

this is an excellent film!tom hanks and paul newman performed great!i was really surprised when newman was beating on his son!that was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good.i was very surprised about the end.rent this film today as it is one of tom hanks' best!

an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era. i loved the visuals--very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel.i thought tom hanks was really great in this, he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work (which he didn't fully choose for himself) but still wants to have a normal life for his family. he does the best he can to see that happen. don't want to spoil the plot--but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action/gangster format. (it is violent though.)

tom hanks has been in such hit movies as forrest gump, saving private ryan, and the green mile. for the most part, his roles have been good guys that we cheer for. in road to perdition, his character michael sullivanis a little bit different.in sam mendes' film road to perdition based on the graphic novel by max allan collins, he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the great depression in chicago. what is different about this little road trip is that sullivan is a hit-man who is now being hunted by his former partner. his boss or ex-boss john rooney (paul newman) loves him almost more than his own son, sullivan's partner connor (daniel craig).after a job done the wrong way because of connor, the only witness to his mistake are sullivan and his son who wasn't supposed to be there. so connor tries to take out sullivan and his family, but only gets the wife and other son peter. sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find michael jr. sitting at the table...just sitting. with his wife and child dead, sullivan takes to the road to find answers.the story follows the two as sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid, and for michael who feels like he is to blame for all this. he feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. tyler hoechlin does a terrific job as michael jr. he brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile. his loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town, leaving nothing behind him.mendes' previous hit film was american beauty which received five oscars including best picture and best director. this film didn't do nearly as well at the oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music, sound, and a best actor in a supporting role for paul newman. this picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the midwest and into the legend of mike sullivan: husband, hit-man, and devoted father. this movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come.

this is a beautiful film. the true tale of bond between father and son. this is by far, tom hanks at his finest. tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie. he usually has the nice guy roles. yet in this film,he comes off in this film as a bit gritty, but still emerges smelling like a rose, even until the very last scene, the assassination of his character. the cast of this movie was well put together. i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks' character shoots and kills all of the men in mr. rooney's group. there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene, just simply emotion. i love the look on john rooney, paul newman's character's face when he realizes even before seeing him, that it is tom hanks's character getting revenge, and he knows his fate has come. the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have, adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies.tom hanks is my favorite actor, so this film has a special place in me.

i think that this film is brilliant.there are many reasons why but these are some of them 1)the good acting by tom and tyler 2) brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3) i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam mendes.as well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well. i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years. i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film. lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says " i'm glad it's you" it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant.thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged 16

this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater, although he is my favorite. when i heard he was going to play a hit-man, i was a little stunned thinking "can mr. hanks pull this one off"? and he did in high fashion. this 1930's depression era film is a about loyalty, redemption, and one path that you don't want your children stumbling down. tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan. being the family man, and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman. this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue, which he delivers a knockout performance.on one night of one of his jobs, michael's son michael jr., played by newcomer tyler hoechlin, witnesses the hit. and michael sr.'s partner in crime, fellow stage actor daniel craig can't have that information out. so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr., except michael jr. so the two head for chicago to get conner rooney(son of paul newman's mr. rooney).the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right, even though son is along for the ride. while on this deadly journey, someone has hired a hit for michael sr. the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire, played by a stain-teethed jude law.the movie will have you feeling the old days. and with thomas newman's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it, you can't help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes. so sit back, and enjoy the wild ride.

i loved this film! i'm a true tom hanks fan, and i have always been impressed with all of his work. from his most dramatic roles like cast away, the green mile, saving private ryan, forrest gump, apollo 13 & philadelphia. to his hilarious roles like a league of their own, turner and hooch, catch me if you can, the lady killers, big & of course toy story. but in this film hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen. tyler hoechlin, an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance. he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career, i believe he will do great things. paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen. he is truly a legend. we can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film, but still helped make it great. the beautiful & very talented jennifer jason leigh, who's performance in bastard out of carolina & single white female i will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as hank's wife in the film and does a superb job. liam aiken is another found treasure in film. he does such a great job with such a small role, and like his roles in lemony snickets, and sweet november, and i dreamed of africa he gives a great performance.

after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental dvds, i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes? for a number of reasons, "american beauty" doesn't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade. for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins, and is simply wonderful to watch because of it. and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks' name on it (still can't watch "big" without wanting a cat to kick), i'm glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you'll kick yourself for if you miss it.normally squeaky-clean hanks plays michael sullivan, a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early 1930's. he is also a professional hit-man to mob boss john rooney (paul newman) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons. but after his eldest (tyler hoechlin) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing, the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up. soon, father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit-man (a menacing jude law) is waiting for them.on the face of it, it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i've said, this isn't really about gangsters at all. it's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances. hanks is (*grits teeth*) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivan's son. in all honesty, there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless. as is the cinematography and costumes (and it's not often i praise costumes!) which recreates the 30's with stunning effect. there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades. this could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30's look was difficult to put down - but it doesn't and that deserves every bit of credit. chicago especially looks fantastic, lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats. true time-travel, even if a little cgi is needed.the story is also a winner, offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain. law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you don't have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster. the film is decidedly noir-ish, driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are (finally) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts. the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy-gun shootouts and extortion rackets. it can feel a little slow in places, especially if you're used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences (like yours truly) but sometimes, words can speak louder than actions. mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his oscar-winning debut, a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch. "road to perdition" may not be to everyone's tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon.

road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newman's score . it's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of scent of a woman , meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway , irish gangsters is miller's crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leone's gangster epics. despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed . but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director mendes is road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . i've never been all that keen on tom hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent - newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top . while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become james bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career

having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the sweltering heat, i could not have been more pleased. the road to perdition, directed by sam mendes (american beauty), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time. perhaps i'm just getting old; perhaps i've just seen the same themes recycled time and again. but this movie is indeed different.the story opens with young michael sullivan jr. facing out to the sea, contemplating the duality of his father's legacy -- one of the best men to ever live, one of the most evil. this duality snakes its way throughout the movie. the story revolves around crime boss john rooney (paul newman) and michael sullivan (tom hanks), the young man rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal "angel of death." rooney is tied by blood to his own son, but tied by love and loyalty to michael. young michael jr., intrigued by the stories he reads, steals away in his father's car one night while dad goes off to "work" with connor rooney, heir to the family "business." connor lets the situation get out of hand, and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder -- witnessed by michael jr. upon the discovery that young michael has seen what he should not have seen, the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide. soon, michael sr. is on the run with his young son, pursued by contract killer harlen "the reporter" maguire (jude law).i will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers. however, i strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie: problems between sons and fathers (michael sr & jr., john rooney & son connor), between the world at home and the world at "work", between good and evil, between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are, between "clean" money and "dirty", between the town of perdition and perdition as hell. and along the way, savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer conrad l. hall (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography): rain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound. not only has 75-year-old hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career, but 77-year-old paul newman offers one of his best performances ever.yes ... i may be getting old. but i've seen a lot ... and this is fresh and invigorating. the road to perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre, to films of the 40s, to dark comic-book figures lurking in the darkness, to villains and heroes, to american film in general. go see it!

this is the best mob film ever made. it deserved more then what it got at the oscars. nominated for things like its score, art direction, supporting role (newman), this film could have easily been nominated for best picture, director (mendes), actor (hanks), supporting actor (newman and law) and won!! hanks gives one of his best performances, and the kid who played michel jr. was so good that i'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today. critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit. but besides the incredible performances, another real star of this film is the incredible music. this was by far the best score of the year. it was nominated but didn't win. this is a great film that should be seen by everyone. my grade-a+

frankly, this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors.the opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts. the movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship. it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes.the premise is that the fathers in the move, hit-man michael sullivan (tom hanks) and his crime boss john rooney (paul newman), love their sons and will do anything to protect them. but rooney's son connor is even more evil than the rest. he kills one of rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. when connor learns that sullivan's son michael witnessed it, he mistakenly kills sullivan's other son (and sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses.sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price, even at the terribly high price of perdition. rooney, who in one scene curses the day connor was born, refuses to give up his son connor to sullivan, and hires a contract killer named maguire (jude law) to kill sullivan and his son. so rooney joins his son connor on the road to perdition.for the rest of the movie, accompanied by his surviving son young michael, sullivan pursues connor rooney down the road to perdition, and maguire pursues sullivan. when sullivan confronts rooney in a church basement, and demands that he give up connor because connor murdered his family, rooney says - "michael, there are only murderers in this room,.., and there's only one guarantee, none of us will see heaven." as the movie ends, somewhat predictably, one character is saved and one character repents.i'm not a big tom hanks fan, but he does step out of character to play hit-man sullivan convincingly, giving a subtle and laconic performance. newman does well as the old irish gangster rooney, showing a hard edge in his face and manner, his eyes haunted by connor's misdeeds. jude law plays maguire in a suitably creepy way. tyler hoechlin plays young michael naturally and without affectation.the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys. the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of depression era illinois. the greens belonged to the younger sons and that state's rural flatlands. thomas newman's lush, sonorous and haunting music had faint irish overtones and was played out in copland-like arrangements. the sets were authentic mid-western urban - factories, churches. the homes shone with gleaming woodwork.the excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes, distinctive acting, and enveloping music and cinematography. the only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y, the movie's only nod to political correctness.i give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film.

this is one of the best made movies from 2002. maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by sam mendes, who debuted with 'american beauty'.it tells the story of a gangster named michael sullivan (tom hanks) who is seen by his son (tyler hoechlin) on one of his jobs. michael's boss, john rooney (paul newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son connor rooney (daniel craig) sets both his father and michael up, leading to the death of michael's wife (jennifer jason leigh) and second son. michael thinks rooney is responsible and rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man harlen maguire (jude law) to finish the job. since michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss frank nitti (stanley tucci).in a way 'road to perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. this movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. all these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. that hoechlin is not a annoying kid and hanks, law and newman know how to act helps, of course.based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. the scenes between the adult hanks and the child hoechlin help in that area. see this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.

conrad hall went out with a bang. the great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on. he did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see.of course, the acting ain't bad when you have tom hanks and paul newman playing the leads! the amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.none of the characters in here, frankly, are "good guys" as hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss newman. hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies! huh?as good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is cinematographer hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens. his work is just awesome.

i f you thought sam mendes' first film, the much heralded american beauty was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim 30's gangster melodrama road to perdition. some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to the godfather, a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with mr. mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. if the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, road to perdition is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. what it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over. as with american beauty, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal.this story of a hit man (tom hanks) and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss, an elderly irish mob leader (paul newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. the father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom.that being said , i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen. veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here . the production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. mr. mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color, and he and mr. hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme.if i have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : daniel craig is the classic "man you love to hate", the spoiled, impulsive son of newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable jude law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. but acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here. if a rolls-royce was a movie , i've no doubt it would look like road to perdition.

i loved so much about this movie...the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack...it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. if we lived in elizabethan days, i'd say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy. but since we don't, let's say it's more like a drama-suspense movie.the plot is simple, but the story is complex. the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. much of the story is shown rather than told, which i find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling.i don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case i do. (though i did enjoy the book too.) i've bought the dvd, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.(i also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after i saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him. he loved it - and the discussion.)

this couldn't have been better. the strong restraints on mike sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way. tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career. young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel; playing the basis character for the story. and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time.this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner. this is a father/son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles. mike sullivan had no father as a child, so john rooney took him in. although a generous man, mr. rooney involved himself in organized crime. therefore, the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business. now, sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe, but at the same time pay back his boss. the events to follow, will test sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate.with a great adaptation by david self, the dialogue comes out seldomly, but yet very virtuous. the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting (brilliant art direction by richard l. johnson & nancy haigh) covered with a dark rainy (snow on the ground) exterior. driving the story, is thomas newman's wonderful irish score, settling in only when necessary.but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l. hall's beautiful photography. this is some of the best cinematography i've seen; and i watch a lot of films. the scene when mike and michael are in the car, entering chicago is quite impressive. the shot starts at the front of the car, revealing mike(hanks) through the windshield. it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car, to see michael(hoechlin) awakening and peering out his side window. as it continues, it trucks sideways and dollys back, completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's chicago.with a great cast and crew, the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film. i'm talking about sam mendes, who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty. (won him various awards) before american beauty, mendes worked as a play director for the british theater, but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater. with only two films, sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors (in a list of about twenty-five).the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly. the photography, acting and story is phenominal. i'm still waiting for scorcesee's gangs of new york, but for now, i'm fully confident in saying that this is the "best film of the year". considering it's competition (signs, insomnia, minority report) thats a strong statement.

acting this film is a very well acted film. i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times; but for the most part, the acting is very good. the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as harlen maguire. he was incredible! tom hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible. paul newman, good as always. cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece (and i rarely use that word). conrad hall is a true genius. if at any point in the movie you were to pause it, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out. when the camera is still, there is a postcard like quality to the screen. when the camera is moving, every shot is planned to understated perfection. but it doesn't stop there. conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i've seen. his work on this movie made it what it is. this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr, black hawk down, hero, cthd, moulin rouge, and vertigo. story people will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, i believe they missed the point of the movie. it is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other. the screen writing is worthy of an oscar. music thomas newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores i've herd. direction sam mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director. the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world. i will be on the lookout for the next sam mendes film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies i've ever seen.

road to perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty. this is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.it's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of depression when the, michael sullivan, a father of two children, played by great tom hanks (i'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by paul newman. his eldest son, a thirteen years boy michael sullivan jr., perfectly played by young tyler hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by john rooney, son of his father boss. such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. the atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. but the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. they are shown so deeply, strong and believable. tom hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. i believe road to perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.my grade 10 out of 10

this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast. all of them are experienced actors and have played in several tv series and plays. sahan gokbakar is a well known comedian in turkey. it's kind of strange to see him in a thriller, while he is at the peak of his comedy career in turkey. this movie is togan gokbakar's first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director. but they all did a good job. we are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast. they seem very promising for the future of the turkish film industry. doga rutkay being long time sweetheart of sahan gokbakar, is also a talented actress, who is known for her recent play in "number 27" theatrical play and several tv series.

it is an excellent thriller from turkey which can make sense.great job from gokbakar brothers.first of all,i want to point on screen play.generally screen play in most films from turkey is not enough,but gen has the best shots to be said "perfect".and also transition parts are really excellent.on the other hand,"gen" has a great topic that influence everyone.especially,a woman ,who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium ,has a mother that is a habitual insanity.principal causes and psychological consequences are given in gen.the only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints.there is an impressive aggression part doga rutkay and sahan gokbakar played.this performance may be more realistic than " irréversible(monica bellucci) ".the last thing i want to say is "watch this movie,you'll get confused"

a young ( only 21 ) director with great talent, a powerful scenario, young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background...one of the first tries of a thriller in turkish cinema, which seems in the future we'll have some more based on the success...shot on high definition video, the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers, especially the american thrillers. the technical and cinematographic character is quite well done, the scenes are all well worked on. not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you're in a blood bath too...the scenario is quite wise but with certain clues, a clever audience can easily predict what's going on and at the end when everything settles down you're getting somehow weird to conclude the result.well done tiglon, one of the biggest dvd distributors in turkey, it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company...

this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit. she brings her way of dealing with the law, which means more than simple convictions. the strong performance of the main character, supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable.

despite of the success in comedy or drama, the turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller. "okul-d@bbe" are good examples for the awful horror turkish films.but if you watch "gen" you will understand that it is a strike. the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark. also the special features are colorful and not cheap. the soundtracks fit the movie, but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary.as a result "gen" does not add any difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint thriller fans. in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey. (7/10)

i must say, i was surprised with the quality of the movie. it was far better than i expected. scenario and acting is quite good. the director made a good job as well. although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it is a decent movie overall. the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end. the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good. the plot was clear, consistent and well thought. some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. moral of the story, it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good.

the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film, and also relates to the dogma films.did you ever get bored of those hollywood-style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of? fed up with the married-living-single cop, the divorced-but-family-man, the personified doughnut and the tough hunter? ever wondered how the real police work is like?well, for germany, this film shows you. set in the north between west germany and east germany, former ddr, an laid off post office clerk starts her job, fresh from policeschool. she quickly finds her way around the usual customers, and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman... but this is not much fun.other german crime films like derrick, der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects. these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder. good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view, even more if you know that part of germany a bit.

i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really strong. might make you feel different.

wow! i have seen so many bad low budget films lately, but this one is great. the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police. this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time. a perfect tradeoff!

there are many police dramas doing the rounds. i am not sure why. it's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil.this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the baltic area. no attempt is made to glamorise the police. they are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations.this is not a pleasant film. not one to relax you. there is not much feeling of optimism in it. the police seem to be involved in a losing battle. tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family break-ups, and more distressed children. let's face it. this is the world we live in.as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating. the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny, a 12 year old from a broken family. anne has her own way of patching things up. she turns a blind eye to benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can. i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny's father. it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs. after all, the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children.well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment,

hmmmm, want a little romance with your mystery? this has it. i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie. but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel, whatever the heck that is. had the romance been ditched, the story might have been a little too weak. the mystery here wasn't too bad, quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage. oh well. i thought mel harris was pretty good; her short skirts, i think, added some sex appeal... but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast, maybe with a more well known tv movie actor. the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little edgier, a little darker, more adventurous. one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations. that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest. possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect. not good. had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen, picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background. this was just a tv-movie, though, so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery. overall, twasn't really a bad movie. i'll tell you what, this was absolutely the best canadian-hungarian production i have ever seen! (and the only that i know of.) i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made-for-tv movie, giving it a grade of c-

the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between.rob stewart is a wonderful actor i don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap. as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob it's only by five years.rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel. i'm sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller jane.he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini series.they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at.

on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. i enjoyed this movie. dean cain was excellent in the role of bob. lexa doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart. dean cain's performance was an usual excellent. he gets better with every film he does. my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob, camilla and the baby. it was left for the viewer to decide

warning! spoilers ahead! spoilers i've seen movie in german, so it might be, that i missed some clues. despite some weakness in the plot, it's a movie that came through to me. i liked especially lexa doig's acting. sometimes i got impression, that she *is* camille. but i can't stop wondering, what happened at the end with bob, cassie and baby. i belive, she, after initially being set on bob, eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him. otherwise it's a bit strange, that she would carry his baby and love it. it's up to viewer to decide - and i don't like such endings. dean cain was as good as ever, eric roberts .. well, i've seen him better but also worse. i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story. bottom line is, i liked it very much.

outrage is pretty good movie! robert culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part! its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do? when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things. it isn't right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man! anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one!

i remember this movie. quite intense for an 11 year old. good editing, i felt terrible for the st. bernard. i'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast, but the signal is passing pluto as i write this. robert culp. a highlight of his career. i am just glad i didn't live in that neighborhood. oh those 70's. what a decade. if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody. so what are they waiting for? an excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys. it was very intense. i think it was filmed in los angeles. certainly not made in lodi nj. the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film...and then they left the carcass on the stoop. rotten kids.

robert culp (they call his character "doctor"...i think he's a vet or something) and family move to an affluent, low-tax, zero-law-enforcement suburb. lantern-jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and "go cruising" through his front yard at 60mph. he presses charges, which arouses the kids' ire, and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign.marilyn manson, er, marlyn mason rather, plays his fretful, boiled-celery wife, who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses, and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services. but the system is getting culp nowhere, and he's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music. and we all know what movie people do when the system fails...(but this is based on a true story, which makes it even better).it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient '70s funk-o-matic "teenage" theme music that warns us when they're up to no good, this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even-handedly (really!). it doesn't make a big generational thing out of it. kudos for that.anyway, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice, and you like fire, and you like justice for dogs by way of fire, and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are "too damn soft," then this flick's ethos is up your alley. no, it's not really "good," at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word. there's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it, it's just sort of a feature-length psa for vigilantism. it does, however, capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other, beloved works. remember in frank miller's the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city? remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully's face in? remember how cool that was? or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors? yeah, mon.unfortunately, this was a 1973 made-for-tv movie that i just happened to catch at 4am on my local wb affiliate, and it's probably not destined for dvd release. but after being inspired by this film, do you think i'm gonna just sit here and take it!?!

this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama. my all-time favourite actor, robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system, kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime, and homicidal psychosis. the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes, and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison. but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie, building the fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feel of the whole california setting. the cars are really great as well, as i recall. i give this film a 10, and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute. remember, just because it's made-for-television doesn't mean it isn't great art.

this is a very good, made for tv film. it depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around. the worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog. the teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family. but boy!, does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end. the father/homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is. he stands up to them and protects his home and his family. a very good actor..i might add.i watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9. i have never seen it again on tv and would like to. definitely a good one! it's the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and can't stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend. it's the kind they just don't show anymore.it is definitely worth seeing!
